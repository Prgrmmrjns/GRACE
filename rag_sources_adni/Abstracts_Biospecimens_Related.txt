IMPORTANCE: For the Alzheimer disease (AD) therapies to effectively attenuate 
clinical progression, it may be critical to intervene before the onset of 
amyloid-associated tau spreading, which drives neurodegeneration and cognitive 
decline. Time points at which amyloid-associated tau spreading accelerates may 
depend on individual risk factors, such as apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE4) 
carriership, which is linked to faster disease progression; however, the 
association of ApoE4 with amyloid-related tau spreading is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess if ApoE4 carriers show accelerated amyloid-related tau 
spreading and propose amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) thresholds at 
which tau spreading accelerates in ApoE4 carriers vs noncarriers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study including combined ApoE 
genotyping, amyloid PET, and longitudinal tau PET from 2 independent samples: 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 237; collected from 
April 2015 to August 2022) and Avid-A05 (n = 130; collected from December 2013 
to July 2017) with a mean (SD) tau PET follow-up time of 1.9 (0.96) years in 
ADNI and 1.4 (0.23) years in Avid-A05. ADNI is an observational multicenter 
Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative and Avid-A05 an observational clinical 
trial. Participants classified as cognitively normal (152 in ADNI and 77 in 
Avid-A05) or mildly cognitively impaired (107 in ADNI and 53 in Avid-A05) were 
selected based on ApoE genotyping, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal tau PET data 
availability. Participants with ApoE ε2/ε4 genotype or classified as having 
dementia were excluded. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
connectivity templates were based on 42 healthy participants in ADNI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mediation of amyloid PET on the association between 
ApoE4 status and subsequent tau PET increase through Braak stage regions and 
interaction between ApoE4 status and amyloid PET with annual tau PET increase 
through Braak stage regions and connectivity-based spreading stages (tau 
epicenter connectivity ranked regions).
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 73.9 (7.35) years among the 237 ADNI participants 
and 70.2 (9.7) years among the 130 Avid-A05 participants. A total of 107 
individuals in ADNI (45.1%) and 45 in Avid-A05 (34.6%) were ApoE4 carriers. 
Across both samples, we found that higher amyloid PET-mediated ApoE4-related tau 
PET increased globally (ADNI b, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.28; P = .001 and Avid-A05 
b, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.54; P < .001) and in earlier Braak regions. Further, we 
found a significant association between ApoE4 status by amyloid PET interaction 
and annual tau PET increases consistently through early Braak- and 
connectivity-based stages where amyloid-related tau accumulation was accelerated 
in ApoE4carriers vs noncarriers at lower centiloid thresholds, corrected for age 
and sex.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings in this study indicate that 
amyloid-related tau accumulation was accelerated in ApoE4 carriers at lower 
amyloid levels, suggesting that ApoE4 may facilitate earlier amyloid-driven tau 
spreading across connected brain regions. Possible therapeutic implications 
might be further investigated to determine when best to prevent tau spreading 
and thus cognitive decline depending on ApoE4 status.

IMPORTANCE: The recent proliferation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers 
has raised questions about their preferential association with the hallmark 
pathologies of Alzheimer disease (AD): amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary 
tangles.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma p-tau 
biomarkers preferentially reflect cerebral β-amyloidosis or neurofibrillary 
tangle aggregation measured with positron emission tomography (PET).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional study of 2 
observational cohorts: the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia 
(TRIAD) study, with data collected between October 2017 and August 2021, and the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with data collected between 
September 2015 and November 2019. TRIAD was a single-center study, and ADNI was 
a multicenter study. Two independent subsamples were derived from TRIAD. The 
first TRIAD subsample comprised individuals assessed with CSF p-tau (p-tau181, 
p-tau217, p-tau231, p-tau235), [18F]AZD4694 amyloid PET, and [18F]MK6240 tau 
PET. The second TRIAD subsample included individuals assessed with plasma p-tau 
(p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231), [18F]AZD4694 amyloid PET, and [18F]MK6240 tau 
PET. An independent cohort from ADNI comprised individuals assessed with CSF 
p-tau181, [18F]florbetapir PET, and [18F]flortaucipir PET. Participants were 
included based on the availability of p-tau and PET biomarker assessments 
collected within 9 months of each other. Exclusion criteria were a history of 
head trauma or magnetic resonance imaging/PET safety contraindications. No 
participants who met eligibility criteria were excluded.
EXPOSURES: Amyloid PET, tau PET, and CSF and plasma assessments of p-tau 
measured with single molecule array (Simoa) assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Associations between p-tau biomarkers with amyloid 
PET and tau PET.
RESULTS: A total of 609 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.9 [13.6] years; 347 
female [57%]; 262 male [43%]) were included in the study. For all 4 
phosphorylation sites assessed in CSF, p-tau was significantly more closely 
associated with amyloid-PET values than tau-PET values (p-tau181 difference, 
13%; 95% CI, 3%-22%; P = .006; p-tau217 difference, 11%; 95% CI, 3%-20%; 
P = .003; p-tau231 difference, 15%; 95% CI, 5%-22%; P < .001; p-tau235 
difference, 9%; 95% CI, 1%-19%; P = .02) . These results were replicated with 
plasma p-tau181 (difference, 11%; 95% CI, 1%-22%; P = .02), p-tau217 
(difference, 9%; 95% CI, 1%-19%; P = .02), p-tau231 (difference, 13%; 95% CI, 
3%-24%; P = .009), and CSF p-tau181 (difference, 9%; 95% CI, 1%-21%; P = .02) in 
independent cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cross-sectional study of 2 
observational cohorts suggest that the p-tau abnormality as an early event in AD 
pathogenesis was associated with amyloid-β accumulation and highlights the need 
for careful interpretation of p-tau biomarkers in the context of the 
amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration, or A/T/(N), framework.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) aims to improve 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. Since 2006, ADNI has shared clinical, 
neuroimaging, and cognitive data, and biofluid samples. We used conventional 
search methods to identify 1459 publications from 2021 to 2022 using ADNI 
data/samples and reviewed 291 impactful studies. This review details how ADNI 
studies improved disease progression understanding and clinical trial 
efficiency. Advances in subject selection, detection of treatment effects, 
harmonization, and modeling improved clinical trials and plasma biomarkers like 
phosphorylated tau showed promise for clinical use. Biomarkers of amyloid beta, 
tau, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and others were prognostic with 
individualized prediction algorithms available online. Studies supported the 
amyloid cascade, emphasized the importance of neuroinflammation, and detailed 
widespread heterogeneity in disease, linked to genetic and vascular risk, 
co-pathologies, sex, and resilience. Biological subtypes were consistently 
observed. Generalizability of ADNI results is limited by lack of cohort 
diversity, an issue ADNI-4 aims to address by enrolling a diverse cohort.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has 
accumulated 15 years of clinical, neuroimaging, cognitive, biofluid biomarker 
and genetic data, and biofluid samples available to researchers, resulting in 
more than 3500 publications. This review covers studies from 2018 to 2020.
METHODS: We identified 1442 publications using ADNI data by conventional search 
methods and selected impactful studies for inclusion.
RESULTS: Disease progression studies supported pivotal roles for regional 
amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau deposition, and identified underlying genetic 
contributions to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular disease, immune response, 
inflammation, resilience, and sex modulated disease course. Biologically 
coherent subgroups were identified at all clinical stages. Practical algorithms 
and methodological changes improved determination of Aβ status. Plasma Aβ, 
phosphorylated tau181, and neurofilament light were promising noninvasive 
biomarkers. Prognostic and diagnostic models were externally validated in ADNI 
but studies are limited by lack of ethnocultural cohort diversity.
DISCUSSION: ADNI has had a profound impact in improving clinical trials for AD.

BACKGROUND: Hearing impairment was recently identified as the most prominent 
risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the link between 
hearing impairment and dementia are still unclear.
METHODS: We investigated the association of hearing performance with cognitive 
function, brain structure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in 
cross-sectional, longitudinal, mediation and genetic association analyses across 
the UK Biobank (N = 165,550), the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and Lifestyle 
(CABLE, N = 863) study, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI, N = 1770) database.
FINDINGS: Poor hearing performance was associated with worse cognitive function 
in the UK Biobank and in the CABLE study. Hearing impairment was significantly 
related to lower volume of temporal cortex, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobe, 
precuneus, etc., and to lower integrity of white matter (WM) tracts. 
Furthermore, a higher polygenic risk score (PRS) for hearing impairment was 
strongly associated with lower cognitive function, lower volume of gray matter, 
and lower integrity of WM tracts. Moreover, hearing impairment was correlated 
with a high level of CSF tau protein in the CABLE study and in the ADNI 
database. Finally, mediation analyses showed that brain atrophy and tau 
pathology partly mediated the association between hearing impairment and 
cognitive decline.
INTERPRETATION: Hearing impairment is associated with cognitive decline, brain 
atrophy and tau pathology, and hearing impairment may reflect the risk for 
cognitive decline and dementia as it is related to bran atrophy and tau 
accumulation in brain. However, it is necessary to assess the mechanism in 
future animal studies.

A combination of plasma phospho-tau (P-tau) and other accessible biomarkers 
might provide accurate prediction about the risk of developing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) dementia. We examined this in participants with subjective 
cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment from the BioFINDER (n = 340) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 543) studies. Plasma 
P-tau, plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, plasma neurofilament light, APOE genotype, brief 
cognitive tests and an AD-specific magnetic resonance imaging measure were 
examined using progression to AD as outcome. Within 4 years, plasma P-tau217 
predicted AD accurately (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.83) in BioFINDER. 
Combining plasma P-tau217, memory, executive function and APOE produced higher 
accuracy (AUC = 0.91, P < 0.001). In ADNI, this model had similar AUC (0.90) 
using plasma P-tau181 instead of P-tau217. The model was implemented online for 
prediction of the individual probability of progressing to AD. Within 2 and 6 
years, similar models had AUCs of 0.90-0.91 in both cohorts. Using cerebrospinal 
fluid P-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and neurofilament light instead of plasma biomarkers did 
not improve the accuracy significantly. The clinical predictions by memory 
clinic physicians had significantly lower accuracy (4-year AUC = 0.71). In 
summary, plasma P-tau, in combination with brief cognitive tests and APOE 
genotyping, might greatly improve the diagnostic prediction of AD and facilitate 
recruitment for AD trials.

BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging measures and chemical biomarkers may be important 
indices of clinical progression in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and need to be evaluated longitudinally.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize cross-sectionally and longitudinally clinical 
measures in normal controls, subjects with MCI, and subjects with mild Alzheimer 
disease (AD) to enable the assessment of the utility of neuroimaging and 
chemical biomarker measures.
METHODS: A total of 819 subjects (229 cognitively normal, 398 with MCI, and 192 
with AD) were enrolled at baseline and followed for 12 months using standard 
cognitive and functional measures typical of clinical trials.
RESULTS: The subjects with MCI were more memory impaired than the cognitively 
normal subjects but not as impaired as the subjects with AD. Nonmemory cognitive 
measures were only minimally impaired in the subjects with MCI. The subjects 
with MCI progressed to dementia in 12 months at a rate of 16.5% per year. 
Approximately 50% of the subjects with MCI were on antidementia therapies. There 
was minimal movement on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale for the normal control subjects, slight movement for the subjects with 
MCI of 1.1, and a modest change for the subjects with AD of 4.3. Baseline CSF 
measures of Abeta-42 separated the 3 groups as expected and successfully 
predicted the 12-month change in cognitive measures.
CONCLUSION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative has successfully 
recruited cohorts of cognitively normal subjects, subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and subjects with Alzheimer disease with anticipated baseline 
characteristics. The 12-month progression rate of MCI was as predicted, and the 
CSF measures heralded progression of clinical measures over 12 months.

INTRODUCTION: We studied whether fully automated Elecsys cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) immunoassay results were concordant with positron emission tomography 
(PET) and predicted clinical progression, even with cutoffs established in an 
independent cohort.
METHODS: Cutoffs for Elecsys amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ), total tau/Aβ(1-42), and 
phosphorylated tau/Aβ(1-42) were defined against [18F]flutemetamol PET in 
Swedish BioFINDER (n = 277) and validated against [18F]florbetapir PET in 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 646). Clinical progression in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 619) was studied.
RESULTS: CSF total tau/Aβ(1-42) and phosphorylated tau/Aβ(1-42) ratios were 
highly concordant with PET classification in BioFINDER (overall percent 
agreement: 90%; area under the curve: 94%). The CSF biomarker statuses 
established by predefined cutoffs were highly concordant with PET classification 
in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (overall percent agreement: 
89%-90%; area under the curves: 96%) and predicted greater 2-year clinical 
decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Strikingly, tau/Aβ ratios 
were as accurate as semiquantitative PET image assessment in predicting visual 
read-based outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Elecsys CSF biomarker assays may provide reliable alternatives to 
PET in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Mental symptoms have been shown to be associated with dementia. As 
the most common neuropsychiatric disorder, it is unclear whether and why anxiety 
increases the risk of cognitive progression in elderly.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the longitudinal effects of 
anxiety on cognitive impairment in non-dementia elderly and to explore the 
underlying biological processes using multi-omics including microarray-based 
transcriptomics, mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical markers, and brain diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI). The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Chinese 
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) and Shanghai Mental Health Centre 
(SMHC) cohorts were included.
FINDINGS: Anxiety was found to increase the risk of subsequent cognitive 
progression in the ADNI, and a similar result was observed in the CLHLS cohort. 
Enrichment analysis indicated activated axon/synapse pathways and suppressed 
mitochondrial pathways in anxiety, the former confirmed by deviations in 
frontolimbic tract morphology and altered levels of axon/synapse markers, and 
the latter supported by decreased levels of carnitine metabolites. Mediation 
analysis revealed that anxiety's effect on the longitudinal cognition was 
mediated by brain tau burden. Correlations of mitochondria-related expressed 
genes with axon/synapse proteins, carnitine metabolites, and cognitive changes 
were found.
INTERPRETATION: This study provides cross-validated epidemiological and 
biological evidence that anxiety is a risk factor for cognitive progression in 
non-dementia elderly, and that axon/synapse damage in the context of energy 
metabolism imbalance may contribute to this phenomenon.

IMPORTANCE: Knowledge is lacking on the prevalence and prognosis of individuals 
with a β-amyloid-negative, tau-positive (A-T+) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarker profile.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of a CSF A-T+ biomarker profile and 
investigate its clinical implications.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of the 
cross-sectional multicenter University of Gothenburg (UGOT) cohort (November 
2019-January 2021), the longitudinal multicenter Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort (individuals with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 
no cognitive impairment; September 2005-May 2022), and 2 Wisconsin cohorts, 
Wisconsin Alzheimer Disease Research Center and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer 
Prevention (WISC; individuals without cognitive impairment; February 
2007-November 2020). This was a multicenter study, with data collected from 
referral centers in clinical routine (UGOT) and research settings (ADNI and 
WISC). Eligible individuals had 1 lumbar puncture (all cohorts), 2 or more 
cognitive assessments (ADNI and WISC), and imaging (ADNI only) performed on 2 
separate occasions. Data were analyzed on August 2022 to April 2023.
EXPOSURES: Baseline CSF Aβ42/40 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181; cognitive 
tests (ADNI: modified preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite [mPACC]; WISC: 
modified 3-test PACC [PACC-3]). Exposures in the ADNI cohort included 
[18F]-florbetapir amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), and cross-sectional 
tau-PET (ADNI: [18F]-flortaucipir, WISC: [18F]-MK6240).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CSF AT 
biomarker profiles and continuous longitudinal global cognitive outcome and 
imaging biomarker trajectories in A-T+ vs A-T- groups. Secondary outcomes 
included cross-sectional tau-PET.
RESULTS: A total of 7679 individuals (mean [SD] age, 71.0 [8.4] years; 4101 male 
[53%]) were included in the UGOT cohort, 970 individuals (mean [SD] age, 73 
[7.0] years; 526 male [54%]) were included in the ADNI cohort, and 519 
individuals (mean [SD] age, 60 [7.3] years; 346 female [67%]) were included in 
the WISC cohort. The prevalence of an A-T+ profile in the UGOT cohort was 4.1% 
(95% CI, 3.7%-4.6%), being less common than the other patterns. Longitudinally, 
no significant differences in rates of worsening were observed between A-T+ and 
A-T- profiles for cognition or imaging biomarkers. Cross-sectionally, A-T+ had 
similar tau-PET uptake to individuals with an A-T- biomarker profile.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest that the CSF A-T+ biomarker profile 
was found in approximately 5% of lumbar punctures and was not associated with a 
higher rate of cognitive decline or biomarker signs of disease progression 
compared with biomarker-negative individuals.

With the advent of therapeutics with potential to slow Alzheimer's disease 
progression the necessity of understanding the diagnostic value of plasma 
biomarkers is critical, not only for understanding the etiology and progression 
of Alzheimer's disease, but also for access and response to potentially disease 
modifying therapeutic agents. Multiple studies are currently assessing the 
sensitivity and specificity of plasma biomarkers in large cohorts such as the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. This study uses machine learning to 
predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment using plasma biomarkers 
in conjunction with well-established cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers 
of disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
have identified several risk loci, but many remain unknown. Cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers may aid in gene discovery and we previously demonstrated that 
six CSF biomarkers (β-amyloid, total/phosphorylated tau, NfL, YKL-40, and 
neurogranin) cluster into five principal components (PC), each representing 
statistically independent biological processes. Here, we aimed to (1) identify 
common genetic variants associated with these CSF profiles, (2) assess the role 
of associated variants in AD pathophysiology, and (3) explore potential sex 
differences.
METHODS: We performed GWAS for each of the five biomarker PCs in two 
multi-center studies (EMIF-AD and ADNI). In total, 973 participants (n = 205 
controls, n = 546 mild cognitive impairment, n = 222 AD) were analyzed for 
7,433,949 common SNPs and 19,511 protein-coding genes. Structural equation 
models tested whether biomarker PCs mediate genetic risk effects on AD, and 
stratified and interaction models probed for sex-specific effects.
RESULTS: Five loci showed genome-wide significant association with CSF profiles, 
two were novel (rs145791381 [inflammation] and GRIN2D [synaptic functioning]) 
and three were previously described (APOE, TMEM106B, and CHI3L1). Follow-up 
analyses of the two novel signals in independent datasets only supported the 
GRIN2D locus, which contains several functionally interesting candidate genes. 
Mediation tests indicated that variants in APOE are associated with AD status 
via processes related to amyloid and tau pathology, while markers in TMEM106B 
and CHI3L1 are associated with AD only via neuronal injury/inflammation. 
Additionally, seven loci showed sex-specific associations with AD biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pathway and sex-specific analyses can 
improve our understanding of AD genetics and may contribute to precision 
medicine.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is featured by the extracellular 
accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary 
tangles in the brain. We studied whether Aβ and tau accumulation are 
independently associated with future cognitive decline in the AD continuum.
METHODS: Data were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) public database. A total of 1272 participants were selected based on the 
availability of Aβ-PET and CSF tau at baseline and of those 777 participants 
with follow-up visits.
RESULTS: We found that Aβ-PET and CSF tau pathology were related to cognitive 
decline across the AD clinical spectrum, both as potential predictors for 
dementia progression. Among them, Aβ-PET (A + T- subjects) is an independent 
reliable predictor of longitudinal cognitive decline in terms of ADAS-13, 
ADNI-MEM, and MMSE scores rather than tau pathology (A - T+ subjects), 
indicating tau accumulation is not closely correlated with future cognitive 
impairment without being driven by Aβ deposition. Of note, a high percentage of 
APOE ε4 carriers with Aβ pathology (A+) develop poor memory and learning 
capacity. Interestingly, this condition is not recurrence in terms of the 
ADNI-MEM domain when adding APOE ε4 status. Finally, the levels of Aβ-PET SUVR 
related to glucose hypometabolism more strongly in subjects with A + T- than 
A - T+ both happen at baseline and longitudinal changes.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Aβ-PET alone without tau pathology (A + T-) measure 
is an independent reliable predictor of longitudinal cognitive decline but may 
nonetheless forecast different status of dementia progression. However, tau 
accumulation alone without Aβ pathology background (A - T+) was not enough to be 
an independent predictor of cognitive worsening.

IMPORTANCE: Preventive trials of anti-amyloid agents might preferably recruit 
persons showing earliest biologically relevant β-amyloid (Aβ) binding on 
positron emission tomography (PET).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the timing at which Aβ-PET binding starts showing 
associations with other markers of Alzheimer disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal multicentric cohort study 
included 3 independent cohorts: Presymptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or 
Novel Treatments for Alzheimer Disease (PREVENT-AD) (data collected from 
2012-2020), Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (data collected 
from 2005-2019), and Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) (data collected from 
2011-2019). In a 3-tiered categorization of Aβ-PET binding spatial extent, 
individuals were assigned as having widespread Aβ deposition if they showed 
positive signal throughout a designated set of brain regions prone to early Aβ 
accumulation. Those with binding in some but not all were categorized as having 
regional deposition, while those who failed to show any criterion Aβ signal were 
considered Aβ-negative. All participants who were cognitively unimpaired at 
their first Aβ PET scan.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetics, 
tau-PET burden, and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: A total of 817 participants were included, including 129 from the 
PREVENT-AD cohort (mean [SD] age, 63.5 [4.7] years; 33 [26%] male; 126 [98%] 
White), 400 from ADNI (mean [SD] age, 73.6 [5.8] years; 190 [47%] male; 10 [5%] 
Hispanic, 338 [91%] White), and 288 from HABS (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [6.2] years; 
117 [40%] male; 234 [81%] White). Compared with Aβ-negative persons, those with 
regional Aβ binding showed proportionately more APOE ε4 carriers (18 [64%] vs 22 
[27%] in PREVENT-AD and 34 [31%] vs 38 [19%] in ADNI), reduced CSF Aβ1-42 levels 
(F = 24 and 71), and greater longitudinal Aβ-PET accumulation (significant 
β = 0.019 to 0.056). Participants with widespread amyloid binding further 
exhibited notable cognitive decline (significant β = -0.014 to -0.08), greater 
CSF phosphorylated tau181 (F = 5 and 27), and tau-PET binding (all F &gt; 7.55). 
Using each cohort's specified dichotomous threshold for Aβ positivity or a 
visual read classification, most participants (56% to 100%, depending on 
classification method and cohort) with regional Aβ would have been classified 
Aβ-negative.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Regional Aβ binding appears to be biologically 
relevant and participants at this stage remain relatively free from CSF 
phosphorylated tau181, tau-PET binding, and related cognitive decline, making 
them ideal targets for anti-amyloid agents. Most of these individuals would be 
classified as negative based on classical thresholds of Aβ positivity.

Erratum in
    Alzheimers Res Ther. 2024 Jul 10;16(1):158. doi: 10.1186/s13195-024-01514-8.

BACKGROUND: Polygenic effects have been proposed to account for some disease 
phenotypes; these effects are calculated as a polygenic risk score (PRS). This 
score is correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related phenotypes, such as 
biomarker abnormalities and brain atrophy, and is associated with conversion 
from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. However, the AD PRS has been 
examined mainly in Europeans, and owing to differences in genetic structure and 
lifestyle, it is unclear whether the same relationships between the PRS and 
AD-related phenotypes exist in non-European populations. In this study, we 
calculated and evaluated the AD PRS in Japanese individuals using genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) statistics from Europeans.
METHODS: In this study, we calculated the AD PRS in 504 Japanese participants 
(145 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, 220 participants with late mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 139 patients with mild AD dementia) enrolled in 
the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) project. In 
order to evaluate the clinical value of this score, we (1) determined the 
polygenic effects on AD in the J-ADNI and validated it using two independent 
cohorts (a Japanese neuropathology (NP) cohort (n = 565) and the North American 
ADNI (NA-ADNI) cohort (n = 617)), (2) examined the AD-related phenotypes 
associated with the PRS, and (3) tested whether the PRS helps predict the 
conversion of MCI to AD.
RESULTS: The PRS using 131 SNPs had an effect independent of APOE. The PRS 
differentiated between CU participants and AD patients with an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 0.755 when combined with the APOE variants. Similar AUC was 
obtained when PRS calculated by the NP and NA-ADNI cohorts was applied. In MCI 
patients, the PRS was associated with cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated-tau 
levels (β estimate = 0.235, p value = 0.026). MCI with a high PRS showed a 
significantly increased conversion to AD in APOE ε4 noncarriers with a hazard 
rate of 2.22. In addition, we also developed a PRS model adjusted for LD and 
observed similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the AD PRS is useful in the Japanese population, 
whose genetic structure is different from that of the European population. These 
findings suggest that the polygenicity of AD is partially common across ethnic 
differences.

IMPORTANCE: An increased tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal in the 
medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been observed in older individuals in the absence 
of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Little is known about the longitudinal course of 
this condition, and its association with Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To study the pathologic and clinical course of older individuals with 
PET-evidenced MTL tau deposition (TMTL+) in the absence of Aβ pathology (A-), 
and the association of this condition with the AD continuum.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicentric, observational, longitudinal 
cohort study was conducted using pooled data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS), and the 
AVID-A05 study, collected between July 2, 2015, and August 23, 2021. 
Participants in the ADNI, HABS, and AVID-A05 studies (N = 1093) with varying 
degrees of cognitive performance were deemed eligible if they had available tau 
PET, Aβ PET, and magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. Of these, 128 
participants did not meet inclusion criteria based on Aβ PET and tau PET 
biomarker profiles (A+ TMTL-).
EXPOSURES: Tau and Aβ PET, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers, and cognitive assessments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional and longitudinal measures for tau 
and Aβ PET, cortical atrophy, cognitive scores, and core AD cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 p-tau181 available 
in a subset).
RESULTS: Among the 965 individuals included in the study, 503 were women (52.1%) 
and the mean (SD) age was 73.9 (8.1) years. A total of 51% of A- individuals and 
78% of A+ participants had increased tau PET signal in the entorhinal cortex 
(TMTL+) compared with healthy younger (aged <39 years) controls. Compared with 
A- TMTL-, A- TMTL+ participants showed statistically significant, albeit 
moderate, longitudinal (mean [SD], 1.83 [0.84] years) tau PET increases that 
were largely limited to the temporal lobe, whereas those with A+ TMTL+ showed 
faster and more cortically widespread tau PET increases. In contrast to 
participants with A+ TMTL+, those with A- TMTL+ did not show any noticeable Aβ 
accumulation over follow-up (mean [SD], 2.36 [0.76] years). Complementary 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed longitudinal p-tau181 increases in A- 
TMTL+ in the absence of increased Aβ accumulation. Participants with A- TMTL+ 
had accelerated MTL atrophy, whereas those with A+ TMTL+ showed accelerated 
atrophy in widespread temporoparietal brain regions. Increased MTL tau PET 
uptake in A- individuals was associated with cognitive decline, but at a 
significantly slower rate compared with A+ TMTL+.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, individuals with A- TMTL+ exhibited 
progressive tau accumulation and neurodegeneration, but these processes were 
comparably slow, remained largely restricted to the MTL, were associated with 
only subtle changes in global cognitive performance, and were not accompanied by 
detectable accumulation of Aβ biomarkers. These data suggest that individuals 
with A- TMTL+ are not on a pathologic trajectory toward AD.

BACKGROUND: Leveraging Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarkers and 
longitudinal cognitive data may allow us to establish evidence of cognitive 
resilience (CR) to AD pathology in-vivo. Here, we applied latent class mixture 
modeling, adjusting for sex, baseline age, and neuroimaging biomarkers of 
amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration, to a sample of cognitively unimpaired older 
adults to identify longitudinal trajectories of CR.
METHODS: We identified 200 Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) participants (mean 
age = 71.89 years, SD = 9.41 years, 59% women) who were cognitively unimpaired 
at baseline with 2 or more timepoints of cognitive assessment following a single 
amyloid-PET, tau-PET and structural MRI. We examined latent class mixture models 
with longitudinal cognition as the dependent variable and time from baseline, 
baseline age, sex, neocortical Aβ, entorhinal tau, and adjusted hippocampal 
volume as independent variables. We then examined group differences in 
CR-related factors across the identified subgroups from a favored model. 
Finally, we applied our favored model to a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 160, mean age = 73.9 years, SD = 7.6 years, 
60% women).
RESULTS: The favored model identified 3 latent subgroups, which we labelled as 
Normal (71% of HABS sample), Resilient (22.5%) and Declining (6.5%) subgroups. 
The Resilient subgroup exhibited higher baseline cognitive performance and a 
stable cognitive slope. They were differentiated from other groups by higher 
levels of verbal intelligence and past cognitive activity. In ADNI, this model 
identified a larger Normal subgroup (88.1%), a smaller Resilient subgroup (6.3%) 
and a Declining group (5.6%) with a lower cognitive baseline.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the value of data-driven approaches to 
identify longitudinal CR groups in preclinical AD. With such an approach, we 
identified a CR subgroup who reflected expected characteristics based on 
previous literature, higher levels of verbal intelligence and past cognitive 
activity.

Females are disproportionately affected by dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. 
Despite a similar amyloid-β (Aβ) load, a higher load of neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs) is seen in females than males. Previous literature has proposed that Aβ 
and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) synergism accelerates tau tangle formation, yet 
the effect of biological sex in this process has been overlooked. In this 
observational study, we examined longitudinal neuroimaging data from the TRIAD 
and ADNI cohorts from Canada and USA, respectively. We assessed 457 participants 
across the clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease. All participants underwent 
baseline multimodal imaging assessment, including MRI and PET, with radioligands 
targeting Aβ plaques and tau tangles, respectively. CSF data were also 
collected. Follow-up imaging assessments were conducted at 1- and 2-year 
intervals for the TRIAD cohort and 1-, 2- and 4-year intervals for the ADNI 
cohort. The upstream pathological events contributing to faster tau progression 
in females were investigated-specifically, whether the contribution of Aβ and 
p-tau synergism to accelerated tau tangle formation is modulated by biological 
sex. We hypothesized that cortical Aβ predisposes tau phosphorylation and tangle 
accumulation in a sex-specific manner. Findings revealed that Aβ-positive 
females presented higher CSF p-tau181 concentrations compared with Aβ-positive 
males in both the TRIAD (P = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.51) and ADNI (P = 0.027, 
Cohen's d = 0.41) cohorts. In addition, Aβ-positive females presented faster NFT 
accumulation compared with their male counterparts (TRIAD: P = 0.026, Cohen's d 
= 0.52; ADNI: P = 0.049, Cohen's d = 1.14). Finally, the triple interaction 
between female sex, Aβ and CSF p-tau181 was revealed as a significant predictor 
of accelerated tau accumulation at the 2-year follow-up visit (Braak I: P = 
0.0067, t = 2.81; Braak III: P = 0.017, t = 2.45; Braak IV: P = 0.002, t = 3.17; 
Braak V: P = 0.006, t = 2.88; Braak VI: P = 0.0049, t = 2.93). Overall, we 
report sex-specific modulation of cortical Aβ in tau phosphorylation, 
consequently facilitating faster NFT progression in female individuals over 
time. This presents important clinical implications and suggests that early 
intervention that targets Aβ plaques and tau phosphorylation may be a promising 
therapeutic strategy in females to prevent the further accumulation and spread 
of tau aggregates.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: β-amyloid (Aβ) staging models assume a single 
spatial-temporal progression of amyloid accumulation. We assessed evidence for 
Aβ accumulation subtypes by applying the data-driven Subtype and Stage Inference 
(SuStaIn) model to amyloid-PET data.
METHODS: Amyloid-PET data of 3,010 participants were pooled from 6 cohorts 
(ALFA+, EMIF-AD, ABIDE, OASIS, and ADNI). Standardized uptake value ratios were 
calculated for 17 regions. We applied the SuStaIn algorithm to identify 
consistent subtypes in the pooled dataset based on the cross-validation 
information criterion and the most probable subtype/stage classification per 
scan. The effects of demographics and risk factors on subtype assignment were 
assessed using multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Participants were mostly cognitively unimpaired (n = 1890 [62.8%]), had 
a mean age of 68.72 (SD 9.1) years, 42.1% were APOE ε4 carriers, and 51.8% were 
female. A 1-subtype model recovered the traditional amyloid accumulation 
trajectory, but SuStaIn identified 3 optimal subtypes, referred to as frontal, 
parietal, and occipital based on the first regions to show abnormality. Of the 
788 (26.2%) with strong subtype assignment (>50% probability), the majority was 
assigned to frontal (n = 415 [52.5%]), followed by parietal (n = 199 [25.3%]) 
and occipital subtypes (n = 175 [22.2%]). Significant differences across 
subtypes included distinct proportions of APOE ε4 carriers (frontal 61.8%, 
parietal 57.1%, occipital 49.4%), participants with dementia (frontal 19.7%, 
parietal 19.1%, occipital 31.0%), and lower age for the parietal subtype 
(frontal/occipital 72.1 years, parietal 69.3 years). Higher amyloid (Centiloid) 
and CSF p-tau burden was observed for the frontal subtype; parietal and 
occipital subtypes did not differ. At follow-up, most participants (81.1%) 
maintained baseline subtype assignment and 25.6% progressed to a later stage.
DISCUSSION: Whereas a 1-trajectory model recovers the established pattern of 
amyloid accumulation, SuStaIn determined that 3 subtypes were optimal, showing 
distinct associations with Alzheimer disease risk factors. Further analyses to 
determine clinical utility are warranted.

Spatial association between distributed β-amyloid and tau varies with cognition.

Carbonell F, McNicoll C, Zijdenbos AP, Bedell BJ; Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative.

Several PET studies have explored the relationship between β-amyloid load and 
tau uptake at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Most of 
these studies have focused on the linear relationship between β-amyloid and tau 
at the local level and their synergistic effect on different AD biomarkers. We 
hypothesize that patterns of spatial association between β-amyloid and tau might 
be uncovered using alternative association metrics that account for linear as 
well as more complex, possible nonlinear dependencies. In the present study, we 
propose a new Canonical Distance Correlation Analysis (CDCA) to generate 
distinctive spatial patterns of the cross-correlation structure between tau, as 
measured by [18F]flortaucipir PET, and β-amyloid, as measured by 
[18F]florbetapir PET, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) study. We found that the CDCA-based β-amyloid scores were not only 
maximally distance-correlated to tau in cognitively normal (CN) controls and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but also differentiated between low and high 
levels of β-amyloid uptake. The most distinctive spatial association pattern was 
characterized by a spread of β-amyloid covering large areas of the cortex and 
localized tau in the entorhinal cortex. More importantly, this spatial 
dependency varies according to cognition, which cannot be explained by the 
uptake differences in β-amyloid or tau between CN and MCI subjects. Hence, the 
CDCA-based scores might be more accurate than the amyloid or tau SUVR for the 
enrollment in clinical trials of those individuals on the path of cognitive 
deterioration.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the interactive associations between amyloid and 
hypertension on the entorhinal cortex (EC) tau and atrophy and the role of 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a shared mechanism by which amyloid and 
hypertension contribute to EC tau and regional white matter hyperintensities 
(WMHs).
METHODS: We analyzed data from older adults without dementia participating in 
the Add-Tau study (NCT02958670, n = 138) or Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) (n = 523) who had available amyloid-positron emission 
tomography (PET), tau-PET, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and 
T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A subsample in both cohorts had 
available arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI (Add-Tau: n = 78; ADNI: n = 89).
RESULTS: The detrimental effects of hypertension on AD pathology and EC 
thickness were more pronounced in the Add-Tau cohort. Increased amyloid burden 
was associated with decreased occipital gray matter CBF in the ADNI cohort. In 
both cohorts, lower regional gray matter CBF was associated with higher EC tau 
and posterior WMH burden.
DISCUSSION: Reduced cerebral perfusion may be one common mechanism through which 
hypertension and amyloid are related to increased EC tau and WMH volume.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hypertension is associated with increased entorhinal cortex (EC) 
tau, particularly in the presence of amyloid. Decreased cortical cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) is associated with higher regional white matter hyperintensity 
volume. Increasing amyloid burden is associated with decreasing CBF in the 
occipital lobe. MTL CBF and amyloid are synergistically associated with EC tau.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the comparability of cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) cutoffs for Elecsys immunoassays for amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40 or 
Aβ42/phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 and the effects of measurement variability 
when predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related outcomes (i.e., Aβ-positron 
emission tomography [PET] visual read and AD neuropathology).
METHODS: We studied 750 participants (BioFINDER study, Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], and University of California San Francisco 
[UCSF]). Youden's index was used to identify cutoffs and to calculate accuracy 
(Aβ-PET visual read as outcome). Using longitudinal variability in Aβ-negative 
controls, we identified a gray zone around cut-points where the risk of an 
inconsistent predicted outcome was >5%.
RESULTS: For Aβ42/Aβ40, cutoffs across cohorts were <0.059 (BioFINDER), <0.057 
(ADNI), and <0.058 (UCSF). For Aβ42/p-tau181, cutoffs were <41.90 
(BioFINDER), <39.20 (ADNI), and <46.02 (UCSF). Accuracy was ≈90% for both 
Aβ42/Aβ40 and Aβ42/p-tau181 using these cutoffs. Using Aβ-PET as an outcome, 
8.7% of participants fell within a gray zone interval for Aβ42/Aβ40, compared to 
4.5% for Aβ42/p-tau181. Similar findings were observed using a measure of 
overall AD neuropathologic change (7.7% vs. 3.3%). In a subset with CSF and 
plasma Aβ42/40, the number of individuals within the gray zone was ≈1.5 to 3 
times greater when using plasma Aβ42/40.
DISCUSSION: CSF Aβ42/p-tau181 was more robust to the effects of measurement 
variability, suggesting that it may be the preferred Elecsys-based measure in 
clinical practice and trials.

INTRODUCTION: We examined the relations of misfolded alpha synuclein 
(α-synuclein) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in two large independent 
cohorts.
METHODS: We included Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders 
Early and Reliably Two (BioFINDER-2) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) participants (n = 2315, cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive 
impairment, AD dementia) who had cross-sectional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
α-synuclein measurement from seed-amplification assay as well as cross-sectional 
and longitudinal amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau levels (measured in CSF and/or by 
positron emission tomography). All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and 
cognitive status.
RESULTS: Across cohorts, the main biomarker associated with α-synuclein 
positivity at baseline was higher levels of Aβ pathology (all p values ≤ 0.02), 
but not tau. Looking at longitudinal measures of AD biomarkers, α-synuclein 
-positive participants had a statistically significant faster increase of Aβ 
load, although of modest magnitude (1.11 Centiloid/year, p = 0.02), compared to 
α-synuclein -negative participants in BioFINDER-2 but not in ADNI.
DISCUSSION: We showed associations between concurrent misfolded α-synuclein and 
Aβ levels, providing in vivo evidence of links between these two molecular 
disease pathways in humans.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid beta (Aβ), but not tau, was associated with alpha-synuclein 
(α-synuclein) positivity. Such association was consistent across two cohorts, 
beyond the effect of age, sex, and cognitive status. α-synuclein-positive 
participants had a small, statistically significant faster increase in Aβ 
positron emission tomography levels in one of the two cohorts.

Hippocampal morphological change is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, whether hippocampal radiomic features are robust as 
predictors of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia 
and whether these features provide any neurobiological foundation remains 
unclear. The primary aim of this study was to verify whether hippocampal 
radiomic features can serve as robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers 
for AD. Multivariate classifier-based support vector machine (SVM) analysis 
provided individual-level predictions for distinguishing AD patients (n = 261) 
from normal controls (NCs; n = 231) with an accuracy of 88.21% and intersite 
cross-validation. Further analyses of a large, independent the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 1228) reinforced these 
findings. In MCI groups, a systemic analysis demonstrated that the identified 
features were significantly associated with clinical features (e.g., 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, polygenic risk scores, cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ, CSF Tau), and longitudinal changes in cognition ability; more 
importantly, the radiomic features had a consistently altered pattern with 
changes in the MMSE scores over 5 years of follow-up. These comprehensive 
results suggest that hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust 
biomarkers for clinical application in AD/MCI, and further provide evidence for 
predicting whether an MCI subject would convert to AD based on the radiomics of 
the hippocampus. The results of this study are expected to have a substantial 
impact on the early diagnosis of AD/MCI.

Recent evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk variants 
(rs1582763 and rs6591561) of the MS4A locus are genome-wide significant 
regulators of soluble TREM2 levels such that the minor allele of the protective 
variant (rs1582763) is associated with higher sTREM2 and lower AD risk while the 
minor allele of (rs6591561) relates to lower sTREM2 and higher AD risk. Our 
group previously found that higher sTREM2 relates to higher Aβ40, worse 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity (measured with the CSF/plasma albumin 
ratio), and higher CSF tau, suggesting strong associations with amyloid 
abundance and both BBB and neurodegeneration complicate interpretation. We 
expand on this work by leveraging these common variants as genetic tools to tune 
the interpretation of high CSF sTREM2, and by exploring the potential modifying 
role of these variants on the well-established associations between CSF sTREM2 
as well as TREM2 transcript levels in the brain with AD neuropathology. 
Biomarker analyses leveraged data from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project 
(n = 127, age = 72 ± 6.43) and were replicated in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 399, age = 73 ± 7.39). Autopsy analyses were 
performed leveraging data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and 
Aging Project (n = 577, age = 89 ± 6.46). We found that the protective variant 
rs1582763 attenuated the association between CSF sTREM2 and Aβ40 (β = -0.44, 
p-value = 0.017) and replicated this interaction in ADNI (β = -0.27, p = 0.017). 
We did not observe this same interaction effect between TREM2 mRNA levels and Aβ 
peptides in brain (Aβ total β = -0.14, p = 0.629; Aβ1-38, β = 0.11, p = 0.200). 
In contrast to the effects on Aβ, the minor allele of this same variant seemed 
to enhance the association with blood-brain barrier dysfunction (β = 7.0e-4, 
p = 0.009), suggesting that elevated sTREM2 may carry a much different 
interpretation in carriers vs. non-carriers of this allele. When evaluating the 
risk variant (rs6591561) across datasets, we did not observe a statistically 
significant interaction against any outcome in VMAP and observed opposing 
directions of associations in ADNI and ROS/MAP on Aβ levels. Together, our 
results suggest that the protective effect of rs1582763 may act by decoupling 
the associations between sTREM2 and amyloid abundance, providing important 
mechanistic insight into sTREM2 changes and highlighting the need to incorporate 
genetic context into the analysis of sTREM2 levels, particularly if leveraged as 
a clinical biomarker of disease in the future.

Amyloid-β is thought to facilitate the spread of tau throughout the neocortex in 
Alzheimer's disease, though how this occurs is not well understood. This is 
because of the spatial discordance between amyloid-β, which accumulates in the 
neocortex, and tau, which accumulates in the medial temporal lobe during ageing. 
There is evidence that in some cases amyloid-β-independent tau spreads beyond 
the medial temporal lobe where it may interact with neocortical amyloid-β. This 
suggests that there may be multiple distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of 
Alzheimer's-related protein aggregation, with potentially different demographic 
and genetic risk profiles. We investigated this hypothesis, applying data-driven 
disease progression subtyping models to post-mortem neuropathology and in vivo 
PET-based measures from two large observational studies: the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory 
and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We consistently identified 'amyloid-first' and 
'tau-first' subtypes using cross-sectional information from both studies. In the 
amyloid-first subtype, extensive neocortical amyloid-β precedes the spread of 
tau beyond the medial temporal lobe, while in the tau-first subtype, mild tau 
accumulates in medial temporal and neocortical areas prior to interacting with 
amyloid-β. As expected, we found a higher prevalence of the amyloid-first 
subtype among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele carriers while the tau-first 
subtype was more common among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Within tau-first APOE ε4 
carriers, we found an increased rate of amyloid-β accumulation (via longitudinal 
amyloid PET), suggesting that this rare group may belong within the Alzheimer's 
disease continuum. We also found that tau-first APOE ε4 carriers had several 
fewer years of education than other groups, suggesting a role for modifiable 
risk factors in facilitating amyloid-β-independent tau. Tau-first APOE ε4 
non-carriers, in contrast, recapitulated many of the features of primary 
age-related tauopathy. The rate of longitudinal amyloid-β and tau accumulation 
(both measured via PET) within this group did not differ from normal ageing, 
supporting the distinction of primary age-related tauopathy from Alzheimer's 
disease. We also found reduced longitudinal subtype consistency within tau-first 
APOE ε4 non-carriers, suggesting additional heterogeneity within this group. Our 
findings support the idea that amyloid-β and tau may begin as independent 
processes in spatially disconnected regions, with widespread neocortical tau 
resulting from the local interaction of amyloid-β and tau. The site of this 
interaction may be subtype-dependent: medial temporal lobe in amyloid-first, 
neocortex in tau-first. These insights into the dynamics of amyloid-β and tau 
may inform research and clinical trials that target these pathologies.

BACKGROUND: There are many pathological changes in the brains of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients. For many years, the mainstream view on the pathogenesis 
of AD believes that β-amyloid (Aβ) usually acts independently in addition to 
triggering functions. However, the evidence now accumulating indicates another 
case that these pathological types have synergies. The objective of this study 
was to investigate whether effects of Aβ pathology on cognition were mediated by 
AD pathologies, including tau-related pathology (p-tau), neurodegeneration 
(t-tau, MRI measurements), axonal injury (NFL), synaptic dysfunction 
(neurogranin), and neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40).
METHODS: Three hundred seventy normal controls (CN) and 623 MCI patients from 
the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database were recruited 
in this research. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the 
associations of baseline Aβ with cognitive decline and biomarkers of several 
pathophysiological pathways. Causal mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped 
iterations were conducted to explore the mediation effects of AD pathologies on 
cognition.
RESULTS: Tau-related pathology, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation are 
correlated with the concentration of Aβ, even in CN participants. The results 
show that age, gender, and APOE ε4 carrier status have a moderating influence on 
some of these relationships. There is a stronger association of Aβ with 
biomarkers and cognitive changes in the elderly and females. In CN group, Aβ 
pathology is directly related to poor cognition and has no mediating effect (p 
< 0.05). In mild cognitive impairment, tau-related pathology (26.15% of total 
effect) and neurodegeneration (14.8% to 47.0% of total effect) mediate the 
impact of Aβ on cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, early Aβ accumulation has an independent effect on 
cognitive decline in CN and a tau, neurodegeneration-dependent effect in the 
subsequent cognitive decline in MCI patients.

INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers for the prediction of cognitive decline in patients 
with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and amnestic mild dementia are 
needed for both clinical practice and clinical trials.
METHODS: We evaluated the ability of tau-PET (positron emission tomography), 
cortical atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), baseline cognition, 
apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) status, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels 
of phosphorylated tau-217, neurofilament light (NfL), and amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 
ratio (individually and in combination) to predict cognitive decline over 2 
years in BioFINDER-2 and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: Baseline tau-PET and a composite baseline cognitive score were the 
strongest independent predictors of cognitive decline. Cortical thickness and 
NfL provided some additional information. Using a predictive algorithm to enrich 
patient selection in a theoretical clinical trial led to a significantly lower 
required sample size.
DISCUSSION: Models including baseline tau-PET and cognition consistently 
provided the best prediction of change in cognitive function over 2 years in 
patients with amnestic MCI or mild dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between discordant β-amyloid (Aβ) PET 
and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later.
METHODS: We included 730 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
participants without dementia (282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive 
impairment) with baseline [18F]florbetapir PET and CSF Aβ42 available. Aβ 
CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cutoffs. 
Longitudinal data were available for [18F]florbetapir (Aβ) PET (baseline to 4.3 
± 1.9 years), CSF (p)tau (baseline to 2.0 ± 0.1 years), cognition (baseline to 
4.3 ± 2.0 years), and [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET (measured 5.2 ± 1.2 years 
after baseline to 1.6 ± 0.7 years later). We used linear mixed modeling to study 
the association between Aβ CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or 
using PET. We calculated the proportion of CSF+/PET- participants who during 
follow-up (1) progressed to Aβ CSF+/PET+ or (2) became tau-positive based on 
[18F]flortaucipir PET.
RESULTS: Aβ CSF+/PET+ (n = 318) participants had elevated CSF (p)tau levels and 
worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF+/PET- (n = 80) participants 
were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- (N = 306) group. Five years after 
baseline, [18F]flortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF+/PET- group (1.20 ± 0.13) did 
not differ from CSF-/PET- (1.18 ± 0.08, p = 0.69), but was substantially lower 
than CSF+/PET+ (1.48 ± 0.44, p < 0.001). Of the CSF+/PET- participants, 21/64 
(33%) progressed to Aβ CSF+/PET+, whereas only one (3%, difference p < 0.05) 
became tau-positive based on [18F]flortaucipir PET.
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ load detectable by both CSF and PET seems to precede substantial 
tau deposition. Compared to participants with abnormal Aβ levels on both PET and 
CSF, the CSF+/PET- group has a distinctly better prognosis.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) PET Core has evolved over 
time, beginning with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of a subsample 
of participants with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, adding tracers for 
measurement of β-amyloid, followed by tau tracers. This review examines the 
evolution of the ADNI PET Core, the novel aspects of PET imaging in each stage 
of ADNI, and gives an accounting of PET images available in the ADNI database. 
The ADNI PET Core has been and continues to be a rich resource that provides 
quantitative PET data and preprocessed PET images to the scientific community, 
allowing interrogation of both basic and clinically relevant questions. By 
standardizing methods across different PET scanners and multiple PET tracers, 
the Core has demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale, multi-center PET 
studies. Data managed and disseminated by the PET Core has been critical to 
defining pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and helped to 
drive methods used in modern therapeutic trials. HIGHLIGHTS: The ADNI PET Core 
began with FDG-PET and now includes three amyloid and three tau PET ligands. The 
PET Core has standardized acquisition and analysis of multitracer PET images. 
The ADNI PET Core helped to develop methods that have facilitated clinical 
trials in AD.

The deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides as senile plaques and tau as 
neurofibrillary changes causes the hallmark neuropathological lesions of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are implicated in its pathogenesis and deemed as 
the prime target for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Aβ is produced by 
sequential proteolytic cleavage by β- and γ-secretases. γ-Secretase, harboring 
presenilins (PS) as the catalytic center, forms the C-terminus of Aβ that 
determines its propensity to aggregate; missense mutations in PS genes cause 
familial AD by altering the preferred γ-secretase cleavage sites to increase the 
production of pathogenic Aβ42 species. Numerous DMTs for AD have been tested in 
clinical trials, some of which met the clinical endpoints, whereas others, 
especially those conducted in dementia stages, have failed, underscoring the 
needs for early intervention. Notably, positive outcomes of recent trials for 
anti-Aβ antibody drugs have depended largely on molecular imaging and fluid 
biomarkers, underscoring the needs of markers that surrogate the clinical and 
pathophysiological progression of AD. Longitudinal observational studies as 
represented by the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in North America, as well 
as the Japanese ADNI (J-ADNI), have contributed greatly toward the goal of very 
early treatment at the prodromal and preclinical AD stages by delineating the 
early natural course of AD and facilitating the development of biomarkers. It 
has been demonstrated that the clinical and biomarker profiles of prodromal AD 
in J-ADNI were remarkably similar to those in the North American ADNI, 
supporting the harmonization of global clinical trials. These clinical studies 
in Japan, accelerated by the development and implementation of biomarkers, will 
pave the way toward the development of AD therapies targeting its very early 
stages.

We examined the characteristics of individuals with biomarker evidence of 
tauopathy but without β-amyloid (Aβ) (A-T+) in relation to individuals with 
(A+T+) and without (A-T-) evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We included 561 
participants with Aβ and tau PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). We compared A-T- (n = 316), A-T+ (n = 63), and A+T+ (n = 182) 
individuals on demographics, amyloid, tau, hippocampal volumes, and cognition. 
A-T+ individuals were low on apolipoprotein E ɛ4 prevalence (17%) and had no 
evidence of subtly elevated brain Aβ within the negative range. The severity of 
tau deposition, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive dysfunction in the A-T+ group 
was intermediate between A-T- and A+T+ (all p < 0.001). Tau uptake patterns in 
A-T+ individuals were heterogeneous, but approximately 29% showed tau deposition 
in the medial temporal lobe only, consistent with primary age-related tauopathy 
and an additional 32% showed a pattern consistent with AD. A-T+ individuals also 
share other features that are characteristic of AD such as cognitive impairment 
and neurodegeneration, but this group is heterogeneous and likely reflects more 
than one disorder.

Four-repeat (4R) tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by 
cerebral accumulation of 4R tau pathology. The most prominent 4R tauopathies are 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration characterized 
by subcortical tau accumulation and cortical neuronal dysfunction, as shown by 
PET-assessed hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism. Yet, there is a spatial 
mismatch between subcortical tau deposition patterns and cortical neuronal 
dysfunction, and it is unclear how these two pathological brain changes are 
interrelated. Here, we hypothesized that subcortical tau pathology induces 
remote neuronal dysfunction in functionally connected cortical regions to test a 
pathophysiological model that mechanistically links subcortical tau accumulation 
to cortical neuronal dysfunction in 4R tauopathies. We included 51 Aβ-negative 
patients with clinically diagnosed PSP variants (n = 26) or corticobasal 
syndrome (n = 25) who underwent structural MRI and 18F-PI-2620 tau-PET. 
18F-PI-2620 tau-PET was recorded using a dynamic one-stop-shop acquisition 
protocol to determine an early 0.5-2.5 min post tracer-injection perfusion 
window for assessing cortical neuronal dysfunction, as well as a 20-40 min post 
tracer-injection window to determine 4R-tau load. Perfusion-PET (i.e. early 
window) was assessed in 200 cortical regions, and tau-PET was assessed in 32 
subcortical regions of established functional brain atlases. We determined tau 
epicentres as subcortical regions with the highest 18F-PI-2620 tau-PET signal 
and assessed the connectivity of tau epicentres to cortical regions of interest 
using a resting-state functional MRI-based functional connectivity template 
derived from 69 healthy elderly controls from the ADNI cohort. Using linear 
regression, we assessed whether: (i) higher subcortical tau-PET was associated 
with reduced cortical perfusion; and (ii) cortical perfusion reductions were 
observed preferentially in regions closely connected to subcortical tau 
epicentres. As hypothesized, higher subcortical tau-PET was associated with 
overall lower cortical perfusion, which remained consistent when controlling for 
cortical tau-PET. Using group-average and subject-level PET data, we found that 
the seed-based connectivity pattern of subcortical tau epicentres aligned with 
cortical perfusion patterns, where cortical regions that were more closely 
connected to the tau epicentre showed lower perfusion. Together, subcortical 
tau-accumulation is associated with remote perfusion reductions indicative of 
neuronal dysfunction in functionally connected cortical regions in 
4R-tauopathies. This suggests that subcortical tau pathology may induce cortical 
dysfunction, which may contribute to clinical disease manifestation and clinical 
heterogeneity.

Insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and their receptors are highly 
expressed in the adult hippocampus. Thus, disturbances in the insulin-IGF 
signalling pathway may account for the selective vulnerability of the 
hippocampus to nascent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In the present study, 
we examined the predominant IGF-binding protein in the CSF, IGFBP2. CSF was 
collected from 109 asymptomatic members of the parental history-positive 
PREVENT-AD cohort. CSF levels of IGFBP2, core AD and synaptic biomarkers were 
measured using proximity extension assay, ELISA and mass spectrometry. Cortical 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition were examined using 18F-NAV4694 and 
flortaucipir. Cognitive assessments were performed during up to 8 years of 
follow-up, using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological 
Status. T1-weighted structural MRI scans were acquired, and neuroimaging 
analyses were performed on pre-specified temporal and parietal brain regions. 
Next, in an independent cohort, we allocated 241 dementia-free ADNI-1 
participants into four stages of AD progression based on the biomarkers CSF Aβ42 
and total-tau (t-tau). In this analysis, differences in CSF and plasma IGFBP2 
levels were examined across the pathological stages. Finally, IGFBP2 mRNA and 
protein levels were examined in the frontal cortex of 55 autopsy-confirmed AD 
and 31 control brains from the Quebec Founder Population (QFP) cohort, a unique 
population isolated from Eastern Canada. CSF IGFBP2 progressively increased over 
5 years in asymptomatic PREVENT-AD participants. Baseline CSF IGFBP2 was 
positively correlated with CSF AD biomarkers and synaptic biomarkers, and 
negatively correlated with longitudinal changes in delayed memory (P = 0.024) 
and visuospatial abilities (P = 0.019). CSF IGFBP2 was negatively correlated at 
a trend-level with entorhinal cortex volume (P = 0.082) and cortical thickness 
in the piriform (P = 0.039), inferior temporal (P = 0.008), middle temporal (P = 
0.014) and precuneus (P = 0.033) regions. In ADNI-1, CSF (P = 0.009) and plasma 
(P = 0.001) IGFBP2 were significantly elevated in Stage 2 [CSF Aβ(+)/t-tau(+)]. 
In survival analyses in ADNI-1, elevated plasma IGFBP2 was associated with a 
greater rate of AD conversion (hazard ratio = 1.62, P = 0.021). In the QFP 
cohort, IGFBP2 mRNA was reduced (P = 0.049); however, IGFBP2 protein levels did 
not differ in the frontal cortex of autopsy-confirmed AD brains (P = 0.462). 
Nascent AD pathology may induce an upregulation in IGFBP2 in asymptomatic 
individuals. CSF and plasma IGFBP2 may be valuable markers for identifying CSF 
Aβ(+)/t-tau(+) individuals and those with a greater risk of AD conversion.

BACKGROUND: APOE variants are strongly associated with abnormal amyloid 
aggregation and additional direct effects of APOE on tau aggregation are 
reported in animal and human cell models. The degree to which these effects are 
present in humans when individuals are clinically unimpaired (CU) but have 
abnormal amyloid (Aβ+) remains unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed data from CU individuals in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in 
Asymptomatic AD (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and 
Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies. Amyloid PET data were available for 4486 
participants (3163 Aβ-, 1323 Aβ+) and tau PET data were available for a subset 
of 447 participants (55 Aβ-, 392 Aβ+). Linear models examined APOE (number of e2 
and e4 alleles) associations with global amyloid and regional tau burden in 
medial temporal lobe (entorhinal, amygdala) and early neocortical regions 
(inferior temporal, inferior parietal, precuneus). Consistency of APOE4 effects 
on regional tau were examined in 220 Aβ + CU and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: APOE2 and APOE4 were associated with lower and higher amyloid 
positivity rates, respectively. Among Aβ+ CU, e2 and e4 were associated with 
reduced (-12 centiloids per allele) and greater (+15 centiloids per allele) 
continuous amyloid burden, respectively. APOE2 was associated with reduced 
regional tau in all regions (-0.05 to -0.09 SUVR per allele), whereas APOE4 was 
associated with greater regional tau (+0.02 to +0.07 SUVR per allele). APOE 
differences were confirmed by contrasting e3/e3 with e2/e3 and e3/e4. Mediation 
analyses among Aβ+ s showed that direct effects of e2 on regional tau were 
present in medial temporal lobe and early neocortical regions, beyond an 
indirect pathway mediated by continuous amyloid burden. For e4, direct effects 
on regional tau were only significant in medial temporal lobe. The magnitude of 
protective e2 effects on regional tau was consistent across brain regions, 
whereas detrimental e4 effects were greatest in medial temporal lobe. APOE4 
patterns were confirmed in Aβ+ ADNI participants.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE influences early regional tau PET burden, above and beyond 
effects related to cross-sectional amyloid PET burden. Therapeutic strategies 
targeting underlying mechanisms related to APOE may modify tau accumulation 
among Aβ+ individuals.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through various mechanisms. Bile acids 
(BAs), which are the final byproducts of cholesterol metabolism created through 
both the human body and gut microbiome, appear to be influenced by gut 
microbiota and may impact AD pathological characteristics such as the 
accumulation of tau and amyloid-β. We aimed to investigate the associations 
between various serum BAs and CSF biomarkers (including Aβ, total tau, and 
p-tau). Additionally, we sought to examine the longitudinal changes in brain Aβ 
and tau through PET imaging in relation to BAs profile.
METHODS: The data of 828 subjects including 491 diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), 119 patients diagnosed with AD, and 267 cognitively normal 
(CN) participants were obtained from ADNI. The baseline and longitudinal [18F] 
florbetapir and [18F] flortaucipir PET standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) 
measures were obtained to assess the accumulation of tau and Aβ. Moreover, 
baseline levels of serum BAs and CSF Aβ1-42, tau, and p-tau were used.
RESULTS: After FDR correction we observed that five BAs level and relevant 
calculated ratios were associated with CSF p-tau and tau, three with CSF Aβ1-42. 
Furthermore, three BAs level and relevant calculated ratios were associated with 
the tau-PET rate of change, and two with the Aβ rate of change.
CONCLUSION: The findings from our study suggest a correlation between altered 
profiles of BAs and CSF and imaging biomarkers associated with AD. These results 
provide supporting evidence for the link between the gut microbiome and the 
pathological features of AD.

BACKGROUND: Dementia preventive interventions targeting multiple modifiable risk 
factors are a promising approach. However, the impact of modifiable risk factors 
in the presence of beta-amyloid or phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) pathology is 
unclear.
METHODS: The objective of the study was to examine the role of modifiable risk 
factors (vascular factors, depression, and smoking) in the progression to mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia among 434 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 
611 individuals with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Vascular risk factors were summarized with the Cardiovascular 
Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) score, dichotomized into higher versus 
lower risk. Depression and smoking (yes/no) were categorised according to 
medical history or current symptoms. Analyses were stratified by beta-amyloid 
negative (A-) and positive (A +), p-tau negative (T-) and positive (T +), or 
beta-amyloid and p-tau negative (A-T-) and positive (A + T +) biomarker status. 
Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for age, sex, education, baseline 
MMSE score, baseline hippocampal volume and ApoE4 carrier status.
RESULTS: Higher CAIDE score was associated with increased risk of progression to 
all-cause dementia in most MCI subgroups: adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) [95% CI] 
were 3.1 [1.43; 6.53] in the A- subgroup, 1.7 [1.20-2.27] in T + , 2.6 
[1.06-6.59] in A-T-, and 1.6 [1.15-2.22] in the A + T + subgroup. Smoking 
(yes/no) was associated with increased dementia aHR in the A + MCI subgroup: 1.6 
[1.07-2.34]. Depression increased dementia aHR in the T + MCI subgroup: 1.5 
[1.06-2.02]. No significant associations were found in the CU biomarker 
subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Addressing modifiable risk factors carries an important potential 
for reducing the risk of dementia even after the onset of Alzheimer's pathology. 
Knowledge of biomarker status can further optimize prevention strategies.

INTRODUCTION: We investigate the role of osteopontin (OPN) in participants with 
Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
in AD brains.
METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) OPN, AD, and synaptic biomarker levels were 
measured in 109 cognitively unimpaired (CU), parental-history positive 
Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer's 
Disease (PREVENT-AD) participants, and in 167 CU and 399 participants with MCI 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. OPN levels 
were examined as a function of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau positivity. Survival 
analyses investigated the link between OPN and rate of conversion to AD.
RESULTS: In PREVENT-AD, CSF OPN was positively correlated with synaptic 
biomarkers. In PREVENT-AD and ADNI, OPN was elevated in CSF Aβ42/40(+)/total 
tau(+) and CSF Aβ42/40(+)/phosphorylated tau181(+) individuals. In ADNI, OPN was 
increased in Aβ(+) positron emission tomography (PET) and tau(+) PET 
individuals, and associated with an accelerated rate of conversion to AD. OPN 
was elevated in autopsy-confirmed AD brains.
DISCUSSION: Strong associations between CSF OPN and key markers of AD 
pathophysiology suggest a significant role for OPN in tau neurobiology, 
particularly in the early stages of the disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: In the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel 
Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease cohort, we discovered that cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) osteopontin (OPN) levels can indicate early synaptic dysfunction, 
tau deposition, and neuronal loss in cognitively unimpaired elderly with a 
parental history. CSF OPN is elevated in amyloid beta(+) positron emission 
tomography (PET) and tau(+) PET individuals. Elevated CSF OPN is associated with 
an accelerated rate of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated CSF OPN 
is associated with an accelerated rate of cognitive decline on the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale 13, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes. 
OPN mRNA and protein levels are significantly upregulated in the frontal cortex 
of autopsy-confirmed AD brains.

The correlations between apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE4) status and regional 
amyloid, tau, and cortical thickness in cognitively normal elderly are not fully 
understood. Our cross-sectional study aimed to compare regional amyloid/tau 
burden, and cortical thickness according to APOE4 carrier status and assess 
correlations between APOE4 and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related biomarker 
burdens. We analyzed 185 cognitively normal participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Participants aged 55-90 with 
normal cognitive function were divided into amyloid ß-positive (Aß+) APOE4 
carriers (group 1, n = 27), Aß+ APOE4 non-carriers (group 2, n = 29), and Aß- 
normal controls (group 0, n = 129). We compared amyloid depositions, tau 
depositions, and cortical thickness among the three groups and assessed 
correlations between APOE4 existence and imaging biomarkers adjusted for age and 
sex. The participants in group 2 were older than those in the other groups. The 
regional amyloid/tau standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) did not differ 
between groups 1 and 2, but the amyloid/tau SUVRs in most regions were 
numerically higher after adjusting for age difference. APOE4 allele had robust 
correlations with increased amyloid burden in the fronto-temporo-parietal 
cortical areas after adjustment for age and sex, but it had weaker and mixed 
correlations with the regional tau burden and did not have significant 
correlation with cortical thickness. We identified that the presence of APOE4 
allele might be more highly associated with amyloid deposition than with other 
AD-related biomarkers such as tau or cortical thickness in cognitively normal 
elderly.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), designed as a 
naturalistic longitudinal study to develop and validate magnetic resonance, 
positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid, and genetic biomarkers for 
use in AD clinical trials, has made many impacts in the decade since its 
inception. The initial 5-year study, ADNI-1, enrolled cognitively normal, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects, and the subsequent studies (ADNI-GO 
and ADNI-2) added early- and late-MCI cohorts. The development of standardized 
methods allowed comparison of data gathered across multiple sites, and these 
data are available to qualified researchers without embargo. ADNI data have been 
used in >600 publications including those describing relationships between 
biomarkers, improved methods for disease diagnosis and the prediction of future 
decline, and identifying novel genetic AD risk loci. ADNI has provided a 
framework for similar initiatives worldwide.

INTRODUCTION: To examine the extent to which positron emission tomography 
(PET)-, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-, and plasma-related 
amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers are associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology at autopsy.
METHODS: A total of 100 participants who respectively underwent antemortem 
biomarker measurements and postmortem neuropathology were included in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We examined the associations 
of PET-, CSF-, and plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers in combinations or alone with 
AD neuropathological changes (ADNC).
RESULTS: PET- and CSF-related A/T/N biomarkers in combination showed high 
concordance with the ADNC stage and alone showed high accuracy in discriminating 
autopsy-confirmed AD. However, the plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers alone showed 
better discriminative performance only when combined with apolipoprotein E 
(APO)E ε4 genotype.
DISCUSSION: This study supports that PET- and CSF-related A/T/N profiles can be 
used to predict accurately the stages of AD neuropathology. For diagnostic 
settings, PET-, CSF-, and plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers are all useful 
diagnostic tools to detect the presence of AD neuropathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: PET- and CSF-related A/T/N biomarkers in combination can accurately 
predict the specific stages of AD neuropathology. PET- and CSF-related A/T/N 
biomarkers alone may serve as a precise diagnostic tool for detecting AD 
neuropathology at autopsy. Plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers may need combined 
risk factors when used as a diagnostic tool. Aβ PET and CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 were 
most consistent with Aβ pathology, while tau PET and CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 were most 
consistent with tau pathology.

Understanding the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the involvement 
of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) related microglia 
activation is crucial for the development of clinical trials targeting microglia 
activation at different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the 
contradictory findings in the literature, it is imperative to investigate the 
longitudinal alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) 
levels as a marker for microglia activation, and its potential association with 
AD biomarkers, in order to address the current knowledge gap. In this study, we 
aimed to assess the longitudinal changes in CSF sTREM2 levels within the 
framework of the A/T/N classification system for AD biomarkers and to explore 
potential associations with AD pathological features, including the presence of 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau aggregates. The baseline and longitudinal (any 
available follow-up visit) CSF sTREM2 levels and processed tau-PET and Aβ-PET 
data of 1001 subjects were recruited from the ADNI database. The participants 
were classified into four groups based on the A/T/N framework: A+ /TN+ , 
A+ /TN- , A- /TN+ , and A- /TN- . Linear regression analyses were conducted to 
assess the relationship between CSF sTREM2 with cognitive performance, tau and 
Aβ-PET adjusting for age, gender, education, and APOE ε4 status. Based on our 
analysis there was a significant difference in baseline and rate of change of 
CSF sTREM2 between ATN groups. While there was no association between baseline 
CSF sTREM2 and cognitive performance (ADNI-mem), we found that the rate of 
change of CSF sTREM2 is significantly associated with cognitive performance in 
the entire cohort but not the ATN groups. We found that the baseline CSF sTREM2 
is significantly associated with baseline tau-PET and Aβ-PET rate of change only 
in the A+ /TN+ group. A significant association was found between the rate of 
change of CSF sTREM2 and the tau- and Aβ-PET rate of change only in the 
A+ /TN- group. Our study suggests that the TREM2-related microglia activation 
and their relations with AD markers and cognitive performance vary the in 
presence or absence of Aβ and tau pathology. Furthermore, our findings revealed 
that a faster increase in the level of CSF sTREM2 might attenuate future Aβ 
plaque formation and tau aggregate accumulation only in the presence of Aβ 
pathology.

OBJECTIVES: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) has been 
suggested as a biomarker for neuron injury, which has been shown to have a 
important diagnostic value in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study 
purpose is investigating potential effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 on CSF 
VILIP-1 levels among the preclinical AD.
METHODS: A total of 110 subjects (including 43 APOE ε4 carriers and 67 ε4 
non-carriers) were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) in the present study.
RESULTS: The results showed that VILIP-1 concentrations in the CSF were 
statistically significantly increased in APOE ε4 carriers in comparison with 
non-carriers. Increased CSF VILIP-1 level was positively associated with the 
concentrations of both CSF-tau and P-tau levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that APOE ε4 might affect CSF VILIP-1 level 
in preclinical AD, indicating an important role of APOE ε4 in neuron injury 
leading to AD.

Previous work has associated polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene 
(rs6347 in DAT1/SLC6A3) and brain derived neurotrophic factor gene (Val66Met in 
BDNF) with atrophy and memory decline. However, it is unclear whether these 
polymorphisms relate to atrophy and cognition through associations with 
Alzheimer's disease pathology. We tested for effects of DAT1 and BDNF 
polymorphisms on cross-sectional and longitudinal β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau 
pathology (measured with positron emission tomography (PET)), hippocampal 
volume, and cognition. We analyzed a sample of cognitively normal older adults 
(cross-sectional n = 321) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). DAT1 and BDNF interacted to predict Aβ-PET, tau-PET, and hippocampal 
atrophy. Carriers of both "non-boptimal" DAT1 C and BDNF Met alleles 
demonstrated greater pathology and atrophy. Our findings provide novel links 
between dopamine and neurotrophic factor genes and AD pathology, consistent with 
previous research implicating these variants in greater risk for developing AD.

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has been considered to be a driving force of 
Alzheimer's disease. However, the association between peripheral immunity and AD 
has been rarely investigated.
METHODS: Separate regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations 
among peripheral immune markers and cognition, neuroimaging, and AD pathology. 
Causal mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the associations with 
cognition were mediated by AD pathology.
RESULTS: A total of 1107 participants (43.9% female, mean age of 73.2 years) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included. 
Regression analyses indicated that elevated neutrophils (NEU) count and 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were associated with lower levels of global 
cognition, memory function (MEM), and executive function (EF), and reduced brain 
metabolism by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as 
well as greater ventricular volume. An elevated NLR was associated with a lower 
level of β-amyloid (Aβ) and a higher level of total tau (T-tau) in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), smaller hippocampal volume (HV), and lesser entorhinal cortex (EC) 
thickness. On the contrary, an elevated level of lymphocytes (LYM) was 
associated with a higher level of Aβ and a lower level of T-tau in CSF, better 
cognition, and less atrophy of brain regions (ventricular volume, HV, and EC 
thickness). The associations of LYM and NLR with cognition were mediated by Aβ 
and T-tau pathology (proportion: 18%~64%; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that two types of peripheral immune cells (NEU and LYM) 
and the ratio of these two cell types (NLR) had associations with cognition, 
neuroimaging, and AD pathology. The associations might be mediated by Aβ and tau 
pathology.

BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of glial cell communication is involved in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the recent study reported that astrocytic 
secreted interleukin-3 (IL-3) participated in astrocyte-microglia crosstalk and 
restricted AD pathology in mice, but the effect of IL-3 on the pathological 
progression of AD in human is still unclear.
METHODS: A total of 311 participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-3, 
soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and AD 
biomarkers were included from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). We assessed the associations of IL-3 with sTREM2 and AD biomarkers at 
baseline, and with cognitive change in longitudinal study. The mediation models 
were used to explore the potential mechanism of how IL-3 affects AD pathology.
RESULTS: We found that CSF IL-3 was significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 and 
CSF AD core biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau, and t-tau) at baseline, and was also 
markedly related to cognitive decline in longitudinal analysis. Moreover, 
mediation analysis revealed that CSF IL-3 modulated the level of CSF sTREM2 and 
contributed to tau pathology (as measured by CSF p-tau/t-tau) and subsequent 
cognitive decline. In addition, Aβ pathology (as measured by CSF Aβ42) affected 
the development of tau pathology partly by modifying the levels of CSF IL-3 and 
CSF sTREM2. Furthermore, the effect of Aβ pathology on cognitive decline was 
partially mediated by the pathway from CSF IL-3 and CSF sTREM2 to tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence to suggest that IL-3 is linked to 
sTREM2 and mediates the correlation between Aβ pathology to tau pathology. It 
indicates that IL-3 may be a major factor in the spreading from Aβ pathology to 
tau pathology to cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Stage 1 of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association's 
proposed Alzheimer's disease continuum is defined as amyloid-β (Aβ) positive but 
cognitively normal. Identifying at-risk individuals before Aβ reaches 
pathological levels could have great benefits for early intervention. Although 
Aβ levels become abnormal long before severe cognitive impairments appear, 
increasing evidence suggests that subtle cognitive changes may begin early, 
potentially before Aβ surpasses the threshold for abnormality. We examined 
whether baseline cognitive performance would predict progression from normal to 
abnormal levels of Aβ.
METHODS: We examined the association of baseline cognitive composites 
(Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) memory factor composite) with progression to Aβ positivity in 
292 nondemented, Aβ-negative ADNI participants. Additional analyses included 
continuous cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels to examine the effects of 
subthreshold pathology.
RESULTS: Forty participants progressed to Aβ positivity during follow-up. Poorer 
baseline performance on both cognitive measures was significantly associated 
with increased odds of progression. More abnormal levels of baseline 
cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau and subthreshold Aβ were associated with 
increased odds of progression to Aβ positivity. Nevertheless, baseline ADNI 
memory factor composite performance predicted progression even after controlling 
for baseline biomarker levels and APOE genotype (Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive 
Composite was trend level). Survival analyses were largely consistent: 
controlling for baseline biomarker levels, baseline Preclinical Alzheimer 
Cognitive Composite still significantly predicted progression time to Aβ 
positivity (ADNI memory factor composite was trend level).
CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of intervening before Aβ reaches pathological 
levels is of obvious benefit. Low-cost, noninvasive cognitive measures can be 
informative for determining who is likely to progress to Aβ positivity, even 
after accounting for baseline subthreshold biomarker levels.

INTRODUCTION: Ethnoracial differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; amyloid beta 
42 [Aβ42], total tau [t-tau], phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and plasma 
(p-tau181, neurofilament light [NfL]) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
incompletely understood.
METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses with and without adjustment for 
covariates comparing baseline CSF (Aβ42, t-tau, p-tau181) and plasma (p-tau181, 
NfL) values in 47 African Americans (AAs) matched to 141 non-Hispanic Whites 
(NHWs) and 43 Latinos (LAs) matched to 129 NHWs from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: Unadjusted comparisons revealed no significant differences in plasma or 
CSF biomarkers between AAs and NHWs. A trend toward a lower CSF t-tau and 
p-tau181 in LAs compared to NHWs was observed, without significant differences 
in plasma biomarkers. After adjusting for covariates, there were no significant 
differences in CSF or plasma biomarkers between AAs and NHWs or between LAs and 
NHWs.
DISCUSSION: Plasma and CSF AD biomarkers may perform similarly across diverse 
populations but future studies in large, diverse cohorts are needed.

BACKGROUND: Recent genetic research identified a protective factor against 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians, a variant called rs3747742-C 
in the TREML2 gene. However, the roles of other TREML2 variants in AD have not 
been fully explored.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a focused analysis of 16 TREML2 variants, examining 
their connection to AD by studying their correlation with cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) proteins, neuroimage, and cognition in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI).
METHODS: A multiple linear regression model was utilized to estimate potential 
associations between TREML2 genotypes and various endophenotypes in the entire 
ADNI sample at baseline, with age, gender, years of education, and APOE ɛ4 
status included as covariates. To examine changes in clinical outcomes over 
time, linear mixed-effects models were employed.
RESULTS: We found that the SNP rs17328707-A was associated with higher ADNI-VS 
scores, smaller ventricles, and larger middle temporal volume at baseline. The 
SNP rs6915083-G was linked to lower CSF t-tau and p-tau levels, and higher CSF 
Aβ levels. The SNP rs9394766-G was associated with a smaller hippocampus and 
larger ventricles at baseline. In longitudinal cohorts, the rs6915083-G SNP was 
associated with changes in ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF scores, as well as the rate of 
hippocampal and middle temporal atrophy.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that TREML2 gene variants have different effects 
on AD. Two variants are protective, while one may be a risk factor. This 
enhances our understanding of AD genetics and could guide future research and 
personalized treatments.

OBJECTIVE: Brain reserve, cognitive reserve, and education are thought to 
protect against late-life cognitive decline, but these variables have not been 
directly compared to one another in the same model, using future cognitive and 
functional decline as outcomes. We sought to determine whether the influence of 
these protective factors on executive function (EF) and daily function decline 
was dependent upon Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology severity, as measured by 
the total tau to beta-amyloid (T-τ/Aβ1-42) ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
METHOD: Participants were 1201 older adult volunteers in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Brain reserve was defined using a 
composite index of structural brain volumes (total brain matter, hippocampus, 
and white matter hyperintensity). Cognitive reserve was defined as the variance 
in episodic memory performance not explained by brain integrity and 
demographics.
RESULTS: At higher levels of T-τ/Aβ1-42, brain and cognitive reserve predicted 
slower decline in EF. Only brain reserve attenuated decline at lower levels of 
T-τ/Aβ1-42. Education had no independent association with cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: These results point to a hierarchy of protection against aging- and 
disease-associated cognitive decline. When pathology is low, only structural 
brain integrity predicts rate of future EF decline. The ability of cognitive 
reserve to predict future EF decline becomes stronger as CSF biomarker evidence 
of AD increases. Although education is typically thought of as a proxy for 
cognitive reserve, it did not show any protective effects on cognition after 
accounting for brain integrity and the residual cognitive reserve index.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain are now widely 
recognized as the defining hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by 
structural atrophy detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. 
One of the particular neurodegenerative regions is the hippocampus to which the 
influence of Aβ/tau on has been one of the research focuses in the AD 
pathophysiological progress. This work proposes a novel framework, Federated 
Morphometry Feature Selection (FMFS) model, to examine subtle aspects of 
hippocampal morphometry that are associated with Aβ/tau burden in the brain, 
measured using positron emission tomography (PET). FMFS is comprised of 
hippocampal surface-based feature calculation, patch-based feature selection, 
federated group LASSO regression, federated screening rule-based stability 
selection, and region of interest (ROI) identification. FMFS was tested on two 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts to understand 
hippocampal alterations that relate to Aβ/tau depositions. Each cohort included 
pairs of MRI and PET for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) subjects. Experimental results demonstrated that FMFS achieves 
an 89× speedup compared to other published state-of-the-art methods under five 
independent hypothetical institutions. In addition, the subiculum and cornu 
ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) were identified as hippocampal subregions where atrophy 
is strongly associated with abnormal Aβ/tau. As potential biomarkers for Aβ/tau 
pathology, the features from the identified ROIs had greater power for 
predicting cognitive assessment and for survival analysis than five other 
imaging biomarkers. All the results indicate that FMFS is an efficient and 
effective tool to reveal associations between Aβ/tau burden and hippocampal 
morphometry.

BACKGROUND: Current AT(N) stratification for Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts 
for complex combinations of amyloid (A), tau proteinopathy (T) and 
neurodegeneration (N) signatures. Understanding the transition between these 
different stages is a major challenge, especially in view of the recent 
development of disease modifying therapy.
METHODS: This is an observational study, CSF levels of Tau, pTau181, pTau217, 
Aβ38/40/42, sAPPα/β, BACE1 and neurogranin were measured in the BALTAZAR cohort 
of cognitively impaired patients and in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Biomarkers levels were related to the AT(N) framework. (A) 
and (T) were defined in BALTAZAR with CSF Aβ42/40 ratio and pTau217 
respectively, and in ADNI with amyloid and tau PET. (N) was defined using total 
CSF tau in both cohorts.
RESULTS: As expected, CSF Aβ42 decreased progressively with the AD continuum 
going from the A-T-N- to the A + T + N + profile. On the other hand, Tau and 
pTau181 increased progressively with the disease. The final transition from 
A + T + N- to A + T + N + led to a sharp increase in Aβ38, Aβ42 and sAPP levels. 
Synaptic CSF biomarkers BACE1 and neurogranin, were lowest in the initial 
A + T-N- stage and increased with T + and N + . CSF pTau181 and total tau were 
closely related in both cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The early transition to an A + phenotype (A + T-N-) primarily 
impacts synaptic function. The appearance of T + and then N + is associated with 
a significant and progressive increase in pathological Alzheimer's disease 
biomarkers. Our main finding is that CSF pTau181 is an indicator of N + rather 
than T + , and that N + is associated with elevated levels of BACE1 protein and 
beta-amyloid peptides. This increase may potentially fuel the amyloid cascade in 
a positive feedback loop. Overall, our data provide further insights into 
understanding the interconnected pathological processes of amyloid, tau, and 
neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are promising to 
be used in clinical settings. The liver is an important degradation organ of the 
body. Whether liver function affects the levels of AD biomarkers needs to be 
studied.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between liver function and the plasma 
levels of AD biomarkers.
METHODS: We conducted an ADNI cohort-based cross-sectional study. Thirteen liver 
function markers commonly used in clinical settings were analyzed: total protein 
(TP), albumin (AL), globulin (GL), AL/GL ratio (A/G), total bilirubin (TB), 
direct bilirubin (DB), indirect bilirubin (IB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT ratio, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the plasma Aβ42 and 
Aβ40 concentrations. Single Molecule array technique was used to measure the 
plasma p-tau181 and NfL concentrations. We used linear regression models to 
analyze the associations between liver function markers and the levels of AD 
plasma biomarkers.
RESULTS: ALP was positively associated with the levels of plasma Aβ42 (β = 0.16, 
P = 0.018) and Aβ40 (β = 0.21, P = 0.004). LDH was positively associated with 
the levels of plasma p-tau181 (β = 0.09, P = 0.022). While NfL was correlated 
with multiple liver function markers, including AL, A/G, ALT, AST/ALT, and LDH.
CONCLUSION: Liver function was associated with the plasma levels of AD 
biomarkers. It needs to consider the potential influence of liver function on 
the reference ranges and the interpretation of results for AD biomarkers before 
clinical use.

Whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of amyloid-positive and 
amyloid-negative patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) are significantly different is still unknown. The purpose of this 
study is to compare the differences in CSF total tau, P-tau and Aβ42 in patients 
with amyloid-positive positron emission tomography (PET) and amyloid-negative 
PET, and to explore related risk factors in cognitive normal (CN), early MCI 
(EMCI), late MCI (LMCI) and AD. 558 participants (140 CN; 233 EMCI; 125 LMCI; 60 
AD) were recruited in this study from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. The associations between CSF biomarkers were assessed by partial 
correlation analysis. The relations between significant variables were 
determined by multinomial logistic regression. Compared with amyloid-positive 
PET patients, patients with amyloid-negative PET had higher CSF Aβ42 and lower 
P-tau in the whole samples. The concentration of Aβ42 in the positive amyloid 
PET was significantly different in different groups, but not the negative 
amyloid PET (CN vs. LMCI; CN vs. AD; EMCI vs. AD, all P < 0.05). When amyloid 
PET was positive, a weak correlation was found between the levels of Aβ42 and 
P-tau only in CN group. However, a moderate degree of correlation between Aβ42 
and P-tau was found in EMCI and LMCI when amyloid PET was negative. After 
covariates adjustment, CSF Aβ42 was signiﬁcantly associated with EMCI [adjusted 
odds ratio (OR) = 0.99, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-1.00, P = 0.02) and 
LMCI (adjusted OR = 0.99, 95 % CI = 0.99-1.00, P = 0.007)] in patients with 
negative amyloid PET, not in patients with positive amyloid PET. Our ﬁndings 
highlight that Aβ42 had strong correlations with other biomarkers and might help 
reduce risk of EMCI or LMCI in patients with amyloid negativity.

BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals before the onset of overt symptoms is key in 
the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVES: Investigate the use of miRNA as early blood-biomarker of cognitive 
decline in older adults.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Two observational cohorts (CHARIOT-PRO, Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)).
PARTICIPANTS: 830 individuals without overt clinical symptoms from CHARIOT-PRO 
and 812 individuals from ADNI.
MEASUREMENTS: qPCR analysis of a prioritised set of 38 miRNAs in the blood of 
individuals from CHARIOT-PRO, followed by a brain-specific functional enrichment 
analysis for the significant miRNAs. In ADNI, genetic association analysis for 
polymorphisms within the significant miRNAs' genes and CSF levels of 
phosphorylated-tau, total-tau, amyloid-β42, soluble-TREM2 and BACE1 activity 
using whole genome sequencing data. Post-hoc analysis using multi-omics 
datasets.
RESULTS: Six miRNAs (hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-144-5p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, 
hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-29c-3p and hsa-miR-363-3p) were downregulated in the 
blood of individuals with low cognitive performance on the Repeatable Battery 
for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The pathway enrichment 
analysis indicated involvement of apoptosis and inflammation, relevant in early 
AD stages. Polymorphisms within genes encoding for hsa-miR-29c-3p and 
hsa-miR-146a-5p were associated with CSF levels of amyloid-β42, soluble-TREM2 
and BACE1 activity, and 21 variants were eQTL for hippocampal MIR29C expression.
CONCLUSIONS: six miRNAs may serve as potential blood biomarker of subclinical 
cognitive deficits in AD. Polymorphisms within these miRNAs suggest a possible 
interplay between the amyloid cascade and microglial activation at preclinical 
stages of AD.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was 
established in 2004 to facilitate the development of effective treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by validating biomarkers for AD clinical trials.
METHODS: We searched for ADNI publications using established methods.
RESULTS: ADNI has (1) developed standardized biomarkers for use in clinical 
trial subject selection and as surrogate outcome measures; (2) standardized 
protocols for use across multiple centers; (3) initiated worldwide ADNI; (4) 
inspired initiatives investigating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic 
stress disorder in military populations, and depression, respectively, as an AD 
risk factor; (5) acted as a data-sharing model; (6) generated data used in over 
600 publications, leading to the identification of novel AD risk alleles, and an 
understanding of the relationship between biomarkers and AD progression; and (7) 
inspired other public-private partnerships developing biomarkers for Parkinson's 
disease and multiple sclerosis.
DISCUSSION: ADNI has made myriad impacts in its first decade. A competitive 
renewal of the project in 2015 would see the use of newly developed tau imaging 
ligands, and the continued development of recruitment strategies and outcome 
measures for clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize biological and technical factors which influence 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker levels, including 
the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, AD diagnosis, Aβ-binding 
proteins, sample processing, and preanalytical handling.
METHODS: CSF was collected from 140 subjects with normal cognition, mild 
cognitive impairment, AD, and non-AD dementia. CSF levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 
(Aβ42), total Tau (t-Tau), and Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-Tau181) 
were analyzed following the standard and modified protocols. CSF levels of apoJ, 
apoE, albumin, and α-synuclein were measured in a subgroup (n = 69), and their 
effects on measured AD biomarker levels were also determined in vitro using 
human CSF samples.
RESULTS: CSF Aβ42 levels measured using the AD Neuro-imaging Initiative (ADNI) 
protocol (which we call suspended Aβ42 or susAβ) were lower than total 
measurable CSF Aβ42 in all groups, and on average represents 57% of the latter. 
Logistic regression analysis showed this proportion (% susAβ) to be directly 
correlated with CSF Aβ42 and apoJ levels, but inversely correlated with CSF 
t-Tau levels. Finally, we showed in vitro that increasing apoE and apoJ levels 
directly increased % susAβ.
CONCLUSION: CSF susAβ levels are influenced by biological and technical factors, 
and may represent a marker of Aβ susceptible to lipoprotein-mediated clearance. 
Clinical trials should include total measurable Aβ42 and susAβ to better inform 
outcomes.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) are 
putative non-amyloid biomarkers indicative of ongoing inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative disease processes. Hence, this study aimed to demonstrate the 
relationship between plasma biomarkers (GFAP and NfL) and 18F-AV-1451 tau PET 
images, and to explore their effects on cognitive function. Ninety-one 
participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database and 20 participants from the Shanghai Action of Prevention Dementia for 
the Elderly (SHAPE) cohort underwent plasma biomarker testing, 18F-AV-1451 tau 
PET scans and cognitive function assessments. Within the ADNI, there were 42 
cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 49 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Similarly, in the SHAPE, we had 10 CN and 10 MCI participants. We calculated the 
standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for the regions of interest (ROIs) in 
the 18F-AV-1451 PET scans. Using plasma biomarkers and regional SUVRs, we 
trained machine learning models to differentiate between MCI and CN subjects 
with ADNI database and validated in SHAPE. Results showed that eight selected 
variables (including left amygdala SUVR, right amygdala SUVR, left entorhinal 
cortex SUVR, age, education, plasma NfL, plasma GFAP, plasma GFAP/ NfL) 
identified by LASSO could differentiate between the MCI and CN individuals, with 
AUC ranging from 0.783 to 0.926. Additionally, cognitive function was negatively 
associated with the plasma biomarkers and tau deposition in amygdala and left 
entorhinal cortex. Increased tau deposition in amygdala and left entorhinal 
cortex were related to increased plasma biomarkers. Moreover, tau pathology 
mediated the effect of plasma biomarkers level on the cognitive decline. The 
present study provides valuable insights into the association among plasma 
markers (GFAP and NfL), regional tau deposition and cognitive function. This 
study reports the mediation effect of brain regions tau deposition on the plasma 
biomarkers level and cognitive function, indicating the significance of tau 
pathology in the MCI patients.

INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in gene expression 
regulation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.
METHODS: We investigated the association between baseline plasma miRNAs and 
central AD biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI; N = 803): amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N). Differentially 
expressed miRNAs and their targets were identified, followed by pathway 
enrichment analysis. Machine learning approaches were applied to investigate the 
role of miRNAs as blood biomarkers.
RESULTS: We identified nine, two, and eight miRNAs significantly associated with 
A/T/N positivity, respectively. We identified 271 genes targeted by 
amyloid-related miRNAs with estrogen signaling receptor-mediated signaling among 
the enriched pathways. Additionally, 220 genes targeted by 
neurodegeneration-related miRNAs showed enrichment in pathways including the 
insulin growth factor 1 pathway. The classification performance of demographic 
information for A/T/N positivity was increased up to 9% with the inclusion of 
miRNAs.
DISCUSSION: Plasma miRNAs were associated with central A/T/N biomarkers, 
highlighting their potential as blood biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: We performed association analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) with 
amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarker positivity. We identified 
dysregulated miRNAs for A/T/N biomarker positivity. We identified Alzheimer's 
disease biomarker-specific/common pathways related to miRNAs. miRNAs improved 
the classification for A/T/N positivity by up to 9%. Our study highlights the 
potential of miRNAs as blood biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: An elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an elevated NLR has also been 
implicated in many other conditions that are risk factors for AD, prompting 
investigation into whether the NLR is directly linked with AD pathology or a 
result of underlying comorbidities. Herein, we explored the relationship between 
the NLR and AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) subjects. Adjusting for sociodemographics, APOE4, and common 
comorbidities, we investigated these associations in two cohorts: the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the M.J. de Leon CSF 
repository at NYU. Specifically, we examined associations between the NLR and 
cross-sectional measures of amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), total tau (t-tau), and 
phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau), as well as the trajectories of these CSF measures 
obtained longitudinally.
RESULTS: A total of 111 ADNI and 190 NYU participants classified as CU with 
available NLR, CSF, and covariate data were included. Compared to NYU, ADNI 
participants were older (73.79 vs. 61.53, p < 0.001), had a higher proportion of 
males (49.5% vs. 36.8%, p = 0.042), higher BMIs (27.94 vs. 25.79, p < 0.001), 
higher prevalence of hypertensive history (47.7% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001), and a 
greater percentage of Aβ-positivity (34.2% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.009). In the ADNI 
cohort, we found cross-sectional associations between the NLR and CSF Aβ42 
(β = -12.193, p = 0.021), but not t-tau or p-tau. In the NYU cohort, we found 
cross-sectional associations between the NLR and CSF t-tau (β = 26.812, 
p = 0.019) and p-tau (β = 3.441, p = 0.015), but not Aβ42. In the NYU cohort 
alone, subjects classified as Aβ + (n = 38) displayed a stronger association 
between the NLR and t-tau (β = 100.476, p = 0.037) compared to Aβ- subjects or 
the non-stratified cohort. In both cohorts, the same associations observed in 
the cross-sectional analyses were observed after incorporating longitudinal CSF 
data.
CONCLUSIONS: We report associations between the NLR and Aβ42 in the older ADNI 
cohort, and between the NLR and t-tau and p-tau in the younger NYU cohort. 
Associations persisted after adjusting for comorbidities, suggesting a direct 
link between the NLR and AD. However, changes in associations between the NLR 
and specific AD biomarkers may occur as part of immunosenescence.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common among military veterans and has been 
associated with an increased risk of dementia. It is unclear if this is due to 
increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other mechanisms. This case 
control study sought evidence for AD, as defined by the 2018 National Institute 
on Aging - Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) research framework, by measuring 
tau, β-amyloid, and glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) 
in veterans with service-related TBI. Seventy male Vietnam war veterans-40 with 
TBI (age 68.0 ± 2.5 years) and 30 controls (age 70.1 ± 5.3 years)-with no prior 
diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment underwent β-amyloid 
(18F-Florbetaben), tau (18F-Flortaucipir), and fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET. 
The TBI cohort included 15 participants with mild, 16 with moderate, and nine 
with severe injury. β-Amyloid level was calculated using the Centiloid (CL) 
method and tau was measured by standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using 
the cerebellar cortex as reference region. Analyses were adjusted for age and 
APOE-e4. The findings were validated in an independent cohort from the 
Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (DOD ADNI) 
study. There were no significant nor trending differences in β-amyloid or tau 
levels or 18F-FDG uptake between the TBI and control groups before and after 
controlling for covariates. The β-amyloid and tau findings were replicated in 
the DOD ADNI validation cohort and persisted when the Australian Imaging 
Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of aging-Veterans study (AIBL-VETS) and DOD ADNI 
cohorts were combined (114 TBI vs. 87 controls in total). In conclusion, no 
increase in the later life accumulation of the neuropathological markers of AD 
in veterans with a remote history of TBI was identified.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive form of dementia that results in problems 
with memory, thinking, and behavior. It often starts with abnormal aggregation 
and deposition of β amyloid and tau, followed by neuronal damage such as atrophy 
of the hippocampi, leading to Alzheimers Disease (AD). The aim of this paper is 
to map the genetic-imaging-clinical pathway for AD in order to delineate the 
genetically-regulated brain changes that drive disease progression based on the 
Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We develop a novel 
two-step approach to delineate the association between high-dimensional 2D 
hippocampal surface exposures and the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) 
cognitive score, while taking into account the ultra-high dimensional clinical 
and genetic covariates at baseline. Analysis results suggest that the radial 
distance of each pixel of both hippocampi is negatively associated with the 
severity of behavioral deficits conditional on observed clinical and genetic 
covariates. These associations are stronger in Cornu Ammonis region 1 (CA1) and 
subiculum subregions compared to Cornu Ammonis region 2 (CA2) and Cornu Ammonis 
region 3 (CA3) subregions. Supplementary materials for this article, including a

OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in subjects with MCI and 
associated with higher risk of progression to AD. The cognitive and 
neuroanatomical correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI have not been 
fully elucidated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the association between 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, regional tau deposition, and 
brain volumes in MCI subjects.
METHODS: A total of 233 MCI and 305 healthy comparisons were selected from the 
ADNI-3 cohort. All the subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological 
assessment, volumetric MR brain scan, and Flortaucipir PET for in vivo 
assessment of regional tau deposition. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
was evaluated by means of the NPI questionnaire. Multivariate analyses of 
variance were used to detect differences in cognitive and imaging markers in MCI 
subjects with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms.
RESULTS: 61.4% MCI subjects showed at least one neuropsychiatric symptom, with 
the most prevalent ones being depression (26.1%), irritability (23.6%), and 
sleep disturbances (23.6%). There was a significant effect of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms on cognitive tests of frontal and executive functions. MCI subjects 
with neuropsychiatric symptoms showed reduced brain volumes in the orbitofrontal 
and posterior cingulate cortices, while no effects were detected on regional tau 
deposition. Posterior cingulate cortex volume was the only predictor of global 
neuropsychiatric burden in this MCI population.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur early in the AD trajectory and are 
mainly related to defects of control executive abilities and to the reduction of 
gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortices. A 
better understanding of the cognitive and neuroanatomical mechanisms of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI could help develop more targeted and 
efficacious treatment alternatives.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological process of amyloid-β, tau deposition, and 
neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin in a preclinical phase, 
while anxiety is associated with an increased risk of AD in preclinical phase.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between anxiety and amyloid-β, tau 
deposition, and neurodegeneration. To test the hypothesis that anxiety could 
predict clinical progression in the elderly without dementia.
METHODS: 1,400 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database were included in the study and were studied over a median period 
of 3 years. In multivariable models, the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations between anxiety and amyloid-β PET, tau PET, and FDG PET SUVRs in 
participants without dementia were explored using Spearman rank correlation, 
logistic regression model, multiple linear regression model, Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves, and Cox proportional hazards model. The association between 
baseline anxiety and clinical progression was also explored.
RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between anxiety and amyloid-β 
deposition (r = 0.11, p = 0.0017) and a negative correlation between anxiety and 
neurodegeneration (r = -0.13, p = 0.00022). MCI participants with anxiety showed 
a faster clinical progression of dementia (HR = 1.56, p = 0.04). Non-anxious 
participants with more amyloid-β deposition or more severe neurodegeneration 
displayed accelerated development into anxiety (HR = 2.352, p < 0.0001; 
HR = 2.254, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Anxiety was associated with amyloid-β deposition and 
neurodegeneration in non-dementia elderly. Anxiety in MCI predicted conversion 
to dementia. Anxiety may play a selective role and prediction of disease 
progression in the early phase of AD.

Alzheimer's disease is biologically heterogeneous, and detailed understanding of 
the processes involved in patients is critical for development of treatments. 
CSF contains hundreds of proteins, with concentrations reflecting ongoing 
(patho)physiological processes. This provides the opportunity to study many 
biological processes at the same time in patients. We studied whether 
Alzheimer's disease biological subtypes can be detected in CSF proteomics using 
the dual clustering technique non-negative matrix factorization. In two 
independent cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI) we found that 705 (77% of 911 tested) 
proteins differed between Alzheimer's disease (defined as having abnormal 
amyloid, n = 425) and controls (defined as having normal CSF amyloid and tau and 
normal cognition, n = 127). Using these proteins for data-driven clustering, we 
identified three robust pathophysiological Alzheimer's disease subtypes within 
each cohort showing (i) hyperplasticity and increased BACE1 levels; (ii) innate 
immune activation; and (iii) blood-brain barrier dysfunction with low BACE1 
levels. In both cohorts, the majority of individuals were labelled as having 
subtype 1 (80, 36% in EMIF-AD MBD; 117, 59% in ADNI), 71 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD 
and 41 (21%) in ADNI were labelled as subtype 2, and 72 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 
39 (20%) individuals in ADNI were labelled as subtype 3. Genetic analyses showed 
that all subtypes had an excess of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (all 
P > 0.01). Additional pathological comparisons that were available for a subset 
in ADNI suggested that subtypes showed similar severity of Alzheimer's disease 
pathology, and did not differ in the frequencies of co-pathologies, providing 
further support that found subtypes truly reflect Alzheimer's disease 
heterogeneity. Compared to controls, all non-demented Alzheimer's disease 
individuals had increased risk of showing clinical progression (all P < 0.01). 
Compared to subtype 1, subtype 2 showed faster clinical progression after 
correcting for age, sex, level of education and tau levels (hazard ratio = 2.5; 
95% confidence interval = 1.2, 5.1; P = 0.01), and subtype 3 at trend level 
(hazard ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.0, 4.4; P = 0.06). Together, 
these results demonstrate the value of CSF proteomics in studying the biological 
heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease patients, and suggest that subtypes may 
require tailored therapy.

BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of cerebral amyloidosis with easily available 
indicators is urgently needed for diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
METHODS: We examined plasma Aβ42, Aβ40, T-tau, P-tau181, and NfL, with APOE 
genotypes, cognitive test scores and key demographics in a large Chinese cohort 
(N = 609, aged 40 to 84 years) covering full AD spectrum. Data-driven integrated 
computational models were developed to predict brain β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology.
RESULTS: Our computational models accurately predict brain Aβ positivity (area 
under the ROC curves (AUC) = 0.94). The results are validated in Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Particularly, the models have the 
highest prediction power (AUC = 0.97) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
participants. Three levels of models are designed with different accuracies and 
complexities. The model which only consists of plasma biomarkers can predict Aβ 
positivity in amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients with AUC = 0.89. Generally the models 
perform better in participants without comorbidities or family histories.
CONCLUSIONS: The innovative integrated models provide opportunity to assess Aβ 
pathology in a non-invasive and cost-effective way, which might facilitate 
AD-drug development, early screening, clinical diagnosis and prognosis 
evaluation.

Plain Language Summary: The numbers of people with Alzheimer’s disease are 
increasing. People with Alzheimer’s disease have changes in the brain as well as 
cognitive impairment, which is when a person has difficulty remembering, 
learning, concentrating, or making decisions. Innovative medicines and new 
treatments all target people with early Alzheimer’s disease. However, the 
methods used currently to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease are expensive and can be 
unpleasant for patients. We studied Chinese people with no cognitive impairment, 
some cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease and 
non-Alzheimer’s disease dementia. We established a computational model that can 
predict the changes seen in the brain in people with Alzheimer’s disease from 
information including results of blood and memory tests. This non-invasive and 
cost-effective approach might improve early identification of those with 
Alzheimer’s disease.

BACKGROUND: A subset of individuals present at autopsy with the pathologic 
features of Alzheimer's disease having never manifest the clinical symptoms. We 
sought to identify genetic factors that modify the relationship between 
phosphorylated tau (PTau) and dilation of the lateral inferior ventricles.
METHODS: We used data from 700 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A genome-wide association study approach was 
used to identify PTau × single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions. 
Variance explained by these interactions was quantified using hierarchical 
linear regression.
RESULTS: Five SNP × PTau interactions passed a Bonferroni correction, one of 
which (rs4728029, POT1, 2.6% of variance) was consistent across ADNI-1 and 
ADNI-2/GO subjects. This interaction also showed a trend-level association with 
memory performance and levels of interleukin-6 receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rs4728029 modifies the relationship 
between PTau and both ventricular dilation and cognition, perhaps through an 
altered neuroinflammatory response.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Individuals with biomarker evidence of β-amyloid (Aβ) 
deposition are increasingly being enrolled in clinical treatment trials but 
there is a need to identify markers to predict which of these individuals will 
also develop tau deposition. We aimed to determine whether Aβ-positive 
individuals can remain tau-negative for at least 5 years and identify 
characteristics that could distinguish between these individuals and those who 
develop high tau within this period.
METHODS: Tau PET positivity was defined using a Gaussian mixture model with 
log-transformed standard uptake value ratio values from 7 temporal and medial 
parietal regions using all participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) with flortaucipir PET. Tau PET scans were classified as normal 
if the posterior probability of elevated tau was less than 1%. Aβ PET positivity 
was defined based on ADNI cutpoints. We identified all Aβ-positive individuals 
from ADNI who had normal tau PET more than 5 years after their first abnormal Aβ 
PET (amyloid with low tau [ALT] group) and all Aβ-positive individuals with 
abnormal tau PET within 5 years (biomarker AD). In a case-control design, 
logistic regression was used to model the odds of biomarker AD vs ALT accounting 
for sex, age, APOE ε4 carriership, Aβ Centiloid, and hippocampal volume.
RESULTS: We identified 45 individuals meeting criteria for ALT and 157 meeting 
criteria for biomarker AD. The ALT group had a lower proportion of APOE ε4 
carriers, lower Aβ Centiloid, larger hippocampal volumes, and more preserved 
cognition, and were less likely to develop dementia, than the biomarker AD 
group. APOE ε4, higher Aβ Centiloid, and hippocampal atrophy were independently 
associated with increased odds of abnormal tau within 5 years. A Centiloid value 
of 50 effectively discriminated biomarker AD and ALT with 80% sensitivity and 
specificity. The majority of the ALT participants did not develop dementia 
throughout the 5-year interval.
DISCUSSION: Aβ-positive individuals can remain tau-negative for at least 5 
years. Baseline characteristics can help identify these ALT individuals who are 
less likely to develop dementia. Conservative Aβ cutpoints should be utilized 
for clinical trials to better capture individuals with high risk of developing 
biomarker AD.

We developed models for individualized risk prediction of cognitive decline in 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using plasma biomarkers of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau 
and neurodegeneration. A total of 573 patients with MCI from the Swedish 
BioFINDER study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were 
included in the study. The primary outcomes were longitudinal cognition and 
conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. A model combining tau 
phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) and neurofilament light (NfL), but 
not Aβ42/Aβ40, had the best prognosis performance of all models (area under the 
curve = 0.88 for 4-year conversion to AD in BioFINDER, validated in ADNI), was 
stronger than a basic model of age, sex, education and baseline cognition, and 
performed similarly to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. A publicly available 
online tool for individualized prognosis in MCI based on our combined plasma 
biomarker models is introduced. Combination of plasma biomarkers may be of high 
value to identify individuals with MCI who will progress to AD dementia in 
clinical trials and in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that both tau and cardiovascular risk are 
associated with cognitive decline, but the possible synergistic effects of these 
pathologic markers remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the interaction of AD biomarkers with a specific vascular 
risk marker (pulse pressure) on longitudinal cognition.
METHODS: Participants included 139 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Biomarkers of tau, amyloid-β (Aβ), and vascular 
risk (pulse pressure) were assessed. Neuropsychological assessment provided 
memory, language, and executive function domain composite scores at baseline and 
1-year follow-up. Multiple linear regression examined interactive effects of 
pulse pressure with tau PET independent of Aβ PET and Aβ PET independent of tau 
PET on baseline and 1-year cognitive outcomes.
RESULTS: The interaction between pulse pressure and tau PET significantly 
predicted 1-year memory performance such that the combined effect of high pulse 
pressure and high tau PET levels was associated with lower memory at follow-up 
but not at baseline. In contrast, Aβ PET did not significantly interact with 
pulse pressure to predict baseline or 1-year outcomes in any cognitive domain. 
Main effects revealed a significant effect of tau PET on memory, and no 
significant effects of Aβ PET or pulse pressure on any cognitive domain.
CONCLUSION: Results indicate that tau and an indirect marker of arterial 
stiffening (pulse pressure) may synergistically contribute to memory decline, 
whereas Aβ may have a lesser role in predicting cognitive progression. Tau and 
vascular pathology (particularly in combination) may represent valuable targets 
for interventions intended to slow cognitive decline.

The driving theoretical framework of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been built 
around the amyloid-β (Aβ) cascade in which amyloid pathology precedes and drives 
tau pathology. Other evidence has suggested that tau and amyloid pathology may 
arise independently. Both lines of research suggest that there may be epistatic 
relationships between genes involved in amyloid and tau pathophysiology. In the 
current study, we hypothesized that genes coding glycogen synthase kinase 3 
(GSK-3) and comparable tau kinases would modify genetic risk for amyloid plaque 
pathology. Quantitative amyloid positron emission tomography data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative served as the quantitative outcome 
in regression analyses, covarying for age, gender, and diagnosis. Three 
interactions reached statistical significance, all involving the GSK3β single 
nucleotide polymorphism rs334543-2 with APBB2 (rs2585590, rs3098914) and 1 with 
APP (rs457581). These interactions explained 1.2%, 1.5%, and 1.5% of the 
variance in amyloid deposition respectively. Our results add to a growing 
literature on the role of GSK-3 activity in amyloid processing and suggest that 
combined variation in GSK3β and APP-related genes may result in increased 
amyloid burden.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, tau accumulation, and brain atrophy 
occurr in sequence, but the contribution of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology 
to biological and clinical progression remains unclear.
METHODS: We included 290 and 70 participants with longitudinal assessment on 
Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET), tau-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and 
cognitive function from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) and Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, respectively. Partial least 
squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to determine the 
contribution of AD pathology to the biological and clinical longitudinal 
changes.
RESULTS: Imaging biomarkers and cognitive function were significantly associated 
in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. At the final time point, the 
percentage of variance explained by PLS-SEM was 27% for Aβ, 30% for tau (Aβ 
accounted for 61%), 29% for brain atrophy (tau accounted for 37%), and 37% for 
cognitive decline (brain atrophy accounted for 35%).
DISCUSSION: This study highlights distinctive contributing proportions of AD 
pathology to biological and clinical progression. Treatments targeting Aβ and 
tau may partially block AD progression.

BACKGROUND: According to recent studies, amyloid-β (Aβ) isoforms as 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have remarkable predictive value for 
cognitive decline in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we 
aimed to investigate the correlations between several targeted proteomics in CSF 
samples with Aβ ratios and cognitive scores in patients in AD spectrum to search 
for potential early diagnostic utility.
METHODS: A total of 719 participants were found eligible for inclusion. Patients 
were then categorized into cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and AD and underwent an assessment of Aβ and proteomics. Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), and Mini 
Mental State Exam (MMSE) were used for further cognitive assessment. The Aβ42, 
Aβ42/Aβ40, and Aβ42/38 ratios were considered as means of comparison to identify 
those peptides corresponding significantly to these established biomarkers and 
cognitive scores. The diagnostic utility of the IASNTQSR, VAELEDEK, VVSSIEQK, 
GDSVVYGLR, EPVAGDAVPGPK, and QETLPSK was assessed.
RESULTS: All investigated peptides corresponded significantly to Aβ42 in 
controls. In those with MCI, VAELEDEK and EPVAGDAVPGPK were significantly 
correlated with Aβ42 (p value < 0.001). Additionally, IASNTQSR, VVSSIEQK, 
GDSVVYGLR, and QETLPSK were significantly correlated with Aβ42/Aβ40 and Aβ42/38 
(p value < 0.001) in this group. This group of peptides similarly corresponded 
to Aβ ratios in those with AD. Eventually, IASNTQSR, VAELEDEK, and VVSSIEQK were 
significantly associated with CDR, ADAS-11, and ADAS-13, particularly in MCI 
group.
CONCLUSION: Our research suggests potential early diagnostic and prognostic 
utilities for certain peptides extracted from CSF-targeted proteomics research.

Elevated cortisol as a measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis 
hyperactivity has emerged as a predictor of clinical progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), in conjunction with amyloid-β (Aβ) abnormalities. Yet factors 
exist which have the propensity to delay AD symptomatic expression in the face 
of an AD-type biomarker-based pathological profile. This study sought to 
determine whether abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ and elevated cortisol 
levels are associated with clinical transition to mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and AD in cognitively normal (CN) individuals, and if this association is 
modified by reserve proxies. Data from 91 CN individuals participating in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with available morning CSF 
cortisol and Aβ42 were evaluated. Reserve was modelled as a latent composite 
score of standardized intracranial volume and lifetime experience proxies. Cox 
regressions were used to test associations between baseline CSF cortisol/Aβ42, 
reserve score and AD progression; adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E 
genotype, and depressive symptoms. Individuals with elevated cortisol + abnormal 
Aβ42 levels at baseline showed highest risk of clinical progression. After a 
median of 84 months follow-up, significant cortisol/Aβ/ reserve interaction for 
clinical progression was noted (adjusted HR = 0.15, p < 0.001), suggesting a 
moderating effect of reserve on the association between cortisol/Aβ+ and 
clinical progression. Our findings indicate that cortisol hypersecretion 
accelerates clinical progression in CN individuals presenting with pathological 
Aβ42. High reserve reduces the associated AD progression risk in these high-risk 
individuals.

Extracellular amyloid plaques in gray matter are the earliest pathological 
marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by abnormal tau protein 
accumulation. The link between diffusion changes in gray matter, amyloid and tau 
pathology, and cognitive decline is not well understood. We first performed 
cross-sectional analyses on T1-weighted imaging, diffusion MRI, and amyloid and 
tau PETs from the ADNI 2/3 database. We evaluated cortical volume, free-water, 
fractional anisotropy (FA), and amyloid and tau SUVRs in 171 cognitively normal, 
103 MCI, and 44 AD individuals. When the 3 groups were combined, increasing 
amyloid burden was associated with reduced extracellular free-water in the 
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in those with amyloid-negative status whereas 
increasing tau burden was associated with increased extracellular free-water 
regardless of amyloid status. Next, we found that for the MCI subjects, 
diffusion measures (free-water, FA) alone predicted MMSE score 2 years later 
with a high r-square value (87%), as compared to tau SUVRs (27%), T1 volume 
(36%), and amyloid SUVRs (75%). Diffusion measures represent a potent 
non-invasive marker for predicting cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The neuropathologic changes underlying Alzheimer 
disease (AD) start before overt cognitive symptoms arise, but it is not 
well-known how they relate to the first subtle cognitive changes. The objective 
for this study was to examine the independent associations of the AD hallmarks 
β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration with different cognitive domains in 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, CU participants from the prospective 
BioFINDER-2 study were included. All had CSF biomarkers (Aβ42 and phosphorylated 
tau [p-tau]181), MRI (cortical thickness of AD-susceptible regions), Aβ-PET 
(neocortical uptake), tau-PET (entorhinal uptake), and cognitive test data for 
memory, executive function, verbal function, and visuospatial function. 
Multivariable linear regression models were performed using either CSF Aβ42, 
p-tau181, and cortical thickness or Aβ-PET, tau-PET, and cortical thickness as 
predictors of cognitive function. The results were validated in an independent 
cohort (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]).
RESULTS: A total of 316 CU participants were included from the BioFINDER-2 
study. Abnormal Aβ status was independently associated with the executive 
measure, regardless of modality (CSF Aβ42, β = 0.128, p = 0.024; Aβ-PET, β = 
0.124, p = 0.049), while tau was independently associated with memory (CSF 
p-tau181, β = 0.132, p = 0.018; tau-PET, β = 0.189, p = 0.002). Cortical 
thickness was independently associated with the executive measure and verbal 
fluency in both models (p = 0.005-0.018). To examine the relationships in the 
earliest stage of preclinical AD, only participants with normal biomarkers of 
tau and neurodegeneration were included (n = 217 CSF-based; n = 246 PET-based). 
Again, Aβ status was associated with executive function (CSF Aβ42, β = 0.189, p 
= 0.005; Aβ-PET, β = 0.146, p = 0.023), but not with other cognitive domains. 
The results were overall replicated in the ADNI cohort (n = 361).
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that Aβ is independently associated with 
worse performance on an executive measure but not with memory performance, which 
instead is associated with tau pathology. This may have implications for early 
preclinical AD screening and outcome measures in AD trials targeting Aβ 
pathology.

INTRODUCTION: We compared the machine learning-derived, MRI-based Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) resemblance atrophy index (AD-RAI) with plasma neurofilament light 
chain (NfL) level in predicting conversion of early AD among cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects.
METHODS: We recruited participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) who had the following data: clinical features (age, gender, 
education, Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), structural MRI, plasma 
biomarkers (p-tau181 , NfL), cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (CSF) (Aβ42, 
p-tau181 ), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype. We defined AD using CSF 
Aβ42 (A+) and p-tau181 (T+). We defined conversion (C+) if a subject progressed 
to the next syndromal stage within 4 years.
RESULTS: Of 589 participants, 96 (16.3%) were A+T+C+. AD-RAI performed better 
than plasma NfL when added on top of clinical features, plasma p-tau181 , and 
APOE ε4 genotype (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.832 vs. AUC = 0.650 among CU, 
AUC = 0.853 vs. AUC = 0.805 among MCI) in predicting A+T+C+.
DISCUSSION: AD-RAI outperformed plasma NfL in predicting syndromal conversion of 
early AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD-RAI outperformed plasma NfL in predicting syndromal conversion 
among early AD. AD-RAI showed better metrics than volumetric hippocampal 
measures in predicting syndromal conversion. Combining clinical features, plasma 
p-tau181 and apolipoprotein E (APOE) with AD-RAI is the best model for 
predicting syndromal conversion.

The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is to 
optimize and validate biomarkers for clinical trials while sharing all data and 
biofluid samples with the global scientific community. ADNI has been 
instrumental in standardizing and validating amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging. ADNI data were used for the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval of the Fujirebio and Roche Elecsys cerebrospinal 
fluid diagnostic tests. Additionally, ADNI provided data for the trials of the 
FDA-approved treatments aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. More than 6000 
scientific papers have been published using ADNI data, reflecting ADNI's 
promotion of open science and data sharing. Despite its enormous success, ADNI 
has some limitations, particularly in generalizing its data and findings to the 
entire US/Canadian population. This introduction provides a historical overview 
of ADNI and highlights its significant accomplishments and future vision to 
pioneer "the clinical trial of the future" focusing on demographic inclusivity. 
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) introduced a 
novel model for public-private partnerships and data sharing. It successfully 
validated amyloid and Tau PET imaging, as well as CSF and plasma biomarkers, for 
diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. ADNI generated and disseminated vital data for 
designing AD clinical trials.

Hippocampal atrophy is endemic in 'normal aging' but it is unclear what factors 
drive age-related changes in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structural measures. We 
investigated cross-sectional (n = 191) and longitudinal (n = 164) MTL atrophy 
patterns in cognitively normal older adults from ADNI-GO/2 with no to low 
cerebral β-amyloid and assessed whether white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho tau (p-tau) levels can explain age-related 
changes in the MTL. Age was significantly associated with hippocampal volumes 
and Brodmann Area (BA) 35 thickness, regions affected early by neurofibrillary 
tangle pathology, in the cross-sectional analysis and with anterior and/or 
posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and BA35 in the longitudinal analysis. 
CSF p-tau was significantly associated with hippocampal volumes and atrophy 
rates. Mediation analyses showed that CSF p-tau levels partially mediated age 
effects on hippocampal atrophy rates. No significant associations were observed 
for WMHs. These findings point toward a role of tau pathology, potentially 
reflecting Primary Age-Related Tauopathy, in age-related MTL structural changes 
and suggests a potential role for tau-targeted interventions in age-associated 
neurodegeneration and memory decline.

BACKGROUND: The search for a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology 
(amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau) is ongoing, with the best markers currently being 
measurements of Aβ and tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and via positron 
emission tomography (PET) scanning. These methods are relatively invasive, 
costly, and often have high screening failure rates. Consequently, research is 
aiming to elucidate blood biomarkers of Aβ and tau.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate a case/control polygenic risk score 
(PGRS) as a marker of tau and investigate blood markers of a combined Aβ and tau 
outcome for the first time. A sub-study also considers plasma tau as markers of 
Aβ and tau pathology in CSF.
METHODS: We used data from the EDAR*, DESCRIPA**, and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts in a logistic regression analysis to 
investigate blood markers of Aβ and tau in CSF. In particular, we investigated 
the extent to which a case/control PGRS is predictive of CSF tau, CSF amyloid, 
and a combined amyloid and tau outcome. The predictive ability of models was 
compared to that of age, gender, and APOE genotype ('basic model').
RESULTS: In EDAR and DESCRIPA test data, inclusion of a case/control PGRS was no 
more predictive of Aβ, and a combined Aβ and tau endpoint than the basic models 
(accuracies of 66.0%, and 73.3% respectively). The tau model saw a small 
increase in accuracy compared to basic models (59.6%). ADNI 2 test data also 
showed a slight increase in accuracy for the Aβ model when compared to the basic 
models (61.4%).
CONCLUSION: We see some evidence that a case/control PGRS is marginally more 
predictive of Aβ and tau pathology than the basic models. The search for 
predictive factors of Aβ and tau pathologies, above and beyond demographic 
information, is still ongoing. Better understanding of AD risk alleles, 
development of more sensitive assays, and studies of larger sample size are 
three avenues that may provide such factors. However, the clinical utility of 
possible predictors of brain Aβ and tau pathologies must also be 
investigated.*'Beta amyloid oligomers in the early diagnosis of AD and as marker 
for treatment response'**'Development of screening guidelines and criteria for 
pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease'.

The pathogenic relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a decrease of 
cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-ß42 (Aß42) burden and an increase in cerebrospinal 
fluid total tau (T-tau) levels. In this work, we performed genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) and genome-wide interaction study of T-tau/Aß42 ratio 
as an AD imaging quantitative trait on 843 subjects and 563,980 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADNI cohort. We aim to identify not 
only SNPs with significant main effects but also SNPs with interaction effects 
to help explain "missing heritability". Linear regression method was used to 
detect SNP-SNP interactions among SNPs with uncorrected p-value ≤0.01 from the 
GWAS. Age, gender, and diagnosis were considered as covariates in both studies. 
The GWAS results replicated the previously reported AD-related genes APOE, 
APOC1, and TOMM40, as well as identified 14 novel genes, which showed 
genome-wide statistical significance. Genome-wide interaction study revealed 7 
pairs of SNPs meeting the cell-size criteria and with bonferroni-corrected 
p-value ≤0.05. As we expect, these interaction pairs all had marginal main 
effects but explained a relatively high-level variance of T-tau/Aß42, 
demonstrating their potential association with AD pathology.

It is not known exactly where amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils begin to accumulate in 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we showed that abnormal 
levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be detected before abnormal 
amyloid can be detected using PET in individuals with preclinical AD. Using 
these approaches, here we identify the earliest preclinical AD stage in subjects 
from the ADNI and BioFINDER cohorts. We show that Aβ accumulation preferentially 
starts in the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices, 
i.e., several of the core regions of the default mode network (DMN). This early 
pattern of Aβ accumulation is already evident in individuals with normal Aβ42 in 
the CSF and normal amyloid PET who subsequently convert to having abnormal CSF 
Aβ42. The earliest Aβ accumulation is further associated with hypoconnectivity 
within the DMN and between the DMN and the frontoparietal network, but not with 
brain atrophy or glucose hypometabolism. Our results suggest that Aβ fibrils 
start to accumulate predominantly within certain parts of the DMN in preclinical 
AD and already then affect brain connectivity.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is providing critical new 
information on biomarkers in cognitively normal elderly, persons with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
data provide insights into the progression of the pathology of AD over time, 
assist in understanding which biomarkers might be most useful in clinical 
trials, and facilitate development of disease-modifying treatments. ADNI results 
are intended to support new AD treatment development; this report considers how 
ADNI information can be integrated in AD drug development programs. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta protein (Abeta) measures can be used in 
Phase I studies to detect any short term effects on Abeta levels in the CSF. 
Phase II studies may benefit most from biomarker measures that can inform 
decisions about Phase III. CSF Abeta levels, CSF total tau and phospho-tau 
measures, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), Pittsburgh 
Compound B (PIB) amyloid imaging, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be 
employed to select patients in enriched trials or as outcomes for specific 
disease-modifying interventions. Use of biomarkers may allow Phase II trials to 
be conducted more efficiently with smaller populations of patients or shorted 
treatment times. New drug applications (NDAs) may include biomarker outcomes of 
phase III trials. ADNI patients are highly educated and are nearly all of 
Caucasian ethnicity limiting the generalizability of the results to other 
populations commonly included in global clinical trials. ADNI has inspired or 
collaborates with biomarker investigations worldwide and together these studies 
will provide biomarker information that can reduce development times and costs, 
improve drug safety, optimize drug efficacy, and bring new treatments to 
patients with or at risk for AD.

PURPOSE: Several [18F]Flortaucipir cutoffs have been proposed for tau PET 
positivity (T+) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but none were data-driven. The aim 
of this study was to establish and validate unsupervised T+ cutoffs by applying 
Gaussian mixture models (GMM).
METHODS: Amyloid negative (A-) cognitively normal (CN) and amyloid positive (A+) 
AD-related dementia (ADRD) subjects from ADNI (n=269) were included. ADNI 
(n=475) and Geneva Memory Clinic (GMC) cohorts (n=98) were used for validation. 
GMM-based cutoffs were extracted for the temporal meta-ROI, and validated 
against previously published cutoffs and visual rating.
RESULTS: GMM-based cutoffs classified less subjects as T+, mainly in the A- CN 
(<3.4% vs >28.5%) and A+ CN (<14.5% vs >42.9%) groups and showed higher 
agreement with visual rating (ICC=0.91 vs ICC<0.62) than published cutoffs.
CONCLUSION: We provided reliable data-driven [18F]Flortaucipir cutoffs for in 
vivo T+ detection in AD. These cutoffs might be useful to select participants in 
clinical and research studies.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are often present in individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. NPS are 
associated with structural and functional changes in the brain such as atrophy, 
regional hypometabolism, and hypoperfusion, considered proxies of 
neurodegeneration. Our objective was to evaluate the association between NPS and 
regional cerebral tau burden, a more direct representation of neurodegeneration, 
in cognitively normal (CN), MCI, and AD dementia individuals.
METHODS: Cross-sectional NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI) in 410 CN, 199 MCI, and 61 AD dementia participants who underwent 
flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography as part of the AD Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Total NPI score and two factors of NPS (affective and 
hyperactive) were used in analyses. Linear regression models with backward 
elimination were employed with NPI as dependent variable and regional tau or 
tau-amyloid interaction as predictor of interest. Covariates included education, 
age, sex, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Total Learning, and Trail Making 
Test B.
RESULTS: There were significant associations (p < 0.05) between the NPI 
variables (total score, Affective factor) and entorhinal and precuneus tau 
across all participants. These associations were also significant for the 
tau-amyloid interaction. These effects were significant in cognitively 
symptomatic participants (MCI and AD dementia), but not in CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased tau burden in the entorhinal and precuneus cortices was 
modestly associated with greater NPS in MCI and AD dementia. Further evaluation 
of NPS and their effect on early-stage AD could aid in finding new interventions 
and slowing disease progression.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop novel machine learning models for 
predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identify key factors for targeted 
prevention.
METHODS: We included 1,219, 863, and 482 participants aged 60+ years with only 
sociodemographic, both sociodemographic and self-reported health, both the 
former two and blood biomarkers information from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Machine learning models were 
constructed for predicting the risk of AD for the above three populations. Model 
performance was evaluated by discrimination, calibration, and clinical 
usefulness. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) was applied to identify key 
predictors of optimal models.
RESULTS: The mean age was 73.49, 74.52, and 74.29 years for the three 
populations, respectively. Models with sociodemographic information and models 
with both sociodemographic and self-reported health information showed modest 
performance. For models with sociodemographic, self-reported health, and blood 
biomarker information, their overall performance improved substantially, 
specifically, logistic regression performed best, with an AUC value of 0.818. 
Blood biomarkers of ptau protein and plasma neurofilament light, age, blood tau 
protein, and education level were top five significant predictors. In addition, 
taurine, inosine, xanthine, marital status, and L.Glutamine also showed 
importance to AD prediction.
CONCLUSION: Interpretable machine learning showed promise in screening high-risk 
AD individual and could further identify key predictors for targeted prevention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Experimental studies suggest that the balance between 
short and long β-amyloid (Aβ) species might modulate the toxic effects of Aβ in 
Alzheimer disease (AD), but clinical evidence is lacking. We studied whether 
Aβ38 levels in CSF relate to risk of AD dementia and cognitive decline.
METHODS: CSF Aβ38 levels were measured in 656 individuals across 2 clinical 
cohorts: the Swedish BioFINDER study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association 
between baseline Aβ38 levels and risk of AD dementia in AD biomarker-positive 
individuals (AD+; determined by CSF phosphorylated tau [P-tau]/Aβ42 ratio) with 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Linear 
mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between baseline Aβ38 
levels and cognitive decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) in AD+ participants with SCD, MCI, or AD dementia.
RESULTS: In the BioFINDER cohort, high Aβ38 levels were associated with slower 
decline in MMSE score (β = 0.30 points per SD, p = 0.001) and with lower risk of 
conversion to AD dementia (hazard ratio 0.83 per SD, p = 0.03). In the ADNI 
cohort, higher Aβ38 levels were associated with less decline in MMSE score (β = 
0.27, p = 0.01) but not risk of conversion to AD dementia (p = 0.66). Aβ38 
levels in both cohorts were significantly associated with both cognitive and 
clinical outcomes when further adjusted for CSF P-tau or CSF Aβ42 levels.
DISCUSSION: Higher CSF Aβ38 levels are associated with lower risk of AD-related 
changes in 2 independent clinical cohorts. These findings suggest that 
γ-secretase modulators could be effective as disease-altering therapy.

Majority of dementia research is conducted in non-Hispanic White participants 
despite a greater prevalence of dementia in other racial groups. To obtain a 
better understanding of biomarker presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
the non-Hispanic White population, this study exclusively examined AD biomarker 
abnormalities in 85 Black and/or African American participants within the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants were classified 
by the ADNI into 3 clinical groups: cognitively normal, mild cognitive 
impairment, or dementia. Data examined included demographics, apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) ε4, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42, CSF total tau (t-tau), CSF 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau), 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measures of 
cognition and function. Analyses of variance and covariance showed lower 
cortical thickness in 5 of 7 selected MRI regions, lower hippocampal volume, 
greater volume of white matter hyperintensities, lower measures of cognition and 
function, lower measures of CSF Aβ1-42, and greater measures of CSF t-tau and 
p-tau between clinical groups. Our findings confirmed greater AD biomarker 
abnormalities between clinical groups in this sample.

Posterior cortical hypometabolism measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET 
is a well-known marker of Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration, but its 
associations with underlying neuropathological processes are unclear. We 
assessed cross-sectionally the relative contributions of three potential 
mechanisms causing hypometabolism in the retrosplenial and inferior parietal 
cortices: local molecular (amyloid and tau) pathology and atrophy, distant 
factors including contributions from the degenerating medial temporal lobe or 
molecular pathology in functionally connected regions, and the presence of the 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. Two hundred and thirty-two amyloid-positive 
cognitively impaired patients from two cohorts [University of California, San 
Francisco (UCSF), and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)] 
underwent MRI and PET with FDG, amyloid-PET using 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B, 
18F-florbetapir or 18F-florbetaben, and 18F-flortaucipir tau-PET in 1 year. 
Standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated using tracer-specific 
reference regions. Regression analyses were run within cohorts to identify 
variables associated with retrosplenial or inferior parietal FDG standard uptake 
value ratios. On average, ADNI patients were older and were less impaired than 
the UCSF patients. Regional patterns of hypometabolism were similar between 
cohorts, although there were cohort differences in regional grey matter atrophy. 
Local cortical thickness and tau-PET (but not amyloid-PET) were independently 
associated with both retrosplenial and inferior parietal FDG SUVRs (ΔR2 = 0.09 
to 0.21) across cohorts in models that also included age and disease severity 
(local model). Including medial temporal lobe volume improved the retrosplenial 
FDG model in the ADNI cohort (ΔR2 = 0.04, P = 0.008) but not for the UCSF (ΔR2 < 
0.01, P = 0.52), and did not improve the inferior parietal models (ΔR2 < 0.01, P 
> 0.37). Interaction analyses revealed that medial temporal volume was more 
strongly associated with retrosplenial FDG SUVRs at earlier disease stages (P = 
0.06 in UCSF, P = 0.046 in ADNI). Exploratory analyses across the cortex 
confirmed overall associations between hypometabolism and local tau pathology 
and thickness and revealed associations between medial temporal degeneration and 
hypometabolism in retrosplenial, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. 
Finally, our data did not support hypotheses of a detrimental effect of 
pathology in connected regions or of an effect of the APOE ε4 allele in impaired 
participants. Overall, in two independent groups of patients at symptomatic 
stages of Alzheimer's disease, cortical hypometabolism mainly reflected 
structural neurodegeneration and tau, but not amyloid, pathology.

BACKGROUND: The APOE genotype has emerged as the major genetic factor for AD but 
differs among different alleles.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the discrepant effects of APOE genotype on AD 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.
METHODS: A total of 989 non-demented ADNI participants were included. The 
associations of APOEɛ2 and APOEɛ4 with CSF biomarkers were investigated using 
linear regression models. Interaction and subgroup analyses were used to 
investigate the effects of sex and age on these associations. Furthermore, we 
used mediation analyses to assess whether Aβ mediated the associations between 
APOE genotypes and tau.
RESULTS: APOEɛ2 carriers only showed higher Aβ levels (β [95% CI] = 0.07 [0.01, 
0.13], p = 0.026). Conversely, APOEɛ4 carriers exhibited lower Aβ concentration 
(β [95% CI] = -0.27 [-0.31, -0.24], p < 0.001), higher t-Tau (β [95% CI] = 0.25 
[0.08, 0.18], p < 0.001) and higher p-Tau (β [95% CI] = 0.31 [0.25, 0.37], 
p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that APOE ɛ2 was significantly positively 
associated with Aβ only in females (β [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.04, 0.21], p = 0.005) 
and older people (β [95% CI] = 0.06 [0.001, 0.12], p = 0.048). But the effects 
of APOE ɛ4 were independent of gender and age. Besides, the associations of APOE 
ɛ4 with t-Tau and p-Tau were both mediated by baseline Aβ.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that APOEɛ2 could promote Aβ clearance, while 
the process could be modified by sex and age. However, APOEɛ4 might cause the 
accumulation of Aβ and tau pathology independent of sex and age.

BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have broad potential 
as screening tools in primary care and disease-modifying trials. Detecting 
elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology to support trial recruitment or initiating 
Aβ-targeting treatments would be of critical value. In this study, we aimed to 
examine the robustness of plasma biomarkers to detect elevated Aβ pathology at 
different stages of the AD continuum. Beyond determining the best biomarker-or 
biomarker combination-for detecting this outcome, we also simulated increases in 
inter-assay coefficient of variability (CV) to account for external factors not 
considered by intra-assay variability. With this, we aimed to determine whether 
plasma biomarkers would maintain their accuracy if applied in a setting which 
anticipates higher variability (i.e., clinical routine).
METHODS: We included 118 participants (cognitively unimpaired [CU, n = 50], 
cognitively impaired [CI, n = 68]) from the ADNI study with a full plasma 
biomarker profile (Aβ42/40, GFAP, p-tau181, NfL) and matched amyloid imaging. 
Initially, we investigated how simulated CV variations impacted single-biomarker 
discriminative performance of amyloid status. Then, we evaluated the predictive 
performance of models containing different biomarker combinations, based both on 
original and simulated measurements. Plasma Aβ42/40 was represented by both 
immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and single molecule array (Simoa) 
methods in separate analyses. Model selection was based on a decision tree which 
incorporated Akaike information criterion value, likelihood ratio tests between 
the best-fitting models and, finally, and Schwartz's Bayesian information 
criterion.
RESULTS: Increasing variation greatly impacted the performance of plasma Aβ42/40 
in discriminating Aβ status. In contrast, the performance of plasma GFAP and 
p-tau181 remained stable with variations >20%. When biomarker models were 
compared, the models "AG" (Aβ42/40 + GFAP; AUC = 86.5), "A" (Aβ42/40; 
AUC = 82.3), and "AGP" (Aβ42/40 + GFAP + p-tau181; AUC = 93.5) were superior in 
determining Aβ burden in all participants, within-CU, and within-CI groups, 
respectively. In the robustness analyses, when repeating model selection based 
on simulated measurements, models including IP-MS Aβ42/40 were also most often 
selected. Simoa Aβ42/40 did not contribute to any selected model when used as an 
immunoanalytical alternative to IP-MS Aβ42/40.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma Aβ42/40, as quantified by IP-MS, shows high performance in 
determining Aβ positivity at all stages of the AD continuum, with GFAP and 
p-tau181 further contributing at CI stage. However, between-assay variations 
greatly impacted the performance of Aβ42/40 but not that of GFAP and p-tau181. 
Therefore, when dealing with between-assay CVs that exceed 5%, plasma GFAP and 
p-tau181 should be considered for a more robust determination of Aβ burden in CU 
and CI participants, respectively.

Bridging the gap between cortical morphometric remodeling and gene expression 
can help to clarify the effects of the selective brain accumulation of Amyloid-β 
(Aβ) and tau proteins occurring in the Alzheimer's disease (AD). To this aim, we 
derived morphometric similarity (MS) networks from 126 Aβ- and tau-positive 
(Aβ+/tau+) and 172 Aβ-/tau- subjects, and we investigated the association 
between group-wise regional MS differences and transcriptional correlates thanks 
to an imaging transcriptomics approach grounded in the Allen Human Brain Atlas 
(AHBA). The expressed gene with the highest correlation with MS alterations was 
BCHE, a gene related to Aβ homeostasis. In addition, notably, among the most 
promising results derived from the enrichment analysis, we found the immune 
response to be a biological process and astrocytes, microglia, and 
oligodendrocyte precursors for the cell types. In summary, by relating cortical 
MS and AHBA-derived transcriptomics, we were able to retrieve findings 
suggesting the biological mechanisms underlying the Aβ- and tau- induced 
cortical MS alterations in the AD continuum.

IMPORTANCE: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOEε4) is the single most important genetic 
risk factor for Alzheimer disease. While APOEε4 is associated with increased 
amyloid-β burden, its association with cerebral tau pathology has been 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether APOEε4 is associated with medial temporal tau 
pathology independently of amyloid-β, sex, clinical status, and age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a study of 2 cross-sectional cohorts 
of volunteers who were cognitively normal, had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
or had Alzheimer disease dementia: the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and 
Dementia (TRIAD) study (data collected between October 2017 and July 2019) and 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (collected between 
November 2015 and June 2019). The first cohort (TRIAD) comprised cognitively 
normal elderly participants (n = 124), participants with MCI (n = 50), and 
participants with Alzheimer disease (n = 50) who underwent tau positron emission 
tomography (PET) with fluorine 18-labeled MK6240 and amyloid-β PET with 
[18F]AZD4694. The second sample (ADNI) was composed of cognitively normal 
elderly participants (n = 157), participants with MCI (n = 83), and participants 
with Alzheimer disease (n = 25) who underwent tau PET with [18F]flortaucipir and 
amyloid-β PET with [18F]florbetapir. Exclusion criteria were a history of other 
neurological disorders, stroke, or head trauma. There were 489 eligible 
participants, selected based on availability of amyloid-PET, tau-PET, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and genotyping for APOEε4. Forty-five young adults (<30 
years) from the TRIAD cohort were not selected for this study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A main association between APOEε4 and tau-PET 
standardized uptake value ratio, correcting for age, sex, clinical status, and 
neocortical amyloid-PET standardized uptake value ratio.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 489 participants was 70.5 (7.1) years; 171 
were APOEε4 carriers (34.9%), and 230 of 489 were men. In both cohorts, APOEε4 
was associated in increased tau-PET uptake in the entorhinal cortex and 
hippocampus independently of amyloid-β, sex, age, and clinical status after 
multiple comparisons correction (TRIAD: β = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.49; ADNI: 
β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.19; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results indicate that the elevated risk of 
developing dementia conferred by APOEε4 genotype involves mechanisms associated 
with both amyloid-β and tau aggregation. These results contribute to an evolving 
framework in which APOEε4 has deleterious consequences in Alzheimer disease 
beyond its link with amyloid-β and suggest APOEε4 as a potential target for 
future disease-modifying therapeutic trials targeting tau pathology.

BACKGROUND: Recently, tau PET tracers have shown strong associations with 
clinical outcomes in individuals with cognitive impairment and cognitively 
unremarkable elderly individuals. flortaucipir PET scans to measure tau 
deposition in multiple brain areas as the disease progresses. This information 
needs to be summarized to evaluate disease severity and predict disease 
progression. We, therefore, sought to develop a machine learning-derived index, 
SPARE-Tau, which successfully detects pathology in the earliest disease stages 
and accurately predicts progression compared to a priori-based region of 
interest approaches (ROI).
METHODS: 587 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort had flortaucipir scans, structural MRI scans, and an Aβ biomarker 
test (CSF or florbetapir PET) performed on the same visit. We derived the 
SPARE-Tau index in a subset of 367 participants. We evaluated associations with 
clinical measures for CSF p-tau, SPARE-MRI, and flortaucipir PET indices 
(SPARE-Tau, meta-temporal, and average Braak ROIs). Bootstrapped multivariate 
adaptive regression splines linear regression analyzed the association between 
the biomarkers and baseline ADAS-Cog13 scores. Bootstrapped multivariate linear 
regression models evaluated associations with clinical diagnosis. Cox-hazards 
and mixed-effects models investigated clinical progression and longitudinal 
ADAS-Cog13 changes. The Aβ positive cognitively unremarkable participants, not 
included in the SPARE-Tau training, served as an independent validation group.
RESULTS: Compared to CSF p-tau, meta-temporal, and averaged Braak tau PET ROIs, 
SPARE-Tau showed the strongest association with baseline ADAS-cog13 scores and 
diagnosis. SPARE-Tau also presented the strongest association with clinical 
progression in cognitively unremarkable participants and longitudinal ADAS-Cog13 
changes. Results were confirmed in the Aβ+ cognitively unremarkable hold-out 
sample participants. CSF p-tau showed the weakest cross-sectional associations 
and longitudinal prediction.
DISCUSSION: Flortaucipir indices showed the strongest clinical association among 
the studied biomarkers (flortaucipir, florbetapir, structural MRI, and CSF 
p-tau) and were predictive in the preclinical disease stages. Among the 
flortaucipir indices, the machine-learning derived SPARE-Tau index was the most 
sensitive clinical progression biomarker. The combination of different biomarker 
modalities better predicted cognitive performance.

Here, we review progress by the Penn Biomarker Core in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) toward developing a pathological cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarker signature for mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) as 
well as a biomarker profile that predicts conversion of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and/or normal control subjects to AD. The Penn Biomarker Core 
also collaborated with other ADNI Cores to integrate data across ADNI to 
temporally order changes in clinical measures, imaging data, and chemical 
biomarkers that serve as mileposts and predictors of the conversion of normal 
control to MCI as well as MCI to AD, and the progression of AD. Initial CSF 
studies by the ADNI Biomarker Core revealed a pathological CSF biomarker 
signature of AD defined by the combination of Abeta1-42 and total tau (T-tau) 
that effectively delineates mild AD in the large multisite prospective clinical 
investigation conducted in ADNI. This signature appears to predict conversion 
from MCI to AD. Data fusion efforts across ADNI Cores generated a model for the 
temporal ordering of AD biomarkers which suggests that Abeta amyloid biomarkers 
become abnormal first, followed by changes in neurodegenerative biomarkers (CSF 
tau, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging) with the onset of clinical symptoms. The timing of these changes varies 
in individual patients due to genetic and environmental factors that increase or 
decrease an individual's resilience in response to progressive accumulations of 
AD pathologies. Further studies in ADNI will refine this model and render the 
biomarkers studied in ADNI more applicable to routine diagnosis and to clinical 
trials of disease modifying therapies.

BACKGROUND: Reliable, widely accessible and affordable biomarkers for predicting 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain pathology status are a necessity to aid 
development of prevention strategies in cognitively healthy at-risk older 
adults, at the right timepoint. Measurements of the key neuropathological 
hallmark beta-amyloid (Aβ) by PET neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid measures 
reflect its accumulation in the brain, yet recent methodological advancements 
now enable blood-based measures reflecting cerebral amyloid burden.
OBJECTIVES: The current study validated the capacity of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 
measured using six different assays to predict amyloid positivity in a subgroup 
of cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants in the ADNI study and assessed its 
ability to discriminate CU from AD cases. We also explored economic viability of 
using two different plasma amyloid assays for pre-screening in AD prevention 
trials and as routine clinical diagnostic tool, versus amyloid PET alone.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of plasma and brain amyloid data, including 
comparative cost analysis of the plasma biomarkers in relation to brain amyloid 
PET.
SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
PARTICIPANTS: ADNI participants consisting of 115 CU, mild cognitive impairment 
and AD cases who had plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 measured with six platforms.
MEASUREMENTS: Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 was measured via six different platforms: three 
immunoassays (Roche, Quanterix and ADx Neurosciences) and three mass 
spectrometry (MS) based assays (WashU, Shimadzu and Gothenburg). Aβ-PET imaging 
was conducted within three months of plasma sampling using [18F]florbetapir.
RESULTS: There was a weak to moderate correlation of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio 
between platforms. The MS-based WashU test had the highest capacity to 
discriminate between CU and AD (area under the curve, AUC = 0.734, 95% CI: 
0.613-0.854; P = 0.008). Within the CU group, the WashU plasma amyloid test had 
the best discriminative capacity to distinguish Aβ+ from Aβ- (AUC = 0.753, 95% 
CI: 0.601-0.905; P = 0.003) closely followed by the immunoassay from Roche (AUC 
= 0.737, 95% CI: 0.597-0.877; P = 0.006). The exploratory economic analyses 
showed that the use of Roche or WashU plasma amyloid assay as a pre-screening 
tool prior to Aβ-PET scans for clinical trial recruitment significantly reduced 
total screening cost (saving up to $5882 per recruited patient) expected in an 
AD prevention trial.
CONCLUSIONS: With few available treatment strategies, dementia prevention is a 
global priority. CU individuals at risk for AD are the target population for 
dementia prevention but have been poorly studied. Our findings confirming 
diagnostic value of ultrasensitive immunoassays and high-performance 
immunoprecipitation coupled with MS for measurement of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 to 
detect PET amyloid positivity in CU participants allude to potential clinical 
utility of this biomarker. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 could be optimal for pre-selecting 
at-risk candidates for more invasive and expensive investigations across AD 
prevention clinical trials and clinical care for a rapidly ageing population.

INTRODUCTION: The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) is to validate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
clinical trials. ADNI-3, which began on August 1, 2016, is a 5-year renewal of 
the current ADNI-2 study.
METHODS: ADNI-3 will follow current and additional subjects with normal 
cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD using innovative technologies such 
as tau imaging, magnetic resonance imaging sequences for connectivity analyses, 
and a highly automated immunoassay platform and mass spectroscopy approach for 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis. A Systems Biology/pathway approach will 
be used to identify genetic factors for subject selection/enrichment. Amyloid 
positron emission tomography scanning will be standardized using the Centiloid 
method. The Brain Health Registry will help recruit subjects and monitor subject 
cognition.
RESULTS: Multimodal analyses will provide insight into AD pathophysiology and 
disease progression.
DISCUSSION: ADNI-3 will aim to inform AD treatment trials and facilitate 
development of AD disease-modifying treatments.

BACKGROUND: Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene polymorphism has been reported to 
play a role in the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of BIN1 loci with neuroinflammation and AD 
pathology.
METHODS: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N = 495) was the 
discovery cohort, and Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE, 
N = 619) study was used to replicate the results. Two BIN1 gene polymorphism 
(rs7561528 and rs744373) were included in the analysis. Multiple linear 
regression model and causal mediation analysis conducted through 10,000 
bootstrapped iterations were used to examine the BIN1 loci relationship with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and alternative biomarker of microglial 
activation microglia-soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 
(sTREM2).
RESULTS: In ADNI database, we found a significant association between BIN1 loci 
(rs7561528 and rs744373) and levels of CSF phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) 
(pc = 0.017; 0.010, respectively) and total-tau (T-tau) (pc = 0.011; 0.013, 
respectively). The BIN1 loci were also correlated with CSF sTREM2 levels 
(pc = 0.010; 0.008, respectively). Mediation analysis demonstrated that CSF 
sTREM2 partially mediated the association of BIN1 loci with P-tau (Proportion of 
rs7561528 : 20.8%; Proportion of rs744373 : 24.8%) and T-tau (Proportion of 
rs7561528 : 36.5%; Proportion of rs744373 : 43.9%). The analysis in CABLE study 
replicated the mediation role of rs7561528.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the correlation between BIN1 loci and CSF 
AD biomarkers as well as microglia biomarkers. Additionally, the link between 
BIN1 loci and tau pathology was partially mediated by CSF sTREM2.

Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be mostly driven by 
tau neurofibrillary tangles. However, both tau and neurodegeneration exhibit 
variability in their distribution across the brain and among individuals, and 
the relationship between tau and neurodegeneration might be influenced by 
several factors. I aimed to map local molecular and connectivity characteristics 
that affect the association between tau pathology and neurodegeneration. The 
current study was conducted on the cross-sectional tau-PET and longitudinal 
T1-weighted MRI scan data of 186 participants from the ADNI dataset including 71 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 115 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals. 
Furthermore, the normative molecular profile of a region was defined using 
neurotransmitter receptor densities, gene expression, T1w/T2w ratio 
(myelination), FDG-PET (glycolytic index, glucose metabolism, and oxygen 
metabolism), and synaptic density. I found that the excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) 
ratio, myelination, synaptic density, glycolytic index, and functional 
connectivity are linked with deviation in the relationship between tau and 
neurodegeneration. Furthermore, there was spatial similarity between tau 
pathology and glycolytic index, synaptic density, and functional connectivity 
across brain regions. The current study demonstrates that the regional 
susceptibility to tau-related neurodegeneration is associated with specific 
molecular and connectomic characteristics of the affected neural systems. I 
found that the molecular and connectivity architecture of the human brain is 
linked to the different effects of tau pathology on downstream 
neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease involves many neurobiological alterations from molecular to 
macroscopic spatial scales, but we currently lack integrative, mechanistic brain 
models characterizing how factors across different biological scales interact to 
cause clinical deterioration in a way that is subject-specific or personalized. 
As important signalling molecules and mediators of many neurobiological 
interactions, neurotransmitter receptors are promising candidates for 
identifying molecular mechanisms and drug targets in Alzheimer's disease. We 
present a neurotransmitter receptor-enriched multifactorial brain model, which 
integrates spatial distribution patterns of 15 neurotransmitter receptors from 
post-mortem autoradiography with multiple in vivo neuroimaging modalities (tau, 
amyloid-β and glucose PET, and structural, functional and arterial spin 
labelling MRI) in a personalized, generative, whole-brain formulation. In a 
heterogeneous aged population (n = 423, ADNI data), models with personalized 
receptor-neuroimaging interactions showed a significant improvement over 
neuroimaging-only models, explaining about 70% (±20%) of the variance in 
longitudinal changes to the six neuroimaging modalities. In Alzheimer's disease 
patients (n = 25, ADNI data), receptor-imaging interactions explained up to 
39.7% (P < 0.003, family-wise error-rate-corrected) of inter-individual 
variability in cognitive deterioration, via an axis primarily affecting 
executive function. Notably, based on their contribution to the clinical 
severity in Alzheimer's disease, we found significant functional alterations to 
glutamatergic interactions affecting tau accumulation and neural activity 
dysfunction and GABAergic interactions concurrently affecting neural activity 
dysfunction, amyloid and tau distributions, as well as significant cholinergic 
receptor effects on tau accumulation. Overall, GABAergic alterations had the 
largest effect on cognitive impairment (particularly executive function) in our 
Alzheimer's disease cohort (n = 25). Furthermore, we demonstrate the clinical 
applicability of this approach by characterizing subjects based on 
individualized 'fingerprints' of receptor alterations. This study introduces the 
first robust, data-driven framework for integrating several neurotransmitter 
receptors, multimodal neuroimaging and clinical data in a flexible and 
interpretable brain model. It enables further understanding of the mechanistic 
neuropathological basis of neurodegenerative progression and heterogeneity, and 
constitutes a promising step towards implementing personalized, 
neurotransmitter-based treatments.

As a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 
plasma p-tau181 is robustly differentiated AD dementia from non-AD 
neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) associated with plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181) 
levels that affect the risk of developing AD. We carried out a genome-wide 
association study for plasma p-tau181 levels using participants from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The thresholds of 
P < 5 × 10-6 was used for suggestive associations, and thresholds of 
P < 5 × 10-8 was used for significant associations. Subsequently, we tested 
whether the associations remained significant in subgroup analysis and examined 
the impact of SNPs on the longitudinal changes in plasma p-tau181 levels. A 
total of 714 eligible non-Hispanic white participants with plasma p-tau181 data 
were included. The most significant SNP (rs769449, P = 6.26 × 10-8) in APOE gene 
was suggestively associated with plasma p-tau181, which is close to the 
genome-wide significance threshold. The minor allele (A) of rs769449 in the APOE 
was associated with higher plasma p-tau181 levels in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Besides, rs769449- A carriers were more likely to exhibit a greater longitudinal 
cognitive decline (P = 0.03). Our results suggest that the AD risk variant in 
the APOE gene participates in the regulation of plasma p-tau181. The plasma 
p-tau181 concentration could be a useful endophenotype for identifying risk for 
AD in elderly individuals.

OBJECTIVE: Polygenic variation accounts for a substantial portion of the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its effect on the rate of fibrillar-tau 
accumulation as a key driver of dementia symptoms is unclear.
METHODS: We combined the to-date largest number of genetic risk variants of AD 
(n = 85 lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) from recent genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) to generate a polygenic score (PGS). We assessed 
longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid-PET, and cognition 
in 231 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
Using the PGS, together with global amyloid-PET, we predicted the rate of 
tau-PET increases in Braak-stage regions-of-interest and cognitive decline. We 
also assessed PGS-risk enrichment effects on the required sample size in 
clinical trials targeting tau pathology.
RESULTS: We found that a higher PGS was associated with higher rates of tau-PET 
accumulation, in particular at elevated amyloid-PET levels. The tau-PET 
increases mediated the association between PGS and faster cognitive decline. 
Risk enrichment through high PGS afforded sample size savings by 34%.
INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that the PGS predicts faster tau 
progression and thus cognitive decline, showing utility to enhance statistical 
power in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:819-829.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events 
involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based 
neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and 
eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence 
of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly 
understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between 
classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack 
et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among 
four classes of biomarkers: CSF Aβ, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal 
volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and 
executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test 
hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later 
markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later 
markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF Aβ's 
relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables 
would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, 
results indicated that CSF Aβ effects on cognition change were substantially 
attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau 
effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary 
to hypotheses, CSF Aβ and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on 
neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent 
of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying 
the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β42 peptide (Aβ42) and 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and blood p-tau are valuable for differential 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from cognitively normal (CN) there is a 
lack of validated biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine how plasma and CSF protein markers 
compared in the characterization of MCI and AD status.
METHODS: This cohort study included Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) participants who had baseline levels of 75 proteins measured commonly in 
plasma and CSF (257 total, 46 CN, 143 MCI, and 68 AD). Logistic regression, 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Random Forest (RF) 
methods were used to identify the protein candidates for the disease 
classification.
RESULTS: We observed that six plasma proteins panel (APOE, AMBP, C3, IL16, 
IGFBP2, APOD) outperformed the seven CSF proteins panel (VEGFA, HGF, PRL, FABP3, 
FGF4, CD40, RETN) as well as AD markers (CSF p-tau and Aβ42) to distinguish the 
MCI from AD [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75 (plasma proteins), AUC = 0.60 
(CSF proteins) and AUC = 0.56 (CSF p-tau and Aβ42)]. Also, these six plasma 
proteins performed better than the CSF proteins and were in line with CSF p-tau 
and Aβ42 in differentiating CN versus MCI subjects [AUC = 0.89 (plasma 
proteins), AUC = 0.85 (CSF proteins) and AUC = 0.89 (CSF p-tau and Aβ42)]. These 
results were adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOEϵ4 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the combination of 6 plasma proteins can 
serve as an effective marker for differentiating MCI from AD and CN.

BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of total tau (t-tau) and Aβ1-42 
are potential early diagnostic markers for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
The influence of genetic variation on these CSF biomarkers has been investigated 
in candidate or genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the 
investigation of statistically modest associations in GWAS in the context of 
biological networks is still an under-explored topic in AD studies. The main 
objective of this study is to gain further biological insights via the 
integration of statistical gene associations in AD with physical protein 
interaction networks.
RESULTS: The CSF and genotyping data of 843 study subjects (199 CN, 85 SMC, 239 
EMCI, 207 LMCI, 113 AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were analyzed. PLINK was used to perform GWAS on the t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio 
using quality controlled genotype data, including 563,980 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), with age, sex and diagnosis as covariates. Gene-level 
p-values were obtained by VEGAS2. Genes with p-value ≤ 0.05 were mapped on to a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (9,617 nodes, 39,240 edges, from the 
HPRD Database). We integrated a consensus model strategy into the iPINBPA 
network analysis framework, and named it as CM-iPINBPA. Four consensus modules 
(CMs) were discovered by CM-iPINBPA, and were functionally annotated using the 
pathway analysis tool Enrichr. The intersection of four CMs forms a common 
subnetwork of 29 genes, including those related to tau phosphorylation (GSK3B, 
SUMO1, AKAP5, CALM1 and DLG4), amyloid beta production (CASP8, PIK3R1, PPA1, 
PARP1, CSNK2A1, NGFR, and RHOA), and AD (BCL3, CFLAR, SMAD1, and HIF1A).
CONCLUSIONS: This study coupled a consensus module (CM) strategy with the 
iPINBPA network analysis framework, and applied it to the GWAS of CSF 
t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio in an AD study. The genome-wide network analysis yielded 4 
enriched CMs that share not only genes related to tau phosphorylation or amyloid 
beta production but also multiple genes enriching several KEGG pathways such as 
Alzheimer's disease, colorectal cancer, gliomas, renal cell carcinoma, 
Huntington's disease, and others. This study demonstrated that integration of 
gene-level associations with CMs could yield statistically significant findings 
to offer valuable biological insights (e.g., functional interaction among the 
protein products of these genes) and suggest high confidence candidates for 
subsequent analyses.

INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4-carrier status or ε4 allele count are 
included in analyses to account for the APOE genetic effect on Alzheimer's 
disease (AD); however, this does not account for protective effects of APOE ε2 
or heterogeneous effect of ε2, ε3, and ε4 haplotypes.
METHODS: We leveraged results from an autopsy-confirmed AD study to generate a 
weighted risk score for APOE (APOE-npscore). We regressed cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) amyloid and tau biomarkers on APOE variables from the Wisconsin Registry 
for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 
(WADRC), and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: The APOE-npscore explained more variance and provided a better model 
fit for all three CSF measures than APOE ε4-carrier status and ε4 allele count. 
These findings were replicated in ADNI and observed in subsets of cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) participants.
DISCUSSION: The APOE-npscore reflects the genetic effect on neuropathology and 
provides an improved method to account for APOE in AD-related analyses.

There is increasing evidence of different subtypes of individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). An important line of research is whether 
neuropsychologically-defined subtypes have distinct patterns of 
neurodegeneration and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker composition. In our 
study, we demonstrated that MCI participants of the ADNI database (N = 640) can 
be discriminated into 3 coherent neuropsychological subgroups. Our clustering 
approach revealed amnestic MCI, mixed MCI, and cluster-derived normal subgroups. 
Furthermore, classification modeling revealed that specific predictive features 
can be used to differentiate amnestic and mixed MCI from cognitively normal (CN) 
controls: CSF Aβ142 concentration for the former and CSF Aβ1-42 concentration, 
tau concentration as well as grey matter atrophy (especially in the temporal and 
occipital lobes) for the latter. In contrast, participants from the 
cluster-derived normal subgroup exhibited an identical profile to CN controls in 
terms of cognitive performance, brain structure, and CSF biomarker levels. Our 
comprehensive data analytics strategy provides further evidence that multimodal 
neuropsychological subtyping is both clinically and neurobiologically 
meaningful.

BACKGROUND: Clusterin is a multifunctional protein, which is associated with the 
pathogenesis and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with 
normal controls, inconsistent results have yielded in previous studies for 
concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin in AD patients. We explored 
CSF clusterin levels in different pathological processes of AD.
METHODS: Following the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association 
(NIA-AA) criteria, we employed on the levels of CSF Aβ42(A), phosphorylated-Tau 
(T), and total-tau (N). Based on previously published cutoffs and the close 
correlation between CSF p-tau and t-tau, 276 participants from the publicly 
available ADNI database with CSF biomarkers were divided into four groups: 
A-(TN)- (normal Aβ42 and normal p-tau and t-tau; n = 50), A+(TN)- (abnormal Aβ42 
and normal p-tau and t-tau; n = 39), A+(TN) + (abnormal Aβ42 and abnormal p-tau 
or t-tau; n = 147), A-(TN) + (normal Aβ42 and abnormal p-tau or t-tau; n = 40). 
To assess CSF clusterin levels in AD continuum, intergroup differences in four 
groups were compared. Pairwise comparisons were conducted as appropriate 
followed by Bonferroni post hoc analyses. To further study the relationships 
between CSF clusterin levels and AD core pathological biomarkers, we employed 
multiple linear regression method in subgroups.
RESULTS: Compared with the A-(TN)- group, CSF clusterin levels were decreased in 
A+ (TN)- group (P = 0.002 after Bonferroni correction), but increased in the 
A+(TN) + group and the A-(TN) + group (both P <  0.001 after Bonferroni 
correction). Moreover, we found CSF clusterin levels are positively associated 
with CSF Aβ42 (β = 0.040, P <  0. 001), CSF p-tau (β = 0.325, P <  0.001) and 
CSF t-tau (β = 0.346, P <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that there are differences levels of CSF 
clusterin in different stages of AD pathology. The CSF clusterin level decreased 
at the early stage are related to abnormal Aβ pathology; and the increased 
levels are associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Tau-PET is a prognostic marker for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's 
disease, and the heterogeneity of tau-PET patterns matches cognitive symptom 
heterogeneity. Thus, tau-PET may allow precision-medicine prediction of 
individual tau-related cognitive trajectories, which can be important for 
determining patient-specific cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. Here, we 
aimed to examine whether tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions, 
identified via fMRI meta-analyses, allows the prediction of domain-specific 
cognitive decline. Further, we aimed to determine whether tau-PET-informed 
personalized cognitive composites capture patient-specific cognitive 
trajectories more sensitively than conventional cognitive measures.
METHODS: We included Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
participants classified as controls (i.e., amyloid-negative, cognitively normal, 
n = 121) or Alzheimer's disease-spectrum (i.e., amyloid-positive, cognitively 
normal to dementia, n = 140), plus 111 AVID-1451-A05 participants for 
independent validation (controls/Alzheimer's disease-spectrum=46/65). All 
participants underwent baseline 18F-flortaucipir tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and 
longitudinal cognitive testing to assess annual cognitive changes (i.e., 
episodic memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial). Cognitive 
changes were calculated using linear mixed models. Independent meta-analytical 
task-fMRI activation maps for each included cognitive domain were obtained from 
the Neurosynth database and applied to tau-PET to determine tau-PET signal in 
cognitive-domain-specific brain regions. In bootstrapped linear regression, we 
assessed the strength of the relationship (i.e., partial R2) between 
cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global or temporal-lobe tau-PET and 
cognitive changes. Further, we used tau-PET-based prediction of domain-specific 
decline to compose personalized cognitive composites that were tailored to 
capture patient-specific cognitive decline.
RESULTS: In both amyloid-positive cohorts (ADNI [age = 75.99±7.69] and A05 [age 
= 74.03±9.03]), cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperformed global and 
temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline in episodic 
memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. Further, a 
tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite across cognitive domains 
enhanced the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline in amyloid-positive 
subjects, yielding lower sample sizes required for detecting simulated 
intervention effects compared to conventional cognitive endpoints (i.e., memory 
composite, global cognitive composite). However, the latter effect was less 
strong in A05 compared to the ADNI cohort.
CONCLUSION: Combining tau-PET with task-fMRI-derived maps of major cognitive 
domains facilitates the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. This 
approach may help to increase the sensitivity to detect Alzheimer's 
disease-related cognitive decline and to determine personalized cognitive 
endpoints in clinical trials.

To assess plasma phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) as a progression biomarker in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examined longitudinal plasma p-tau181 of 1184 
participants (403 cognitively normal (CN), 560 patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and 221 with AD dementia) from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The plasma p-tau level was increased at baseline 
for MCI and AD dementia (mean: CN, 15.4 pg/mL; MCI, 18.4 pg/mL; AD dementia, 
23.7 pg/mL; P < 0.001) and increased significantly over time at preclinical 
(Aβ-positive CN), prodromal (Aβ-positive MCI), and dementia (Aβ-positive 
dementia) stage of AD. A longitudinal increase of plasma p-tau181 was associated 
with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels (low Aβ42, high 
phosphorylated tau, and high total tau, all P < 0.001), amyloid accumulation 
(P < 0.001) and hypometabolism (P = 0.002) on positron emission tomography, 
atrophy in structure imaging (small hippocampal (P = 0.030), middle temporal 
(P = 0.008), and whole brain (P = 0.027) volume, and large ventricular volume 
(P = 0.008)), and deteriorated cognitive performance (global cognition and 
memory, language, executive function, and visuospatial function, all P < 0.050) 
at baseline. Furthermore, longitudinal plasma p-tau181 correlated with 
concurrent changes of nearly all these AD-related hallmarks and faster increase 
in plasma p-tau181 correlated with faster worsening cognition in all diagnostic 
groups. Importantly, most associations remained significant in Aβ-positive group 
and became non-significant in Aβ-negative group. Longitudinal analyses of plasma 
p-tau181 suggest its potential as a noninvasive biomarker to track disease 
progression in AD and to monitor effects of disease-modifying therapeutics in 
clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: In the 2018 AT(N) framework, neurodegenerative (N) biomarkers plays 
an essential role in the research and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD); 
however, the different choice of N may result in discordances.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare different potential N biomarkers.
METHODS: We examined these N biomarkers among 1,238 participants from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in their 1) diagnostic 
utility, 2) cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations between different N 
biomarkers and clinical variables, and 3) the conversion risk of different N 
profiles.
RESULTS: Six neurodegenerative biomarkers changed significantly from preclinical 
AD, through prodromal AD to AD dementia stage, thus they were chosen as the 
candidate N biomarkers: hippocampal volume (HV), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), total tau (T-tau), 
plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL), CSF NFL, and CSF neurogranin (Ng). 
Results indicated that FDG-PET not only had the greatest diagnostic utility in 
differentiating AD from controls (area under the curve: FDG-PET, 0.922), but 
also had the strongest association with cognitive scores. Furthermore, FDG-PET 
positive group showed the fastest memory decline (hazard ratio: FDG-PET, 3.45), 
which was also true even in the presence of amyloid-β pathology. Moreover, we 
observed great discordances between three valuable N biomarkers (FDG-PET, HV, 
and T-tau).
CONCLUSION: These results underline the importance of using FDG-PET as N in 
terms of cognitive decline and AD conversion, followed by HV, and could be a 
great complement to the AT(N) framework.

INTRODUCTION: We describe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
Biomarker Core progress including: the Biobank; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
amyloid beta (Aβ1-42), t-tau, and p-tau181 analytical performance, definition of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) profile for plaque, and tangle burden detection and 
increased risk for progression to AD; AD disease heterogeneity; progress in 
standardization; and new studies using ADNI biofluids.
METHODS: Review publications authored or coauthored by ADNI Biomarker core 
faculty and selected non-ADNI studies to deepen the understanding and 
interpretation of CSF Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181 data.
RESULTS: CSF AD biomarker measurements with the qualified AlzBio3 immunoassay 
detects neuropathologic AD hallmarks in preclinical and prodromal disease 
stages, based on CSF studies in non-ADNI living subjects followed by the autopsy 
confirmation of AD. Collaboration across ADNI cores generated the temporal 
ordering model of AD biomarkers varying across individuals because of 
genetic/environmental factors that increase/decrease resilience to AD 
pathologies.
DISCUSSION: Further studies will refine this model and enable the use of 
biomarkers studied in ADNI clinically and in disease-modifying therapeutic 
trials.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Clinical Core is 
responsible for coordination of all clinical activities at the ADNI sites, 
including project management, regulatory oversight, and site management and 
monitoring, as well as the collection of all clinical data and management of all 
study data. The Clinical Core is also charged with determining the clinical 
classifications and criteria for enrollment in evolving AD trials and enabling 
the ongoing characterization of the cross-sectional features and longitudinal 
trajectories of the ADNI cohorts with application of these findings to optimal 
clinical trial designs. More than 2400 individuals have been enrolled in the 
cohorts since the inception of ADNI, facilitating refinement of our 
understanding of the AD trajectory and allowing academic and industry 
investigators to model therapeutic trials across the disease spectrum from the 
presymptomatic stage through dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Since 2004, the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Clinical Core has overseen the enrollment 
of > 2400 participants with mild cognitive impairment, mild Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) dementia, and normal cognition. The longitudinal dataset has elucidated the 
full cognitive and clinical trajectory of AD from its presymptomatic stage 
through the onset of dementia. The ADNI data have supported the design of most 
major trials in the field.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid plaque and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles are 
important features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship 
between these processes is still debated.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate local and distant relationships between tau 
and amyloid deposition in the cortex in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD 
using PET imaging.
METHODS: Seventy-nine subjects (51 controls, 13 amyloid-positive MCI subjects, 
and 15 amyloid positive AD subjects) underwent MRI and 18F-flutemetamol PET. All 
MCI/AD subjects and 8 healthy controls as well as 33 healthy control subjects 
from the ADNI dataset also had 18F-AV1451 PET. Regional and distant correlations 
were examined after sampling target-to-cerebellar ratio images. Biological 
parametric mapping was used to evaluate voxel level correlations locally.
RESULTS: We found multiple clusters of voxels with highly significant positive 
correlations throughout the association cortex in both MCI and AD subjects.
CONCLUSION: The multiple clusters of positive correlations indicate that tau and 
amyloid may interact locally and be involved in disease progression. Our 
findings suggest that targeting both pathologies may be required.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is defined by β-amyloid (Aβ) 
plaques and neurofibrillary tau, but Lewy bodies (LBs; 𝛼-synuclein aggregates) 
are a common co-pathology for which effective biomarkers are needed.
METHODS: A validated α-synuclein Seed Amplification Assay (SAA) was used on 
recent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 1638 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants, 78 with LB-pathology confirmation 
at autopsy. We compared SAA outcomes with neuropathology, Aβ and tau biomarkers, 
risk-factors, genetics, and cognitive trajectories.
RESULTS: SAA showed 79% sensitivity and 97% specificity for LB pathology, with 
superior performance in identifying neocortical (100%) compared to limbic (57%) 
and amygdala-predominant (60%) LB-pathology. SAA+ rate was 22%, increasing with 
disease stage and age. Higher Aβ burden but lower CSF p-tau181 associated with 
higher SAA+ rates, especially in dementia. SAA+ affected cognitive impairment in 
MCI and Early-AD who were already AD biomarker positive.
DISCUSSION: SAA is a sensitive, specific marker for LB-pathology. Its increase 
in prevalence with age and AD stages, and its association with AD biomarkers, 
highlights the clinical importance of α-synuclein co-pathology in understanding 
AD's nature and progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: SAA shows 79% sensitivity, 97% specificity for LB-pathology 
detection in AD. SAA positivity prevalence increases with disease stage and age. 
Higher Aβ burden, lower CSF p-tau181 linked with higher SAA+ rates in dementia. 
SAA+ impacts cognitive impairment in early disease stages. Study underpins need 
for wider LB-pathology screening in AD treatment.

PURPOSE: Tau pathology progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained 
through the network degeneration hypothesis and the neuropathological Braak 
stages; however, the compatibility of these models remains unclear.
METHODS: We utilized [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET scans of 39 subjects with AD and 39 
sex-matched amyloid-negative healthy controls (HC) in the ADNI (Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset. The peak cluster of tau-tracer uptake 
was identified in each Braak stage of neuropathological tau deposition and used 
to create a seed-based functional connectivity network (FCN) using 198 HC 
subjects, to identify healthy networks unaffected by neurodegeneration.
RESULTS: Voxel-wise tau deposition was both significantly higher inside relative 
to outside FCNs and correlated significantly and positively with levels of 
healthy functional connectivity. Within many isolated Braak stages and regions, 
the correlation between tau and intrinsic functional connectivity was 
significantly stronger than it was across the whole brain. In this way, each 
peak cluster of tau was related to multiple Braak stages traditionally 
associated with both earlier and later stages of disease.
CONCLUSION: We show specificity of healthy FCN topography for AD-pathological 
tau as well as positive voxel-by-voxel correlations between pathological tau and 
healthy functional connectivity. We propose a model of "up- and downstream" 
functional tau progression, suggesting that tau pathology evolves along 
functional connectivity networks not only "downstream" (i.e., along the expected 
sequence of the established Braak stages) but also in part "upstream" or 
"retrograde" (i.e., against the expected sequence of the established Braak 
stages), with pathology in earlier Braak stages intensified by its functional 
relationship to later disease stages.

The elusive relationship between underlying pathology and clinical disease 
hampers diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and preventative intervention 
development. We seek to understand the relationship between two classical AD 
biomarkers, amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42) and total-tau (t-tau), and define their 
trajectories across disease development, as defined by disease onset at 
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using longitudinal data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we performed a correlation 
analysis of biomarkers CSF Aβ1-42 and t-tau, and longitudinal quantile analysis. 
Using a mixed effects model, with MCI onset as an anchor, we develop linear 
trajectories to describe the rate of change across disease development. These 
trajectories were extended through the incorporation of data from cognitively 
normal, healthy adults (aged 20-62 years) from the literature, to fit sigmoid 
curves by means of non-linear least squares estimators, to create curves 
encompassing the 50 years prior to MCI onset. A strong right-angled relationship 
between the biomarkers Aβ1-42 and t-tau is detected, implying a highly 
non-linear relationship. The rate of change of Aβ1-42 is correlated with the 
baseline concentration per quantile, reflecting a reduction in the rate of loss 
across disease within subjects. Regression models reveal significant amyloid 
loss relative to MCI onset (- 2.35 pg/mL/year), compared to minimal loss 
relative to AD onset (- 0.97 pg/mL/year). Tau accumulates consistently relative 
to MCI and AD onset, (2.05 pg/mL/year) and (2.46 pg/mL/year), respectively. The 
fitted amyloid curve shows peak loss of amyloid 8.06 years prior to MCI 
diagnosis, while t-tau exhibits peak accumulation 14.17 years following MCI 
diagnosis, with the upper limit not yet reached 30 years post diagnosis. 
Biomarker trajectories aid unbiased, objective assessment of disease 
progression. Quantitative trajectories are likely to be of use in clinical trial 
design, as they allow for a more detailed insight into the effectiveness of 
treatments designed to delay development of biological disease.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the heterogeneous etiology of suspected 
non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology (SNAP), a group of subjects with 
neurodegeneration in the absence of β-amyloid. Using antemortem MRI and 
pathological data, we investigated the etiology of SNAP and the association of 
neurodegenerative pathologies with structural medial temporal lobe (MTL) 
measures in β-amyloid-negative subjects.
METHODS: Subjects with antemortem MRI and autopsy data were selected from ADNI 
(n=63) and the University of Pennsylvania (n=156). Pathological diagnoses and 
semi-quantitative scores of MTL tau, neuritic plaques, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 
pathology and MTL structural MRI measures from antemortem T1-weighted MRI scans 
were obtained. β-amyloid status (A+/A-) was determined by CERAD score and 
neurodegeneration status (N+/N-) by hippocampal volume.
RESULTS: SNAP reflects a heterogeneous group of pathological diagnoses. In ADNI, 
SNAP (A-N+) had significantly more neuropathological diagnoses than A+N+. In the 
A- group, tau pathology was associated with hippocampal, entorhinal cortex, and 
Brodmann area 35 volume/thickness and TDP-43 pathology with hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSION: SNAP had a heterogeneous profile with more mixed pathologies than 
A+N+. Moreover, a role for TDP-43 and tau pathology in driving MTL 
neurodegeneration in the absence of β-amyloid was supported.

PET, CSF and plasma biomarkers of tau pathology may be differentially associated 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related demographic, cognitive, genetic and 
neuroimaging markers. We examined 771 participants with normal cognition, mild 
cognitive impairment or dementia from BioFINDER-2 (n = 400) and ADNI (n = 371). 
All had tau-PET ([18 F]RO948 in BioFINDER-2, [18 F]flortaucipir in ADNI) and CSF 
p-tau181 biomarkers available. Plasma p-tau181 and plasma/CSF p-tau217 were 
available in BioFINDER-2 only. Concordance between PET, CSF and plasma tau 
biomarkers ranged between 66 and 95%. Across the whole group, ridge regression 
models showed that increased CSF and plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels were 
independently of tau PET associated with higher age, and APOEɛ4-carriership and 
Aβ-positivity, while increased tau-PET signal in the temporal cortex was 
associated with worse cognitive performance and reduced cortical thickness. We 
conclude that biofluid and neuroimaging markers of tau pathology convey partly 
independent information, with CSF and plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels being 
more tightly linked with early markers of AD (especially Aβ-pathology), while 
tau-PET shows the strongest associations with cognitive and neurodegenerative 
markers of disease progression.

Understanding the complex interplay between tau, amyloid and the network in the 
spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's Disease.

Raj A, Torok J, Ranasinghe K.

INTRODUCTION: The interaction of amyloid and tau in neurodegenerative diseases 
is a central feature of AD pathophysiology. While experimental studies point to 
various interaction mechanisms, their causal direction and mode (local, remote 
or network-mediated) remain unknown in human subjects. The aim of this study was 
to compare mathematical reaction-diffusion models encoding distinct 
cross-species couplings to identify which interactions were key to model 
success.
METHODS: We tested competing mathematical models of network spread, aggregation, 
and amyloid-tau interactions on publicly available data from ADNI.
RESULTS: Although network spread models captured the spatiotemporal evolution of 
tau and amyloid in human subjects, the model including a one-way amyloid-to-tau 
aggregation interaction performed best.
DISCUSSION: This mathematical exposition of the "pas de deux" of co-evolving 
proteins provides quantitative, whole-brain support to the concept of 
amyloid-facilitated-tauopathy rather than the classic amyloid-cascade or 
pure-tau hypotheses, and helps explain certain known but poorly understood 
aspects of AD.

Understanding psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is crucial for 
advancing precision medicine and therapeutic strategies. The relationship 
between AD behavioral symptoms and asymmetry in spatial tau PET patterns is 
unknown. Braak tau progression implicates the temporal lobes early. However, the 
clinical and pathological implications of temporal tau laterality remain 
unexplored. This cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between 
temporal tau PET asymmetry and behavior assessed using the neuropsychiatric 
inventory, and composite scores for memory, executive function, and language; 
using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. 
In the entire cohort, continuous right and left temporal tau contributions to 
behavior and cognition were evaluated controlling for age, sex, education, and 
tau burden on the contralateral side. Additionally, a temporal tau laterality 
index was calculated to define "asymmetry-extreme" groups (individuals with 
laterality indices greater than two standard deviations from the mean). 858 
individuals (age=73.9±7.7 years, 434(50%) females) were included, comprising 438 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) (53.4%) and 420 impaired (CI) participants (48.9%). 
In the full cohort analysis, right temporal tau was associated with worse 
behavior (B(SE)=7.19 (2.9), p-value=0.01) and left temporal tau was associated 
with worse language (B(SE)=1.4(0.2), p-value<0.0001). Categorization into 
asymmetry-extreme groups revealed 20 right- and 27 left-asymmetric participants. 
Within these extreme groups, four patterns of tau PET uptake were observed: 
anterior temporal, typical AD, typical AD with frontal involvement, and 
posterior. Asymmetrical tau burden is associated with distinct behavioral and 
cognitive profiles. Behavioral and socioemotional measures are needed to 
understand right-sided asymmetry in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma markers have been reported to be associated with brain 
amyloid burden, tau pathology, or neurodegeneration. We aimed to evaluate 
whether plasma biomarker profiles could predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathology and clinical progression in older adults without dementia.
METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data of participants enrolled in this 
study were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Plasma 
amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio was selected as the marker for amyloid 
pathology, p-tau181 for tau pathology, and neurofilament light for 
neurodegeneration. Cut-offs for these plasma markers were calculated with 
well-established positron emission tomography and structural imaging biomarkers 
as reference. Older adults without dementia were categorized into eight groups 
at baseline by plasma amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) cut-offs. Clinical 
progression was analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and Cox proportional 
hazard models.
RESULTS: A total of 183 participants (97 cognitively normal [CN] subjects and 86 
patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]; mean age 72.6 years, and 48.1% 
men) were included. Participants with A+ had significantly higher proportions of 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene ɛ4 carriers than those with A-. Brain atrophy was 
observed in all groups of CN, whereas cognition decline was obvious in the 
A+T+N+ group. Compared to A-T-N-, MCI patients with A+T+N+ had faster cognition 
worsening and faster brain atrophy. In the whole cohort, A+T+N+ and A+T+N- 
participants were at higher risk of clinical progression.
DISCUSSION: Plasma A/T/N biomarker profiles may predict AD pathology and 
clinical progression, indicating a potential role for plasma biomarkers in 
clinical trials. More research is warranted to develop a robust plasma AD 
framework.

INTRODUCTION: Practice effects (PEs) on cognitive tests obscure decline, thereby 
delaying detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Importantly, PEs may be 
present even when there are performance declines, if scores would have been even 
lower without prior test exposure. We assessed how accounting for PEs using a 
replacement-participants method impacts incident MCI diagnosis.
METHODS: Of 889 baseline cognitively normal (CN) Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants, 722 returned 1 year later (mean 
age = 74.9 ± 6.8 at baseline). The scores of test-naïve demographically matched 
"replacement" participants who took tests for the first time were compared to 
returnee scores at follow-up. PEs-calculated as the difference between returnee 
follow-up scores and replacement participants scores-were subtracted from 
follow-up scores of returnees. PE-adjusted cognitive scores were then used to 
determine if individuals were below the impairment threshold for MCI. 
Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, and total tau were used 
for criterion validation. In addition, based on screening and recruitment 
numbers from a clinical trial of amyloid-positive individuals, we estimated the 
effect of earlier detection of MCI by accounting for cognitive PEs on a 
hypothetical clinical trial in which the key outcome was progression to MCI.
RESULTS: In the ADNI sample, PE-adjusted scores increased MCI incidence by 19% 
(P < .001), increased proportion of amyloid-positive MCI cases (+12%), and 
reduced proportion of amyloid-positive CNs (-5%; P's < .04). Additional 
calculations showed that the earlier detection and increased MCI incidence would 
also substantially reduce necessary sample size and study duration for a 
clinical trial of progression to MCI. Cost savings were estimated at ≈$5.41 
million.
DISCUSSION: Detecting MCI as early as possible is of obvious importance. 
Accounting for cognitive PEs with the replacement-participants method leads to 
earlier detection of MCI, improved diagnostic accuracy, and can lead to 
multi-million-dollar cost reductions for clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning is a promising tool for biomarker-based diagnosis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Performing multimodal feature selection and 
studying the interaction between biological and clinical AD can help to improve 
the performance of the diagnosis models.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to formulate a feature ranking metric based on the 
mutual information index to assess the relevance and redundancy of regional 
biomarkers and improve the AD classification accuracy.
METHODS: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 722 
participants with three modalities, including florbetapir-PET, flortaucipir-PET, 
and MRI, were studied. The multivariate mutual information metric was utilized 
to capture the redundancy and complementarity of the predictors and develop a 
feature ranking approach. This was followed by evaluating the capability of 
single-modal and multimodal biomarkers in predicting the cognitive stage.
RESULTS: Although amyloid-β deposition is an earlier event in the disease 
trajectory, tau PET with feature selection yielded a higher early-stage 
classification F1-score (65.4%) compared to amyloid-β PET (63.3%) and MRI 
(63.2%). The SVC multimodal scenario with feature selection improved the 
F1-score to 70.0% and 71.8% for the early and late-stage, respectively. When age 
and risk factors were included, the scores improved by 2 to 4%. The 
Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration [AT(N)] framework helped to interpret the 
classification results for different biomarker categories.
CONCLUSION: The results underscore the utility of a novel feature selection 
approach to reduce the dimensionality of multimodal datasets and enhance model 
performance. The AT(N) biomarker framework can help to explore the misclassified 
cases by revealing the relationship between neuropathological biomarkers and 
cognition.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) associations with global 
cognition and memory are clear, but the link between p-tau181 with other 
cognitive domains and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) across the clinical 
spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how this association changes based on 
genetic and demographic factors is poorly understood.
METHODS: Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and included 1185 adults >55 years of age with plasma p-tau181 
and neuropsychological test data. Linear regression models related plasma 
p-tau181 to neuropsychological composite and SCD scores with follow-up models 
examining plasma p-tau181 interactions with cognitive diagnosis, apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) ε4 carrier status, age, and sex on cognitive outcomes.
RESULTS: Higher plasma p-tau181 level was associated with worse memory, 
executive functioning, and language abilities, and greater informant-reported 
SCD. Visuospatial abilities and self-report SCD were not associated with plasma 
p-tau181. Associations were generally stronger in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) or dementia, APOE ε4 carriers, women, and younger participants.
DISCUSSION: Higher levels of plasma p-tau181 are associated with worse 
neuropsychological test performance across multiple cognitive domains; however, 
these associations vary based on disease stage, genetic risk status, age, and 
sex.
HIGHLIGHTS: Greater plasma p-tau181 was associated with lower cognition across 
most domains.Associations between p-tau181 and cognition were modified by age 
and sex.Level of p-tau181 was more strongly associated with cognition in people 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has 
continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and 
has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified 
researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data 
during 2014 and 2015.
METHODS: We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data.
RESULTS: (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to 
hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and 
disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects 
before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal β-amyloid deposition 
(Aβ+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade 
hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than Aβ 
deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with Aβ to increase 
white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of 
atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may 
underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network 
connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of 
Aβ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical Aβ deposition 
and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci 
have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively 
normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and 
include groups typified not only by "classic" AD pathology but also by normal 
biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) 
Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more 
pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive 
outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate 
outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may 
further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine 
learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and 
prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) 
Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal 
classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling 
multimodal classifiers.
DISCUSSION: Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding 
of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and 
improves clinical trial design.

OBJECTIVES: The trail making test part B (TMT-B) evaluates executive functions, 
memory, and sensorimotor functions. No previous study was found to examine the 
longitudinal effect of APOE-ε4 genotypes on the TMT-B scores in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) across racial groups.
METHODS: This study used the data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI): 382 participants with AD, 503 with cognitive normal (CN), 
1293 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and follow-up of four 
years. The multivariable linear mixed model was used to investigate the effect 
of APOE-ε4 genotypes on changes in TMT-B scores.
RESULTS: Compared with Whites, African Americans (AA) and Hispanics had higher 
TMT-B scores (poor cognitive function). Furthermore, Whites subjects with 1 or 2 
APOE-ε4 alleles had significantly higher TMT-B scores compared with individuals 
without APOE-ε4 allele at baseline and four follow-up visits; however, no 
differences in TMT-B were found between APOE-ε4 alleles in the Hispanic and AA 
groups. No APOE-ε4 by visit interactions was found for 3 racial groups. 
Stratified by AD diagnosis, the APOE-ε4 allele was associated with TMT-B scores 
only in the MCI group, while there were significant interactions for visit by 
education, APOE-ε4 allele, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in 
the MCI group. In addition, TMT-B was significantly correlated with the MMSE, AD 
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS13), tTau, pTau, Aβ42, and 
hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE-ɛ4 allele is associated with TMT-B scores in Whites subjects, 
but not in the Hispanic and AA groups. APOE-ε4 showed interaction with visit in 
the MCI group.

BACKGROUND: A putative role for iron in driving Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression is complicated by previously reported associations with 
neuroinflammation, apolipoprotein E and AD proteinopathy. To establish how iron 
interacts with clinicopathological features of AD and at what disease stage iron 
influences cognitive outcomes, we investigated the association of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers of iron (ferritin), inflammation (acute phase response 
proteins) and apolipoproteins with pathological biomarkers (CSF Aβ42/t-tau, 
p-tau181), clinical staging and longitudinal cognitive deterioration in subjects 
from the BioFINDER cohort, with replication of key results in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: Ferritin, acute phase response proteins (n=9) and apolipoproteins (n=6) 
were measured in CSF samples from BioFINDER (n=1239; 4 years cognitive 
follow-up) participants stratified by cognitive status (cognitively unimpaired, 
mild cognitive impairment, AD) and for the presence of amyloid and tangle 
pathology using CSF Aβ42/t-tau (A+) and p-tau181 (T+). The ferritin and 
apolipoprotein E associations were replicated in the ADNI (n=264) cohort.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, ferritin and apoE were elevated in A-T+ and A+T+ 
subjects (16%-40%), but not clinical diagnosis. Other apolipoproteins and acute 
phase response proteins increased with clinical diagnosis, not pathology. CSF 
ferritin was positively associated with p-tau181, which was mediated by 
apolipoprotein E. An optimised threshold of ferritin predicted cognitive 
deterioration in mild cognitive impairment subjects in the BioFINDER cohort, 
especially those people classified as A-T- and A+T-.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF markers of iron and neuroinflammation have distinct 
associations with disease stages, while iron may be more intimately associated 
with apolipoprotein E and tau pathology.

BACKGROUND: Financial capacity is often one of the first instrumental activities 
of daily living to be affected in cognitively normal (CN) older adults who later 
progress to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association 
between financial capacity and regional cerebral tau.
METHODS: Cross-sectional financial capacity was assessed using the Financial 
Capacity Instrument -Short Form (FCI-SF) in 410 CN, 199 MCI, and 61 AD dementia 
participants who underwent flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Linear regression models 
with backward elimination were used with FCI-SF total score as the dependent 
variable and regional tau and tau-amyloid interaction as predictors of interest 
in separate analyses. Education, age, sex, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
Total Learning, and Trail Making Test B were used as covariates.
RESULTS: Significant associations were found between FCI-SF and tau regions 
(entorhinal: p < 0.001; inferior temporal: p < 0.001; dorsolateral prefrontal: 
p = 0.01; posterior cingulate: p = 0.03; precuneus: p < 0.001; and supramarginal 
gyrus: p = 0.005) across all participants. For the tau-amyloid interaction, 
significant associations were found in four regions (amyloid and dorsolateral 
prefrontal tau interaction: p = 0.005; amyloid and posterior cingulate tau 
interaction: p = 0.005; amyloid and precuneus tau interaction: p < 0.001; and 
amyloid and supramarginal tau interaction: p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Greater regional tau burden was modestly associated with financial 
capacity impairment in early-stage AD. Extending this work with longitudinal 
analyses will further illustrate the utility of such assessments in detecting 
clinically meaningful decline, which may aid clinical trials of early-stage AD.

The development of tau-PET allows paired helical filament tau pathology to be 
visualized in vivo. Increased knowledge about conditions affecting the rate of 
tau accumulation could guide the development of therapies halting the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the factors modifying the rate of 
tau accumulation over time in Alzheimer's disease are still largely unknown. 
Large-scale longitudinal cohort studies, adjusting for baseline tau load, are 
needed to establish such risk factors. In the present longitudinal study, 419 
participants from four cohorts in the USA (Avid 05e, n = 157; Expedition-3, 
n = 82; ADNI, n = 123) and Sweden (BioFINDER, n = 57) were scanned repeatedly 
with tau-PET. The study participants were cognitively unimpaired (n = 153), or 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 139) or Alzheimer's disease 
dementia (n = 127). Participants underwent two to four tau-PET 
(18F-flortaucipir) scans with a mean (± standard deviation) of 537 (±163) days 
between the first and last scan. The change in tau-PET signal was estimated in 
temporal meta- and neocortical regions of interest. Subject specific tau-PET 
slopes were predicted simultaneously by age, sex, amyloid status (determined by 
amyloid-β PET), APOE ε4 genotype, study cohort, diagnosis and baseline tau load. 
We found that accelerated increase in tau-PET signal was observed in 
amyloid-β-positive mild cognitive impairment (3.0 ± 5.3%) and Alzheimer's 
disease dementia (2.9 ± 5.7%), respectively, when compared to either 
amyloid-β-negative cognitively unimpaired (0.4 ± 2.7%), amyloid-β-negative mild 
cognitive impairment (-0.4 ± 2.3%) or amyloid-β-positive cognitively unimpaired 
(1.2 ± 2.8%). Tau-PET uptake was accelerated in females (temporal region of 
interest: t = 2.86, P = 0.005; neocortical region of interest: t = 2.90, 
P = 0.004), younger individuals (temporal region of interest: t = -2.49, 
P = 0.013), and individuals with higher baseline tau-PET signal (temporal region 
of interest: t = 3.83, P < 0.001; neocortical region of interest: t = 5.01, 
P < 0.001). Tau-PET slopes decreased with age in amyloid-β-positive subjects, 
but were stable by age in amyloid-β-negative subjects (age × amyloid-β status 
interaction: t = -2.39, P = 0.018). There were no effects of study cohort or 
APOE ε4 positivity. In a similar analysis on longitudinal amyloid-β-PET (in ADNI 
subjects only, n = 639), we found significant associations between the rate of 
amyloid-β accumulation and APOE ε4 positivity, older age and baseline amyloid-β 
positivity, but no effect of sex. In conclusion, in this longitudinal PET study 
comprising four cohorts, we found that the tau accumulation rate is greater in 
females and younger amyloid-β-positive individuals, while amyloid-β accumulation 
is greater in APOE ε4 carriers and older individuals. These findings are 
important considerations for the design of clinical trials, and might improve 
our understanding of factors associated with faster tau aggregation and spread.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether plasma tau is altered in Alzheimer disease (AD) and 
whether it is related to changes in cognition, CSF biomarkers of AD pathology 
(including β-amyloid [Aβ] and tau), brain atrophy, and brain metabolism.
METHODS: This was a study of plasma tau in prospectively followed patients with 
AD (n = 179), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 195), and cognitive 
healthy controls (n = 189) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) and cross-sectionally studied patients with AD (n = 61), mild cognitive 
impairment (n = 212), and subjective cognitive decline (n = 174) and controls (n 
= 274) from the Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and 
Reliably (BioFINDER) study at Lund University, Sweden. A total of 1284 
participants were studied. Associations were tested between plasma tau and 
diagnosis, CSF biomarkers, MRI measures, 18fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and 
cognition.
RESULTS: Higher plasma tau was associated with AD dementia, higher CSF tau, and 
lower CSF Aβ42, but the correlations were weak and differed between ADNI and 
BioFINDER. Longitudinal analysis in ADNI showed significant associations between 
plasma tau and worse cognition, more atrophy, and more hypometabolism during 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma tau partly reflects AD pathology, but the overlap between 
normal aging and AD is large, especially in patients without dementia. Despite 
group-level differences, these results do not support plasma tau as an AD 
biomarker in individual people. Future studies may test longitudinal plasma tau 
measurements in AD.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFITM3, 
an innate immunity gene and modulator of amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), for association with cognition and AD biomarkers.
METHODS: We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI; N = 1565) and AddNeuroMed (N = 633) as discovery and replication samples, 
respectively. We performed gene-based association analysis of SNPs in IFITM3 
with cognitive performance and SNP-based association analysis with cognitive 
decline and amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers for AD.
RESULTS: Gene-based association analysis showed that IFITM3 was significantly 
associated with cognitive performance. Particularly, rs10751647 in IFITM3 was 
associated with less cognitive decline, less amyloid and tau burden, and less 
brain atrophy in ADNI. The association of rs10751647 with cognitive decline and 
brain atrophy was replicated in AddNeuroMed.
DISCUSSION: This suggests that rs10751647 in IFITM3 is associated with less 
vulnerability for cognitive decline and AD biomarkers, providing mechanistic 
insight regarding involvement of immunity and infection in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: IFITM3 is significantly associated with cognitive 
performance.rs10751647 in IFITM3 is associated with cognitive decline rates with 
replication.rs10751647 is associated with amyloid beta load, cerebrospinal fluid 
phosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy.rs10751647 is associated with 
IFITM3 expression levels in blood and brain.rs10751647 in IFITM3 is related to 
less vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Females represent approximately 70% of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
cases and the literature has proposed a connection between the decreased 
estrogen levels during menopause and an increased AD risk. Previous 
investigations have predominantly focused on assessing how hormone therapy (HT) 
affects the likelihood of AD development and cognitive deterioration. However, 
as the research framework has shifted toward a biomarker-defined AD and 
alterations in specific biomarkers could take place years before cognitive 
decline becomes discernible, it is crucial to examine how HT influences AD 
biomarkers. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of HT on AD 
biomarker-informed pathophysiology in both cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 
cognitively impaired (CI) post-menopausal females across the aging and AD 
spectrum.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included post-menopausal females without HT 
history (HT-) and with HT (HT+) at the time of PET imaging assessment from two 
cohorts: the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort, and 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants underwent 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and 
biofluid collection. Voxel-based t-tests were performed to assess the 
differences in amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) loads 
between HT- and HT + females. Linear regression models with interaction terms 
were also conducted to examine the interactive effects of HT and Aβ-PET on 
regional tau-PET.
RESULTS: HT + females demonstrated significantly lower tau-PET standardized 
uptake value ratio (SUVR) in Braak I-II ROIs (P < 0.05, Hedges' g = 0.73), Braak 
III-IV ROIs (P < 0.0001, Hedges' g = 0.74) and Braak V-VI ROIs (P < 0.0001, 
Hedges' g = 0.69) compared to HT- females. HT + females also showed 
significantly lower CSF p-tau181 (P < 0.001) and plasma p-tau181 (P < 0.0001) 
concentrations. Additionally, results from multivariate linear regression models 
indicated that HT interacts with cortical Aβ and is associated with lower 
regional NFT load.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings from this observational study suggest that HT is 
associated with lower tau neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in postmenopausal 
females. Due to the close link between tau and cognition, this study highlights 
the need for large randomized controlled trials designed to systemically study 
the influences of HT on AD biomarkers and disease progression.

BACKGROUND: The way to evaluate brain tau pathology in vivo is tau positron 
emission tomography (tau-PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. In the 
clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a proportion of tau-PET 
are negative. Interest in less expensive and convenient ways to detect tau 
pathology in Alzheimer's disease has increased due to the high cost of tau-PET 
and the invasiveness of lumbar puncture, which typically slows down the cost and 
enrollment of clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate one simple and effective method in predicting 
tau-PET status in MCI individuals.
METHODS: The sample included 154 individuals which were dichotomized into 
tau-PET (+) and tau-PET (-) using a cut-off of >1.33. We used stepwise 
regression to select the unitary or combination of variables that best predicted 
tau-PET. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the 
accuracy of single and multiple clinical markers.
RESULTS: The combined performance of three variables [Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13), Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), ADNI-Memory summary score (ADNI-MEM)] in neurocognitive 
measures demonstrated good predictive accuracy of tau-PET status 
[accuracy = 85.7%, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.879]. The combination of 
clinical markers model (APOEɛ4, neurocognitive measures and structural MRI 
imaging of middle temporal) had the best discriminative power (AUC = 0.946).
CONCLUSION: As a noninvasive test, the combination of APOEɛ4, neurocognitive 
measures and structural MRI imaging of middle temporal accurately predicts 
tau-PET status. The finding may provide a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for 
clinical application in predicting tau pathology among MCI individuals.

BACKGROUND: The role of α-synuclein in dementia has been recognized, yet its 
exact influence on cognitive decline in non-demented older adults is still not 
fully understood.
METHODS: A total of 331 non-demented individuals were included in the study from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants were 
divided into two distinct groups based on their α-synuclein levels: one with 
lower levels (α-synuclein-L) and another with higher levels (α-synuclein-H). 
Measurements included neuropsychiatric scales, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarkers, and blood transcriptomics. The linear mixed-effects model 
investigated the longitudinal changes in cognition. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model were utilized to evaluate the 
effects of different levels of α-synuclein on dementia. Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) was utilized to investigate the biological pathways related to 
cognitive impairment. Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression models, 
and mediation analysis were employed to investigate the relationship between 
α-synuclein and neurodegenerative biomarkers, and their potential mechanisms 
affecting cognition.
RESULTS: Higher CSF α-synuclein levels were associated with increased risk of 
cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Enrichment analysis highlighted 
the activation of tau-associated and immune response pathways in the 
α-synuclein-H group. Further correlation and regression analysis indicated that 
the CSF α-synuclein levels were positively correlated with CSF total tau 
(t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 
(TNFR1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Mediation analysis 
further elucidated that the detrimental effects of CSF α-synuclein on cognition 
were primarily mediated through CSF t-tau and p-tau. Additionally, it was 
observed that CSF α-synuclein influenced CSF t-tau and p-tau181 levels via 
inflammatory pathways involving CSF TNFR1 and ICAM-1.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings elucidate a significant connection between elevated 
levels of CSF α-synuclein and the progression of cognitive decline, highlighting 
the critical roles of activated inflammatory pathways and tau pathology in this 
association. They underscore the importance of monitoring CSF α-synuclein levels 
as a promising biomarker for identifying individuals at increased risk of 
cognitive deterioration and developing dementia.

BACKGROUND: A decline in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 
correlates with the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and has been associated with frontal and 
parietal hypometabolism, lower cerebrospinal fluid amyloid β1-42, and inferior 
temporal cortical thinning. Identifying the underlying biomarkers of functional 
decline will allow for the early identification of individuals at risk of 
disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between IADL impairment and in vivo 
regional cerebral tau and cortical amyloid deposition across clinically normal 
(CN) elderly, MCI, and AD dementia.
METHODS: Fifty-one CN elderly, 30 MCI, and 9 AD dementia participants of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent assessment of 
regional tau deposition with flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography 
(PET). An aggregate of cortical amyloid burden was assessed by florbetapir PET. 
IADL were assessed using the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Tau 
regions with unadjusted correlations of p ≤ 0.006 (Bonferroni correction) with 
FAQ were used to evaluate the cross-sectional association between FAQ (dependent 
variable) and regional cerebral tau deposition, amyloid burden, and tau-amyloid 
interaction in separate general linear regression models with backward 
elimination. Covariates included age, American National Adult Reading Test 
(AMNART) intelligence quotient (IQ), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) total learning.
RESULTS: Unadjusted correlations between FAQ and tau in the entorhinal cortex 
(EC) and inferior temporal cortex (IT) survived Bonferroni correction. FAQ was 
associated with the tau-amyloid interaction, such that in participants with 
greater amyloid burden, greater IADL impairment was associated with greater 
regional tau (EC tau × amyloid: partial r (pr) = 0.47, p < 0.001; IT tau × 
amyloid: pr = 0.54, p < 0.001). Significant associations were found when these 
regression models were repeated in symptomatic participants alone but not among 
CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater medial and inferior temporal tau and cortical amyloid 
burden were associated with greater IADL impairment in AD. Further elucidation 
of the biomarkers underlying the functional decline will allow for the early 
identification of individual at risk of disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Total tau protein (T-Tau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) have 
emerged as candidate plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration, but studies have 
not compared how these biomarkers cross-sectionally or longitudinally associate 
with cognitive and neuroimaging measures. We therefore compared plasma T-Tau and 
NfL as cross-sectional and longitudinal markers of (1) global and 
domain-specific cognitive decline and (2) neuroimaging markers of cortical 
thickness, hippocampal volume, white matter integrity, and white matter 
hyperintensity volume.
METHODS: We included 995 participants without dementia who were enrolled in the 
Mayo Clinic Study of Aging cohort. All had concurrent plasma NfL and T-tau, 
cognitive status, and neuroimaging data. Follow-up was repeated approximately 
every 15 months for a median of 6.2 years. Plasma NfL and T-tau were measured on 
the Simoa-HD1 Platform. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, and 
education examined associations between baseline z-scored plasma NfL or T-tau 
and cognitive or neuroimaging outcomes. Analyses were replicated in Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) among 387 participants without dementia 
followed for a median of 3.0 years.
RESULTS: At baseline, plasma NfL was more strongly associated with all cognitive 
and neuroimaging outcomes. The combination of having both elevated NfL and T-tau 
at baseline, compared to elevated levels of either alone, was more strongly 
associated at cross-section with worse global cognition and memory, and with 
neuroimaging measures including temporal cortex thickness and increased number 
of infarcts. In longitudinal analyses, baseline plasma T-tau did not add to the 
prognostic value of baseline plasma NfL. Results using ADNI data were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate plasma NfL had better utility as a prognostic 
marker of cognitive decline and neuroimaging changes. Plasma T-tau added 
cross-sectional value to NfL in specific contexts.

Latest research in the mental health field brings new hope to patients and 
promises to revolutionize the field of psychiatry. Personalized pharmacogenetic 
tests that aid in diagnosis and treatment choice are now becoming available for 
clinical practice. Amyloid beta peptide biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease are now available. For the first time, 
radiologists are able to visualize amyloid plaques specific to Alzheimer's 
disease in live patients using Positron Emission Tomography-based tests approved 
by the FDA. A novel blood-based assay has been developed to aid in the diagnosis 
of depression based on activation of the HPA axis, metabolic, inflammatory and 
neurochemical pathways. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown increased 
remission rates in specific ethnic subgroups and Cytochrome P450 gene 
polymorphisms can predict antidepressant tolerability. The latest research will 
help to eradicate "trial and error" prescription, ushering in the most 
personalized medicine to date. Like all major medical breakthroughs, integration 
of new algorithms and technologies requires sound science and time. But for many 
mentally ill patients, diagnosis and effective therapy cannot happen fast 
enough. This review will describe the newest diagnostic tests, treatments and 
clinical studies for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and 
unipolar, major depressive disorder.

BACKGROUND: Glymphatic dysfunction may contribute to the accumulation of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies. Conversely, AD pathologic change might 
also cause neuroinflammation and aggravate glymphatic dysfunction, forming a 
loop that accelerates AD progression. In vivo validations are needed to confirm 
their relationships.
METHODS: In this study, we included 144 cognitively normal participants with AD 
pathological biomarker data (baseline CSF Aβ1-42, T-Tau, P-Tau181; plasma 
P-Tau181 at baseline and at least one follow-up) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Each subject had completed structural 
MRI scans. Among them, 117 subjects have available neuroinflammatory biomarker 
(soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and 123 
subjects have completed two times [18F]-florbetapir PET. The enlarged PVS (EPVS) 
visual rating scores in basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CS) were 
assessed on T1-weighted images to reflect glymphatic dysfunction. Intracranial 
volume and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume were also calculated for 
further analysis. We performed stepwise linear regression models and mediation 
analyses to estimate the association between EPVS severity, sTREM2, and AD 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: CS-EPVS degree was associated with CSF sTREM2, annual change of plasma 
P-tau181 and total WMH volume, whereas BG-EPVS severity was associated with age, 
gender and intracranial volume. The sTREM2 mediated the association between CSF 
P-tau181 and CS-EPVS.
CONCLUSION: Impaired glymphatic dysfunction could contribute to the accumulation 
of pathological tau protein. The association between tauopathy and glymphatic 
dysfunction was mediated by the microglia inflammatory process. These findings 
may provide evidence for novel treatment strategies of anti-neuroinflammation 
therapy in the early stage.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To test the associations between the presynaptic 
growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), quantified in CSF, and biomarkers of 
Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology, cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, GAP-43 was measured in participants from 
the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using an in-house ELISA method, and 
levels were compared between groups, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. 
Linear regression models tested the associations between biomarkers of AD 
(amyloid beta [Aβ] and tau pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognition) 
adjusted by age, sex, and diagnosis. Linear mixed-effect models evaluated how 
baseline GAP-43 predicts brain hypometabolism, atrophy, and cognitive decline 
over time. Cox proportional hazard regression models tested how GAP-43 levels 
and Aβ status, at baseline, increased the risk of progression to AD dementia 
over time.
RESULTS: This study included 786 participants from the ADNI cohort, which were 
further classified in cognitively unimpaired (CU) Aβ-negative (nCU- = 197); CU 
Aβ-positive (nCU+ = 55), mild cognitively impaired (MCI) Aβ-negative (nMCI- = 
228), MCI Aβ-positive (nMCI+ = 193), and AD dementia Aβ-positive (nAD = 113). 
CSF GAP-43 levels were increased in Aβ-positive compared with Aβ-negative 
participants, independent of the cognitive status. In Aβ-positive participants, 
high baseline GAP-43 levels led to worse brain metabolic decline (p = 0.01), 
worse brain atrophy (p = 8.8 × 10-27), and worse MMSE scores (p = 0.03) over 
time, as compared with those with low GAP-43 levels. Similarly, Aβ-positive 
participants with high baseline GAP-43 had the highest risk to convert to AD 
dementia (hazard ratio [HR = 8.56, 95% CI 4.94-14.80, p = 1.5 × 10-14]). Despite 
the significant association with Aβ pathology (η2 Aβ PET = 0.09, P Aβ PET < 
0.001), CSF total tau (tTau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) had a larger effect 
size on GAP43 than Aβ PET (η2 pTau-181 = 0.53, P pTau-181 < 0.001; η2 tTau = 
0.59, P tTau < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: High baseline levels of CSF GAP-43 are associated with progression 
in Aβ-positive individuals, with a more aggressive neurodegenerative process, 
faster rate of cognitive decline, and increased risk of converting to dementia.

Tau neurofibrillary tangles, a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), exhibit a stereotypical spatiotemporal trajectory that is strongly 
correlated with disease progression and cognitive decline. Personalized 
prediction of tau progression is, therefore, vital for the early diagnosis and 
prognosis of AD. Evidence from both animal and human studies is suggestive of 
tau transmission along the brains preexisting neural connectivity conduits. We 
present here an analytic graph diffusion framework for individualized predictive 
modeling of tau progression along the structural connectome. To account for 
physiological processes that lead to active generation and clearance of tau 
alongside passive diffusion, our model uses an inhomogenous graph diffusion 
equation with a source term and provides closed-form solutions to this equation 
for linear and exponential source functionals. Longitudinal imaging data from 
two cohorts, the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) and the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were used to validate the model. The clinical 
data used for developing and validating the model include regional tau measures 
extracted from longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) scans based on 
the 18F-Flortaucipir radiotracer and individual structural connectivity maps 
computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by means of tractography and 
streamline counting. Two-timepoint tau PET scans were used to assess the 
goodness of model fit. Three-timepoint tau PET scans were used to assess 
predictive accuracy via comparison of predicted and observed tau measures at the 
third timepoint. Our results show high consistency between predicted and 
observed tau and differential tau from region-based analysis. While the 
prognostic value of this approach needs to be validated in a larger cohort, our 
preliminary results suggest that our longitudinal predictive model, which offers 
an in vivo macroscopic perspective on tau progression in the brain, is 
potentially promising as a personalizable predictive framework for AD.

Amyloid (Aβ) pathology is the earliest detectable pathophysiological event along 
the Alzheimer's continuum, which can be measured both in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) and by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Yet, these biomarkers identify 
two distinct Aβ pools, reflecting the clearance of soluble Aβ as opposed to the 
presence of Aβ fibrils in the brain. An open question is whether risk factors 
known to increase Alzheimer's' disease (AD) prevalence may promote an imbalance 
between soluble and deposited Aβ. Unveiling such interactions shall aid our 
understanding of the biological pathways underlying Aβ deposition and foster the 
design of effective prevention strategies. We assessed the impact of three major 
AD risk factors, such as age, APOE-ε4 and female sex, on the association between 
CSF and PET Aβ, in two independent samples of non-demented individuals (ALFA: 
n = 320, ADNI: n = 682). We tested our hypotheses both in candidate regions of 
interest and in the whole brain using voxel-wise non-parametric permutations. 
All of the assessed risk factors induced a higher Aβ deposition for any given 
level of CSF Aβ42/40, although in distinct cerebral topologies. While age and 
sex mapped onto neocortical areas, the effect of APOE-ε4 was prominent in the 
medial temporal lobe, which represents a target of early tau deposition. 
Further, we found that the effects of age and APOE-ε4 was stronger in women than 
in men. Our data indicate that specific AD risk factors affect the spatial 
patterns of cerebral Aβ aggregation, with APOE-ε4 possibly facilitating a 
co-localization between Aβ and tau along the disease continuum.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and has received 
considerable research attention, including using neuroimaging biomarkers to 
classify patients and/or predict disease progression. Generalized linear models, 
e.g., logistic regression, can be used as classifiers, but since the spatial 
measurements are correlated and often outnumber subjects, penalized and/or 
Bayesian models will be identifiable, while classical models often will not. 
Many useful models, e.g., the elastic net and spike-and-slab lasso, perform 
automatic variable selection, which removes extraneous predictors and reduces 
model variance, but neither model exploits spatial information in selecting 
variables. Spatial information can be incorporated into variable selection by 
placing intrinsic autoregressive priors on the logit probabilities of inclusion 
within a spike-and-slab elastic net framework. We demonstrate the ability of 
this framework to improve classification performance by using cortical thickness 
and tau-PET images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
to classify subjects as cognitively normal or having dementia, and by using a 
simulation study to examine model performance using finer resolution images.

INTRODUCTION: A major gap in amyloid-centric theories of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is that even though amyloid fibrils per se are not toxic in vitro, the 
diagnosis of AD clearly correlates with the density of beta-amyloid (Aβ) 
deposits. Based on our proposed amyloid degradation toxicity hypothesis, we 
developed a mathematical model explaining this discrepancy. It suggests that 
cytotoxicity depends on the cellular uptake of soluble Aβ rather than on the 
presence of amyloid aggregates. The dynamics of soluble beta-amyloid in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the density of Aβ deposits is described using a 
system of differential equations. In the model, cytotoxic damage is proportional 
to the cellular uptake of Aβ, while the probability of an AD diagnosis is 
defined by the Aβ cytotoxicity accumulated over the duration of the disease. 
After uptake, Aβ is concentrated intralysosomally, promoting the formation of 
fibrillation seeds inside cells. These seeds cannot be digested and are either 
accumulated intracellularly or exocytosed. Aβ starts aggregating on the 
extracellular seeds and, therefore, decreases in concentration in the 
interstitial fluid. The dependence of both Aβ toxicity and aggregation on the 
same process-cellular uptake of Aβ-explains the correlation between AD diagnosis 
and the density of amyloid aggregates in the brain.
METHODS: We tested the model using clinical data obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which included records of beta-amyloid 
concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-Aβ42) and the density of 
beta-amyloid deposits measured using positron emission tomography (PET). The 
model predicts the probability of AD diagnosis as a function of CSF-Aβ42 and PET 
and fits the experimental data at the 95% confidence level.
RESULTS: Our study shows that existing clinical data allows for the inference of 
kinetic parameters describing beta-amyloid turnover and disease progression. 
Each combination of CSF-Aβ42 and PET values can be used to calculate the 
individual's cellular uptake rate, the effective disease duration, and the 
accumulated toxicity. We show that natural limitations on these parameters 
explain the characteristic distribution of the clinical dataset for these two 
biomarkers in the population.
CONCLUSION: The resulting mathematical model interprets the positive correlation 
between the density of Aβ deposits and the probability of an AD diagnosis 
without assuming any cytotoxicity of the aggregated beta-amyloid. To the best of 
our knowledge, this model is the first to mechanistically explain the negative 
correlation between the concentration of Aβ42 in the CSF and the probability of 
an AD diagnosis. Finally, based on the amyloid degradation toxicity hypothesis 
and the insights provided by mathematical modeling, we propose new 
pathophysiology-relevant biomarkers to diagnose and predict AD.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) aims to 
validate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. To improve 
generalizability, ADNI4 aims to enroll 50-60% of its new participants from 
underrepresented populations (URPs) using new biofluid and digital technologies. 
ADNI4 has received funding from the National Institute on Aging beginning 
September 2022.
METHODS: ADNI4 will recruit URPs using community-engaged approaches. An online 
portal will screen 20,000 participants, 4000 of whom (50-60% URPs) will be 
tested for plasma biomarkers and APOE. From this, 500 new participants will 
undergo in-clinic assessment joining 500 ADNI3 rollover participants. Remaining 
participants (∼3500) will undergo longitudinal plasma and digital cognitive 
testing. ADNI4 will add MRI sequences and new PET tracers. Project 1 will 
optimize biomarkers in AD clinical trials.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ADNI4 will improve generalizability of results, use 
remote digital and blood screening, and continue providing longitudinal 
clinical, biomarker, and autopsy data to investigators.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, 
longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, 
and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; 
$67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, 
including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 
foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National 
Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the 
inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The 
major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of 
standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in 
a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of 
imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD 
patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by 
β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and 
tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and 
hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of 
change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of 
alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best 
classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, 
[(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the 
development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 
42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD 
pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading 
candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the 
improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects 
most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more 
sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI 
measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, 
whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome 
measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the 
identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the 
establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) 
understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through 
integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate 
research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the 
etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying 
drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of 
all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific 
investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year 
Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 
through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, 
longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, 
and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; 
$67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, 
including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 
foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National 
Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the 
inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The 
major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of 
standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in 
a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of 
imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD 
patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by 
β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and 
tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and 
hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of 
change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of 
alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best 
classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, 
[(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the 
development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 
42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD 
pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading 
candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the 
improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects 
most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more 
sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI 
measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, 
whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome 
measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the 
identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the 
establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) 
understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through 
integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate 
research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the 
etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying 
drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of 
all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific 
investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year 
Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 
through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.

BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are prescribed for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and sometimes for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) without knowing 
underlying pathologies and its effect on cognition. We investigated the 
frequency of ChEI prescriptions in amyloid-negative MCI and their association 
with cognitive changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
cohort.
METHODS: We included participants with amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET)-negative MCI from the ADNI. We analyzed the associations of ChEI use with 
cognitive changes, brain volume, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau 
(t-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and p-tau181/t-tau ratio.
RESULTS: ChEIs were prescribed in 27.4% of amyloid PET-negative MCI and were 
associated with faster cognitive decline, reduced baseline hippocampal volume 
and entorhinal cortical thickness, and a longitudinal decrease in the frontal 
lobe cortical thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between ChEI use and accelerated cognitive decline 
may stem from underlying pathologies involving reduced hippocampal volume, 
entorhinal cortical thickness and faster frontal lobe atrophy. We suggest that 
ChEI use in amyloid PET-negative MCI patients might need further consideration, 
and studies investigating the causality between ChEI use and cognitive decline 
are warranted in the future.

Amyloid and Tau Positivity in Alzheimer’s Disease Project Team.

Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly being used to 
assist in making an etiological diagnosis for cognitively impaired (CI) 
individuals or to identify cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals with AD 
pathology who may be eligible for prevention trials. However, a better 
understanding of the timing of plasma biomarker changes is needed to optimize 
their use in clinical and research settings. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the timing of change of key AD plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, 
p-tau181, GFAP and NfL) from six different companies, along with established AD 
biomarkers, using AD progression timelines based on amyloid and tau PET. We used 
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 784 
individuals with longitudinal 18 F-florbetapir amyloid PET and 359 individuals 
with longitudinal 18 F-flortaucipir tau PET, to estimate age at amyloid and tau 
positivity, defined as the age at the first positive PET scan. Of these, 
longitudinal plasma biomarker measures were available from 190 individuals with 
an estimated age at amyloid positivity and 70 individuals with an estimated age 
at tau positivity. Age at tau positivity was a stronger predictor of symptom 
onset than age at amyloid positivity in 17 individuals who progressed from CU to 
CI during their participation in the ADNI study (Adj R 2 = 0.86 vs. Adj R 2 = 
0.38), and therefore was used to estimate symptom onset age for all individuals 
with an estimated age at tau positivity. Generalized additive mixed models 
(GAMMs) were used to model biomarker trajectories across years since amyloid 
positivity, tau positivity, and symptom onset, and to identify the earliest 
timepoint of biomarker abnormality when compared to a reference group of 
amyloid- and tau-negative CU individuals, as well as time periods of significant 
change in biomarkers. All plasma biomarkers except NfL became abnormal prior to 
amyloid and tau positivity. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 was the first biomarker to reach 
abnormality consistently across timelines and plasma GFAP became abnormal early 
in the tau timeline. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels reached a plateau, while plasma 
p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP and NfL increased throughout disease progression. Some 
differences in the timing of change were observed across biomarker assays. The 
primary utility of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may lie in early identification of 
individuals at high risk of AD. In contrast, p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP and NfL 
increase throughout the estimated timelines, supporting their potential as 
biomarkers for staging and monitoring disease progression.

14-3-3 is a family of conserved proteins that consist of seven isoforms which 
are highly expressed in the brain, and 14-3-3 zeta(ζ) is one of the isoforms 
encoded by the YWHAZ gene. Previous studies demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ is 
deposited in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and 
that 14-3-3ζ interacts with tau from the purified neurofibrillary tangles of AD 
brain extract. The present study examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3ζ 
levels of 719 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), including cognitively normal (CN) participants, patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD dementia, and aimed to identify 
whether CSF 14-3-3ζ is associated with tau pathology. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were 
increased in AD, and particularly elevated among tau pathology positive 
individuals. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were associated with CSF phosphorylated tau 181 
(p-tau) (r = 0.741, P < 0.001) and plasma p-tau (r = 0.293, P < 0.001), which 
are fluid biomarkers of tau pathology, and could predict tau pathology positive 
status with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve [AUC], 0.891). CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were also correlated to synaptic 
biomarker CSF GAP-43 (r = 0.609, P < 0.001) and neuroinflammatory biomarker CSF 
sTREM-2 (r = 0.507, P < 0.001). High CSF 14-3-3ζ levels at baseline were 
associated with progressive decline of cognitive function and neuroimaging 
findings during follow up. In conclusion, this study suggests that CSF 14-3-3ζ 
is a potential biomarker of AD that may be useful in clinical practice.

PURPOSE: Biomarkers used for predicting longitudinal cognitive change in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum are still elusive. Tau pathology, 
neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are the leading candidate predictors. 
We aimed to determine these three aspects of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) and plasma to predict longitudinal cognition status using Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 430 subjects including, 96 cognitive normal 
(CN) with amyloid β (Aβ)-negative, 54 CN with Aβ-positive, 195 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) with Aβ-positive, and 85 AD with amyloid-positive (Aβ-positive 
are identified by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 < 0.138). Aβ burden was evaluated by CSF and 
plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio; tau pathology was evaluated by CSF and plasma 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau181); microglial activation was measured by CSF soluble 
TREM2 (sTREM2) and progranulin (PGRN); neurodegeneration was measured by CSF and 
plasma t-tau and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); cognition was 
examined annually over the subsequent 8 years using the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale Cognition 13-item scale (ADAS13) and Mini-Mental State Exam 
(MMSE). Linear mixed-effects models (LME) were applied to assess the correlation 
between biomarkers and longitudinal cognition decline, as well as their effect 
size on the prediction of longitudinal cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Baseline CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was decreased in MCI and AD compared to 
CN, while CSF p-tau181 and t-tau increased. Baseline CSF sTREM2 and PGRN did not 
show any differences in MCI and AD compared to CN. Baseline brain volumes 
(including the hippocampal, entorhinal, middle temporal lobe, and whole-brain) 
decreased in MCI and AD groups. For the longitudinal study, there were 
significant interaction effects of CSF p-tau181 × time, plasma p-tau181 × time, 
CSF sTREM2 × time, and brain volumes × time, indicating CSF, and plasma 
p-tau181, CSF sTREM2, and brain volumes could predict longitudinal cognition 
deterioration rate. CSF sTREM2, CSF, and plasma p-tau181 had similar medium 
prediction effects, while brain volumes showed stronger effects in predicting 
cognition decline.
CONCLUSION: Our study reported that baseline CSF sTREM2, CSF, and plasma 
p-tau181, as well as structural MRI, could predict longitudinal cognitive 
decline in subjects with positive AD pathology. Plasma p-tau181 can be used as a 
relatively noninvasive reliable biomarker for AD longitudinal cognition decline 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: Age-related cerebrovascular and neuroinflammatory processes have 
been independently identified as key mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
although their interactive effects have yet to be fully examined.
OBJECTIVE: The current study examined 1) the influence of pulse pressure (PP) 
and inflammatory markers on AD protein levels and 2) links between protein 
biomarkers and cognitive function in older adults with and without mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: This study included 218 ADNI (81 cognitively normal [CN], 137 MCI) 
participants who underwent lumbar punctures, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping, 
and cognitive testing. Cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of eight pro-inflammatory 
markers were used to create an inflammation composite, and amyloid-beta 1-42 
(Aβ42), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) were quantified.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, education, and APOE 
ɛ4 genotype revealed significant PP x inflammation interactions for t-tau 
(B = 0.88, p = 0.01) and p-tau (B = 0.84, p = 0.02); higher inflammation was 
associated with higher levels of tau within the MCI group. However, within the 
CN group, analyses revealed a significant PP x inflammation interaction for Aβ42 
(B = -1.01, p = 0.02); greater inflammation was associated with higher levels of 
Aβ42 (indicative of lower cerebral amyloid burden) in those with lower PP. 
Finally, higher levels of tau were associated with poorer memory performance 
within the MCI group only (p s < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: PP and inflammation exert differential effects on AD CSF proteins 
and provide evidence that vascular risk is associated with greater AD pathology 
across our sample of CN and MCI older adults.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid t-tau (CSF t-tau) is a measure of 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been increasingly 
demonstrated to be a non-specific biomarker within the AD continuum.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to test whether t-tau influences the longitudinal effects 
of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phospho-tau (p-tau) on memory and executive function (EF) 
in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: 319 MCI individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) with baseline and 2-year CSF Aβ, p-tau, t-tau, and 
neuropsychological assessments were studied. Mediation and moderation analyses 
evaluated the role of t-tau in the effects of Aβ and p-tau on memory and EF over 
2 years.
RESULTS: We found that high baseline p-tau but not Aβ was associated with higher 
t-tau and lower memory scores at 2 years follow-up. The association between 
p-tau and memory impairment was partially mediated by t-tau, whereby higher 
p-tau was indirectly associated with lower memory via higher t-tau. t-tau also 
moderated the association between p-tau and memory. When t-tau level was 
relatively lower, higher p-tau was associated with lower memory scores at 2 
years. When t-tau level was higher, the memory scores were low regardless of the 
p-tau level.
CONCLUSION: Tau-induced neurodegeneration is one key pathway by which AD 
pathology (p-tau) affects memory impairment. Furthermore, in individuals with 
lower levels of tau-induced neurodegeneration, higher levels of p-tau were 
required for memory impairment. Our findings suggest that t-tau plays a 
significant role in how early AD pathology affects cognitive outcomes.

The dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and Aβ biomarkers over time in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from prodromal pre-symptomatic to severe 
stages of dementia have not been clearly defined and recent studies, most of 
which are cross-sectional, present conflicting findings. To clarify this issue, 
we analyzed the longitudinal CSF tau and Aβ biomarker data from 142 of the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study subjects [18 AD, 74 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and 50 cognitively normal subjects (CN)]. Yearly follow-up CSF 
collections and studies were conducted for up to 48 months (median = 36 months) 
for CSF Aβ1-42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and total tau (t-tau). An 
unsupervised analysis of longitudinal measurements revealed that for Aβ1-42 and 
p-tau181 biomarkers there was a group of subjects with stable longitudinal CSF 
biomarkers measures and a group of subjects who showed a decrease (Aβ1-42, mean 
= -9.2 pg/ml/year) or increase (p-tau181, mean = 5.1 pg/ml/year) of these 
biomarker values. Low baseline Aβ1-42 values were associated with longitudinal 
increases in p-tau181. Conversely, high baseline p-tau181 values were not 
associated with changes in Aβ1-42 levels. When the subjects with normal baseline 
biomarkers and stable concentrations during follow-up were excluded, the 
expected time to reach abnormal CSF levels and the mean AD values was 
significantly shortened. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that 
there are distinct populations of ADNI subjects with abnormal longitudinal 
changes in CSF p-tau181 and Aβ1-42 levels, and our longitudinal results favor 
the hypothesis that Aβ1-42 changes precede p-tau181 changes.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) damage 
patterns in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD) and 
their effects on cognitive function.
METHODS: This study included 93 participants, 45 AD patients (14 EOAD and 31 
LOAD), and 48 normal controls (13 YNC and 35 ONC) from the ADNI database. All 
participants had diffusion tensor imaging data; some had amyloid PET and plasma 
p-tau181 data. The study used peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) 
to measure CSVD severity and compared PSMD between patients and age-matched 
controls. The effect of age on the relationship between PSMD and cognition was 
also examined. The study also repeated the analysis in amyloid-positive AD 
patients and amyloid-negative controls in another independent database (31 EOAD 
and 38 LOAD), and the merged database.
RESULTS: EOAD and LOAD showed similar cognitive function and disease severity. 
PSMD was validated as a reliable correlate of cognitive function. In the ADNI 
database, PSMD was significantly higher for LOAD and showed a tendency to 
increase for EOAD; in the independent and merged databases, PSMD was 
significantly higher for both LOAD and EOAD. The impact of PSMD on cognitive 
function was notably greater in the younger group (YNC and EOAD) than in the 
older group (ONC and LOAD), as supported by the ADNI and merged databases.
INTERPRETATION: EOAD has less CSVD burden than LOAD, but has a greater impact on 
cognition. Proactive cerebrovascular prevention strategies may have potential 
clinical value for younger older adults with cognitive decline.

INTRODUCTION: Brain structural changes in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
are poorly understood.
METHODS: We compared the changes in cortical thickness in the ADNI cohort during 
a 2-year follow-up between the NIA-AA preclinical AD stages defined by 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. We also analyzed the correlation 
between baseline CSF biomarkers and cortical atrophy rates.
RESULTS: At follow-up, stage 1 subjects showed reduced atrophy rates in medial 
frontal areas and precuneus compared to stage 0 subjects, whereas stage 2/3 
subjects presented accelerated atrophy in medial temporal structures. Low CSF 
Aβ1-42 levels were associated with reduced atrophy rates in subjects with normal 
tau levels and high CSF tau levels with accelerated atrophy only in subjects 
with low Aβ1-42 levels.
DISCUSSION: Our longitudinal data confirm a biphasic trajectory of changes in 
brain structure in preclinical AD. These have implications in AD trials, both in 
patient selection and the use of MRI as a surrogate marker of efficacy.

BACKGROUND: APOE4 has been hypothesized to increase Alzheimer's disease risk by 
increasing neuroinflammation, though the specific neuroinflammatory pathways 
involved are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Characterize cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic changes related to 
APOE4 copy number.
METHODS: We analyzed targeted proteomic data from ADNI CSF samples using a 
linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, and APOE4 copy number, and 
additional linear models also adjusting for AD clinical status or for CSF Aβ, 
tau, or p-tau levels. False discovery rate was used to correct for multiple 
comparisons correction.
RESULTS: Increasing APOE4 copy number was associated with a significant decrease 
in a CRP peptide level across all five models (q < 0.05 for each), and with 
significant increases in ALDOA, CH3L1 (YKL-40), and FABPH peptide levels 
(q < 0.05 for each) except when controlling for AD clinical status or 
neurodegeneration biomarkers (i.e., CSF tau or p-tau). In all models except the 
one controlling for CSF Aβ levels, though not statistically significant, there 
was a consistent inverse direction of association between APOE4 copy number and 
the levels of all 24 peptides from all 8 different complement proteins measured. 
The odds of this happening by chance for 24 unrelated peptides would be less 
than 1 in 16 million.
CONCLUSION: Increasing APOE4 copy number was associated with decreased CSF CRP 
levels across all models, and increased CSF ALDOA, CH3L1, and FABH levels when 
controlling for CSF Aβ levels. Increased APOE4 copy number may also be 
associated with decreased CSF complement pathway protein levels, a hypothesis 
for investigation in future studies.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, 
longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, 
and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The initial study, ADNI-1, enrolled 400 subjects with early mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 with early AD, and 200 cognitively normal 
elderly controls. ADNI-1 was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 
2009 and by a competitive renewal, ADNI-2, which enrolled an additional 550 
participants and will run until 2015. This article reviews all papers published 
since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results to the end of 
2013. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the 
development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates 
of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI 
patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are largely consistent with disease 
trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimer's Dis 
2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, 
whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but 
exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) 
the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, 
the best classifiers select and combine optimum features from multiple 
modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, amyloid PET, CSF 
biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of blood biomarkers for AD 
as potentially noninvasive and low-cost alternatives to CSF biomarkers for AD 
diagnosis and the assessment of α-syn as an additional biomarker; (5) the 
development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 
42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD 
pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects and are leading 
candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (6) the 
improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects 
most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more 
sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Multimodal methods 
incorporating APOE status and longitudinal MRI proved most highly predictive of 
future decline. Refinements of clinical tests used as outcome measures such as 
clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes further reduced sample sizes; (7) the 
pioneering of genome-wide association studies that leverage quantitative imaging 
and biomarker phenotypes, including longitudinal data, to confirm recently 
identified loci, CR1, CLU, and PICALM and to identify novel AD risk loci; (8) 
worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Japan, 
Australia, Argentina, Taiwan, China, Korea, Europe, and Italy; (9) understanding 
the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of 
ADNI biomarker and clinical data to stimulate research that will resolve 
controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby 
advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (10) the 
establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data 
without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) beginning in October 
2004, is a 6-year research project that studies changes of cognition, function, 
brain structure and function, and biomarkers in elderly controls, subjects with 
mild cognitive impairment, and subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A major 
goal is to determine and validate MRI, PET images, and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF)/blood biomarkers as predictors and outcomes for use in clinical trials of 
AD treatments. Structural MRI, FDG PET, C-11 Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) PET, 
CSF measurements of amyloid beta (Abeta) and species of tau, with 
clinical/cognitive measurements were performed on elderly controls, subjects 
with mild cognitive impairment, and subjects with AD. Structural MRI shows high 
rates of brain atrophy, and has high statistical power for determining treatment 
effects. FDG PET, C-11 Pittsburgh compound B PET, and CSF measurements of Abeta 
and tau were significant predictors of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. All 
data are available at UCLA/LONI/ADNI, without embargo. ADNI-like projects 
started in Australia, Europe, Japan, and Korea. ADNI provides significant new 
information concerning the progression of AD.

The Worldwide Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) is a 
collaborative effort to investigate imaging and biofluid markers that can inform 
Alzheimer's disease treatment trials. It is a public-private partnership that 
spans North America, Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
and Taiwan. In 2004, ADNI researchers began a naturalistic, longitudinal study 
that continues today around the globe. Through several successive phases 
(ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3), the study has fueled amyloid and tau 
phenotyping and refined neuroimaging methodologies. WW-ADNI researchers have 
successfully standardized analyses and openly share data without embargo, 
providing a rich data set for other investigators. On August 26, 2020, the 
Alzheimer's Association convened WW-ADNI researchers who shared updates from 
ADNI-3 and their vision for ADNI-4.

Nuclear DNA has been the main source of genome-wide loci association in 
neurodegenerative diseases, only partially accounting for the heritability of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this context, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is gaining 
more attention. Here, we investigated mitochondrial genes and genetic variants 
that may influence mild cognitive impairment and AD, through an integrative 
analysis including differential gene expression and mitochondrial genome-wide 
epistasis. We assessed the expression of mitochondrial genes in different brain 
tissues from two public RNA-Seq databases (GEO and GTEx). Then, we analyzed 
mtDNA from the ADNI Cohort and investigated epistasis regarding mitochondrial 
variants and levels of Aβ1-42, TAU, and Phosphorylated TAU (PTAU) from 
cognitively healthy controls, and both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD 
cases. We identified multiple differentially expressed mitochondrial genes in 
the comparisons between cognitively healthy individuals and AD patients. We also 
found increased protein levels in MCI and AD patients when compared to healthy 
controls, as well as novel candidate networks of mtDNA epistasis, which included 
variants in all mitochondrially-encoded oxidative phosphorylation complexes, 12S 
rRNA and MT-DLOOP. Our results highlight layers of potential interactions 
involving mitochondrial genetics and suggest specific molecular alterations as 
potential biomarkers for AD.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), younger symptom onset is associated with 
accelerated disease progression and tau spreading, yet the mechanisms underlying 
faster disease manifestation are unknown. To address this, we combined 
resting-state fMRI and longitudinal tau-PET in two independent samples of 
controls and biomarker-confirmed AD patients (ADNI/BioFINDER, n = 240/57). 
Consistent across both samples, we found that younger symptomatic AD patients 
showed stronger tau-PET in globally connected fronto-parietal hubs, i.e., 
regions that are critical for maintaining cognition in AD. Stronger tau-PET in 
hubs predicted faster subsequent tau accumulation, suggesting that tau in 
globally connected regions facilitates connectivity-mediated tau spreading. 
Further, stronger tau-PET in hubs mediated the association between younger age 
and faster tau accumulation in symptomatic AD patients, which predicted faster 
cognitive decline. These independently validated findings suggest that younger 
AD symptom onset is associated with stronger tau pathology in brain hubs, and 
accelerated tau spreading throughout connected brain regions and cognitive 
decline.

OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal tau quantification may provide a useful marker of drug 
efficacy in clinical trials. Different tau PET tracers may have different 
sensitivity to longitudinal changes, but without a head-to-head dataset or a 
carefully designed case-matching procedure, comparing results in different 
cohorts can be biased. In this study, we compared the tau PET tracers, 
18F-MK6240 and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP), both cross-sectionally and longitudinally 
by case-matching subjects in the AIBL and ADNI longitudinal cohort studies.
METHODS: A subset of 113 participants from AIBL and 113 from ADNI imaged using 
18F-MK6240 and 18F-FTP respectively, with baseline and follow-up, were matched 
based on baseline clinical diagnosis, MMSE, age and amyloid (Aβ) PET centiloid 
value. Subjects were grouped as 64 Aβ- cognitively unimpaired (CU), 22 Aβ+ CU, 
14 Aβ+ mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 13 Aβ+ Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Tracer retention was measured in the mesial, temporoparietal, rest of the 
cortex, and a meta-temporal region composed of entorhinal, inferior/middle 
temporal, fusiform, parahippocampus and amygdala. T-tests were employed to 
assess group separation at baseline using SUVR Z-scores and longitudinally using 
SUVR%/Yr.
RESULTS: Both tracers detected statistically significant differences at baseline 
in most regions between all clinical groups. Only 18F-MK6240 showed 
statistically significant higher rate of SUVR increase in Aβ+ CU compared to Aβ- 
CU in the mesial, meta-temporal and temporoparietal regions.
CONCLUSION: 18F-MK6240 appears to be a more sensitive tracer for change in tau 
level at the preclinical stage of AD.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine whether newly introduced biomarkers 
Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), 
synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), and neurogranin (NG) in 
cerebrospinal fluid are useful in evaluating the asymptomatic and early 
symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It further aims to shed new 
insight into the differences between stable subjects and those who progress to 
AD by associating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and specific magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) regions with disease progression, more deeply exploring 
how such biomarkers relate to AD pathology.
METHODS: We examined baseline and longitudinal changes over a 7-year span and 
the longitudinal interactions between CSF and MRI biomarkers for subjects from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We stratified all CSF 
(140) and MRI (525) cohort participants into five diagnostic groups (including 
converters) further dichotomized by CSF amyloid beta (Aβ) status. Linear mixed 
models were used to compare within-person rates of change across diagnostic 
groups and to evaluate the association of CSF biomarkers as predictors of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers. CSF biomarkers and disease-prone 
MRI regions are assessed for CSF proteins levels and brain structural changes.
RESULTS: VILIP-1 and SNAP-25 displayed within-person increments in early 
symptomatic, amyloid-positive groups. CSF amyloid-positive (Aβ+) subjects showed 
elevated baseline levels of total tau (tTau), phospho-tau181 (pTau), VILIP-1, 
and NG. YKL-40, SNAP-25, and NG are positively intercorrelated. Aβ+ subjects 
showed negative MRI biomarker changes. YKL-40, tTau, pTau, and VILIP-1 are 
longitudinally associated with MRI biomarkers atrophy.
DISCUSSION: Converters (CNc, MCIc) highlight the evolution of biomarkers during 
the disease progression. Results show that underlying amyloid pathology is 
associated with accelerated cognitive impairment. CSF levels of Aβ42, pTau, 
tTau, VILIP-1, and SNAP-25 show utility to discriminate between mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) converter and control subjects (CN). Higher levels of YKL-40 in 
the Aβ+ group were longitudinally associated with declines in temporal pole and 
entorhinal thickness. Increased levels of tTau, pTau, and VILIP-1 in the Aβ+ 
groups were longitudinally associated with declines in hippocampal volume. These 
CSF biomarkers should be used in assessing the characterization of the AD 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are associated with faster decline 
in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to investigate the 
association between NPS severity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, i.e., 
amyloid-β (Aβ), phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) and hippocampal volume ratio 
(HR), to characterise in more detail MCI patients with a poor prognosis.
METHODS: A total of 506 individuals with MCI and 99 cognitively unimpaired older 
adults were selected from the ADNI dataset. The patients were divided into three 
different groups based on their NPI-Q total scores: no NPS (n = 198), mild NPS 
(n = 160) and severe NPS (n = 148). Regression models were used to assess the 
association between the severity of NPS and each biomarker level and positivity 
status.
RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ levels were positively associated with older age 
and lower MMSE scores, while higher p-tau levels were associated with female sex 
and lower MMSE scores. Only patients with severe NPS had a lower HR (β = -0.18, 
p = 0.050), i.e., more pronounced medio-temporal atrophy, than those without 
NPS.
DISCUSSION: Only HR was associated with the presence of NPS, partially in line 
with previous evidence showing that severe NPS may be explained primarily by 
greater grey matter loss. Future longitudinal studies will be needed to 
ascertain the relevance of this finding.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Neurogranin has recently been proposed as a potential 
biomarker for cognitive decline and brain injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To 
test whether CSF Neurogranin levels are increased in AD and its association with 
cognitive decline, we examined 99 cognitively normal (CN) subjects, 171 patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 81 patients with AD in the 
cross-sectional study from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). The results showed that CSF Neurogranin was increased in both AD and MCI 
compared with controls. CSF Neurogranin was particularly high in patients with 
MCI and AD dementia with Aβ pathologic features. Neurogranin levels were 
significantly higher in females compared to males with MCI. Levels of 
Neurogranin between the males and females with AD and CN did not differ. 
Neurogranin levels were significantly higher in APOE ε4 carriers compared to 
APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI. Levels of Neurogranin between the APOE ε4 
carriers and APOE ε4 non-carriers with AD and CN did not differ. Elevated CSF 
Neurogranin levels were positively correlated with levels of total tau and P-tau 
in AD. The results indicated that CSF Neurogranin was increased at the prodromal 
stage of AD and might reflect synaptic injury as cognitive decline in AD.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease. 
The current positron emission tomography (PET) is expensive and limited in 
availability. In contrast, blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) show potential for 
characterizing Aβ plaques more affordably. We have previously proposed an 
MRI-based hippocampal morphometry measure to be an indicator of Aβ plaques.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an integrated model to predict brain amyloid 
PET positivity combining MRI feature and plasma Aβ42/40 ratio.
METHODS: We extracted hippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics from MR 
images and together with plasma Aβ42/40 trained a random forest classifier to 
perform a binary classification of participant brain amyloid PET positivity. We 
evaluated the model performance using two distinct cohorts, one from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the other from the Banner 
Alzheimer's Institute (BAI), including prediction accuracy, precision, recall 
rate, F1 score, and AUC score.
RESULTS: Results from ADNI (mean age 72.6, Aβ+ rate 49.5%) and BAI (mean age 
66.2, Aβ+ rate 36.9%) datasets revealed the integrated multimodal (IMM) model's 
superior performance over unimodal models. The IMM model achieved prediction 
accuracies of 0.86 in ADNI and 0.92 in BAI, surpassing unimodal models based 
solely on structural MRI (0.81 and 0.87) or plasma Aβ42/40 (0.73 and 0.81) 
predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our IMM model, combining MRI and BBBM data, offers a highly 
accurate approach to predict brain amyloid PET positivity. This innovative 
multiplex biomarker strategy presents an accessible and cost-effective avenue 
for advancing Alzheimer's disease diagnostics, leveraging diverse pathologic 
features related to Aβ plaques and structural MRI.

INTRODUCTION: It is important to study apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to 
better understand its underlying neurobiology and develop effective 
interventions. In the current study, we sought to examine the relationships 
between longitudinal apathy and regional tau burden in cognitively impaired 
older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database.
METHODS: Three hundred and nineteen ADNI participants with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD dementia underwent flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical assessment with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) annually. Longitudinal NPI Apathy (NPI-A) 
scores were examined in relation to baseline tau PET signal in three a priori 
selected regions implicated in AD and AD-related apathy (supramarginal gyrus, 
entorhinal cortex [EC] and rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC]). Secondary 
models were adjusted for global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) 
and cortical amyloid (florbetapir PET).
RESULTS: Higher baseline supramarginal gyrus and EC tau burden were each 
significantly associated with greater NPI-A over time, while rACC tau was 
associated with higher NPI-A but did not predict its trajectory over time. These 
results were retained for supramarginal and EC tau after adjusting models for 
global cognition and cortical amyloid.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that baseline in vivo tau burden in parietal 
and temporal brain regions affected in AD, and less so in a medial frontal 
region involved in motivational control, is associated with increasing apathy 
over time in older adults with MCI and AD dementia. Future work studying 
emergent apathy in relation to not only core AD pathology but also circuit level 
dysfunction may provide additional insight into the neurobiology of apathy in AD 
and opportunities for intervention.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau (Flortaucipir PET) in regions implicated in AD was associated 
with increasing apathy over timeCortical amyloid was also found to be a robust 
predictor of the trajectory of apathyEvidence of synergy between regional tau 
and amyloid in overall higher levels of apathy.

INTRODUCTION: The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) is to validate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
clinical trials. ADNI is a multisite, longitudinal, observational study that has 
collected many biomarkers since 2004. Recent publications highlight the 
multifactorial nature of late-onset AD. We discuss selected topics that provide 
insights into AD progression and outline how this knowledge may improve clinical 
trials.
METHODS: We used standard methods to identify nearly 600 publications using ADNI 
data from 2016 and 2017 (listed in Supplementary Material and searchable at 
http://adni.loni.usc.edu/news-publications/publications/).
RESULTS: (1) Data-driven AD progression models supported multifactorial 
interactions rather than a linear cascade of events. (2) β-Amyloid (Aβ) 
deposition occurred concurrently with functional connectivity changes within the 
default mode network in preclinical subjects and was followed by specific and 
progressive disconnection of functional and anatomical networks. (3) Changes in 
functional connectivity, volumetric measures, regional hypometabolism, and 
cognition were detectable at subthreshold levels of Aβ deposition. 4. Tau 
positron emission tomography imaging studies detailed a specific temporal and 
spatial pattern of tau pathology dependent on prior Aβ deposition, and related 
to subsequent cognitive decline. 5. Clustering studies using a wide range of 
modalities consistently identified a "typical AD" subgroup and a second subgroup 
characterized by executive impairment and widespread cortical atrophy in 
preclinical and prodromal subjects. 6. Vascular pathology burden may act through 
both Aβ dependent and independent mechanisms to exacerbate AD progression. 7. 
The APOE ε4 allele interacted with cerebrovascular disease to impede Aβ 
clearance mechanisms. 8. Genetic approaches identified novel genetic risk 
factors involving a wide range of processes, and demonstrated shared genetic 
risk for AD and vascular disorders, as well as the temporal and regional 
pathological associations of established AD risk alleles. 9. Knowledge of early 
pathological changes guided the development of novel prognostic biomarkers for 
preclinical subjects. 10. Placebo populations of randomized controlled clinical 
trials had highly variable trajectories of cognitive change, underscoring the 
importance of subject selection and monitoring. 11. Selection criteria based on 
Aβ positivity, hippocampal volume, baseline cognitive/functional measures, and 
APOE ε4 status in combination with improved cognitive outcome measures were 
projected to decrease clinical trial duration and cost. 12. Multiple concurrent 
therapies targeting vascular health and other AD pathology in addition to Aβ may 
be more effective than single therapies.
DISCUSSION: ADNI publications from 2016 and 2017 supported the idea of AD as a 
multifactorial disease and provided insights into the complexities of AD disease 
progression. These findings guided the development of novel biomarkers and 
suggested that subject selection on the basis of multiple factors may lower AD 
clinical trial costs and duration. The use of multiple concurrent therapies in 
these trials may prove more effective in reversing AD disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: The ATN's different modalities (fluids and neuroimaging) for each of 
the Aβ (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) elements are used for the 
biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aim to identify which ATN 
category achieves the highest potential for diagnosis and predictive accuracy of 
longitudinal cognitive decline.
METHODS: Based on the availability of plasma ATN biomarkers (plasma-derived 
Aβ42/40 , p-tau181, NFL, respectively), CSF ATN biomarkers (CSF-derived Aβ42 
/Aβ40 , p-tau181, NFL), and neuroimaging ATN biomarkers (18F-florbetapir (FBP) 
amyloid-PET, 18F-flortaucipir (FTP) tau-PET, and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET), 
a total of 2340 participants were selected from ADNI.
RESULTS: Our data analysis indicates that the area under curves (AUCs) of CSF-A, 
neuroimaging-T, and neuroimaging-N were ranked the top three ATN candidates for 
accurate diagnosis of AD. Moreover, neuroimaging ATN biomarkers display the best 
predictive ability for longitudinal cognitive decline among the three 
categories. To note, neuroimaging-T correlates well with cognitive performances 
in a negative correlation manner. Meanwhile, participants in the "N" element 
positive group, especially the CSF-N positive group, experience the fastest 
cognitive decline compared with other groups defined by ATN biomarkers. In 
addition, the voxel-wise analysis showed that CSF-A related to tau accumulation 
and FDG-PET indexes more strongly in subjects with MCI stage. According to our 
analysis of the data, the best three ATN candidates for a precise diagnosis of 
AD are CSF-A, neuroimaging-T, and neuroimaging-N.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings suggest that plasma, CSF, and 
neuroimaging biomarkers differ considerably within the ATN framework; the most 
accurate target biomarkers for diagnosing AD were the CSF-A, neuroimaging-T, and 
neuroimaging-N within each ATN modality. Moreover, neuroimaging-T and CSF-N both 
show excellent ability in the prediction of cognitive decline in two different 
dimensions.

IMPORTANCE: Allelic variation in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
Val66Met polymorphism moderates increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
tau and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), measured using immunoassay, and 
cognitive decline in presymptomatic dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease 
(DIAD). Advances in mass spectrometry show that CSF tau phosphorylation 
occupancy at threonine 181 and 217 (p-tau181/tau181, p-tau217/tau217) increases 
with initial β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, while phosphorylation occupancy at 
threonine 205 (p-tau205/tau205) and level of total tau increase when brain 
atrophy and clinical symptoms become evident.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether site-specific tau phosphorylation occupancy 
(ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated tau) is associated with BDNF 
Val66Met in presymptomatic and symptomatic DIAD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional cohort study included 
participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and 
Aβ-positive cognitively normal older adults in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Data were collected from 2009 through 2018 at 
multicenter clinical sites in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, 
with no follow-up. DIAN participants provided a CSF sample and completed 
clinical and cognitive assessments. Data analysis was conducted between March 
2020 and March 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mass spectrometry analysis was used to determine 
site-specific tau phosphorylation level; tau levels were also measured using 
immunoassay. Episodic memory and global cognitive composites were computed.
RESULTS: Of 374 study participants, 144 were mutation noncarriers, 156 were 
presymptomatic mutation carriers, and 74 were symptomatic carriers. Of the 527 
participants in the network, 153 were excluded because their CSF sample, BDNF 
status, or both were unavailable. Also included were 125 Aβ-positive cognitively 
normal older adults in the ADNI. The mean (SD) age of DIAD participants was 38.7 
(10.9) years; 43% were women. The mean (SD) age of participants with preclinical 
sporadic AD was 74.8 (5.6) years; 52% were women. In presymptomatic mutation 
carriers, compared with Val66 homozygotes, Met66 carriers showed significantly 
poorer episodic memory (d = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.28-0.95), lower hippocampal volume 
(d = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.71), and higher p-tau217/tau217 (d = 0.64; 95% CI, 
0.30-0.97), p-tau181/tau181 (d = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.32-0.99), and mass spectrometry 
total tau (d = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.10-0.76). In symptomatic mutation carriers, Met66 
carriers showed significantly poorer global cognition (d = 1.17; 95% CI, 
0.65-1.66) and higher p-tau217/tau217 (d = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.05-1.01), mass 
spectrometry total tau (d = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.28-1.25), and p-tau205/tau205 
(d = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.46-1.45), when compared with Val66 homozygotes. In 
preclinical sporadic AD, Met66 carriers showed poorer episodic memory (d = 0.39; 
95% CI, 0.00-0.77) and higher total tau (d = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.07-0.84) and 
p-tau181 (d = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.07-0.85).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In DIAD, clinical disease stage and BDNF Met66 were 
associated with cognitive impairment and levels of site-specific tau 
phosphorylation. This suggests that pharmacological strategies designed to 
increase neurotrophic support in the presymptomatic stages of AD may be 
beneficial.

Tau proteins accumulation and their spreading pattern were affected by gender in 
cognitive impairment patients, especially in the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, it was unclear whether the gender effects for tau 
deposition influenced by amyloid deposition. The aim of this study was to 
investigate gender differences for tau depositions in Aβ positive (A+) subjects. 
In this study, tau and amyloid positron emission tomography images, structural 
magnetic resonance imaging images, and demographic information were collected 
from 179 subjects in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
and 63 subjects from Huashan Hospital. Subjects were classified as T+ or T- 
according to the presence or absence of tau (T) biomarkers. We used two-sample t 
test and one-way analysis of variance test to analyze the effect of gender with 
adjusting for age, years of education, and Minimum Mental State Examination. In 
the ADNI cohort, we found differences in Tau deposition in fusiform gyrus, 
inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus between 
the female T+ (FT+) and male T+ (MT+) groups (p < 0.05). Tau deposition did not 
differ significantly between female T- (FT-) and male T- (MT-) subjects 
(p > 0.05). In the Huashan Hospital cohort, there was no difference in Tau 
deposition between FT+ and MT+ (p > 0.05). The results show that tau depositions 
significantly increased in females in above brain regions. Our findings suggest 
that tau deposition is influenced by gender in the A+ subjects. This result has 
important clinical implications for the development of gender-guided early 
interventions for patients with both Tau and Amyloid depositions.

BACKGROUND: The 2018 NIA-AA Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Research Framework states 
that subtle cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals can be 
measured by subjective reports or evidence of objective decline on 
neuropsychological measures. Both subjective memory complaint (SMC) and 
objective subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD) have been shown to be associated 
with future cognitive decline and AD biomarkers. We examined whether there are 
differences in tau PET levels between (a) SMC- vs. SMC+ participants, (b) 
Obj-SCD- vs. Obj-SCD+ participants, and (c) participants with overlapping vs. 
discrepant SMC and Obj-SCD classifications.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 236) were classified at baseline as positive 
or negative for SMC (SMC- n = 77; SMC+ n = 159) based on the first 12 items of 
the Cognitive Change Index and/or classified as positive or negative for Obj-SCD 
(Obj-SCD- n = 173; Obj-SCD+ n = 63) based on previously defined 
neuropsychological criteria. Analyses of covariance, adjusting for age, sex, 
APOE ε4 carrier status, and pulse pressure, examined the group differences in 
tau PET (AV-1451) using a composite standardized uptake variable ratio (SUVR) 
for regions consistent with Braak stage III/IV. The chi-squared tests examined 
the tau positivity rates across the groups.
RESULTS: Obj-SCD+ participants had higher tau continuous SUVR levels (p = .035, 
ηp2 = .019) and higher rates of tau positivity (15.8% Obj-SCD- vs. 30.2% 
Obj-SCD+) than Obj-SCD- participants. Neither tau levels (p = .381, ηp2 = .003) 
nor rates of tau positivity (18.2% SMC- and 20.1% SMC+) differed between the SMC 
groups. There was very little agreement between SMC and Obj-SCD classifications 
(42%; κ = 0.008, p = .862). Participants who were Obj-SCD+ without SMC had the 
highest tau PET levels and differed from participants who were SMC+ without 
Obj-SCD (p = .022). Tau levels in participants with both SMC and Obj-SCD did not 
differ from those with only Obj-SCD (p = .216). Tau positivity rates across the 
SMC-/Obj-SCD-, SMC+/Obj-SCD-, SMC-/Obj-SCD+, and SMC+/Obj-SCD+ groups were 
10.5%, 18.1%, 40.0%, and 25.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Participants with Obj-SCD had a greater tau PET burden than those 
without Obj-SCD, but SMC was not associated with higher tau levels. The 
combination of SMC and Obj-SCD did not have higher tau levels than Obj-SCD 
alone. Findings add to the evidence that the Obj-SCD classification is 
associated with AD biomarkers and faster cognitive decline in ADNI participants, 
but further work is needed to validate this approach in more 
representative/diverse cohorts.

Background: This study examines the relationship between delusional severity in 
cognitively impaired adults with automatically computed volume and texture 
biomarkers from the Normal Appearing Brain Matter (NABM) in FLAIR MRI. Methods: 
Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 24) and Alzheimer’s Disease 
(AD, n = 18) with delusions of varying severities based on Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) (1—mild, 2—moderate, 3—severe) from the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed for this task. 
The NABM region, which is gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) combined, was 
automatically segmented in FLAIR MRI volumes with intensity standardization and 
thresholding. Three imaging biomarkers were computed from this region, including 
NABM volume and two texture markers called “Integrity” and “Damage”. Together, 
these imaging biomarkers quantify structural changes in brain volume, 
microstructural integrity and tissue damage. Multivariable regression was used 
to investigate relationships between imaging biomarkers and delusional 
severities (1, 2 and 3). Sex, age, education, APOE4 and baseline cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) tau were included as co-variates. Results: Biomarkers were extracted 
from a total of 42 participants with longitudinal time points representing 164 
imaging volumes. Significant associations were found for all three NABM 
biomarkers between delusion level 3 and level 1. Integrity was also sensitive 
enough to show differences between delusion level 1 and delusion level 2. A 
significant specified interaction was noted with severe delusions (level 3) and 
CSF tau for all imaging biomarkers (p < 0.01). APOE4 homozygotes were also 
significantly related to the biomarkers. Conclusion: Cognitively impaired older 
adults with more severe delusions have greater global brain disease burden in 
the WM and GM combined (NABM) as measured using FLAIR MRI. Relative to patients 
with mild delusions, tissue degeneration in the NABM was more pronounced in 
subjects with higher delusional symptoms, with a significant association with 
CSF tau. Future studies are required to establish potential tau-associated 
mechanisms of increased delusional severity.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies revealed that abnormal deposition of 
tau spreads in a specific spatial pattern, namely Braak stage. However, Braak 
staging is based on post mortem brains, each of which represents the cross 
section of the tau trajectory in disease progression, and numerous studies were 
reported that do not conform to that model. This study thus aimed to identify 
the tau trajectory and quantify the tau progression in a data-driven approach 
with the continuous latent space learned by variational autoencoder (VAE).
METHODS: A total of 1080 [18F]Flortaucipir brain positron emission tomography 
(PET) images were collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. VAE was built to compress the hidden features from tau images 
in latent space. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering and minimum spanning tree 
(MST) were applied to organize the features and calibrate them to the tau 
progression, thus deriving pseudo-time. The image-level tau trajectory was 
inferred by continuously sampling across the calibrated latent features. We 
assessed the pseudo-time with regard to tau standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVr) in AD-vulnerable regions, amyloid deposit, glucose metabolism, cognitive 
scores, and clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: We identified four clusters that plausibly capture certain stages of AD 
and organized the clusters in the latent space. The inferred tau trajectory 
agreed with the Braak staging. According to the derived pseudo-time, tau first 
deposits in the parahippocampal and amygdala, and then spreads to the fusiform, 
inferior temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate. Prior to the regional tau 
deposition, amyloid accumulates first.
CONCLUSION: The spatiotemporal trajectory of tau progression inferred in this 
study was consistent with Braak staging. The profile of other biomarkers in 
disease progression agreed well with previous findings. We addressed that this 
approach additionally has the potential to quantify tau progression as a 
continuous variable by taking a whole-brain tau image into account.

BACKGROUND: Previous work examining normal controls from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) identified substantial biological heterogeneity. 
We hypothesized that ADNI mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects would also 
exhibit heterogeneity with possible clinical implications.
METHODS: ADNI subjects diagnosed with amnestic MCI (n=138) were clustered based 
on baseline magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum 
biomarkers. The clusters were compared with respect to longitudinal atrophy, 
cognitive trajectory, and time to conversion.
RESULTS: Four clusters emerged with distinct biomarker patterns: The first 
cluster was biologically similar to normal controls and rarely converted to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) during follow-up. The second cluster had 
characteristics of early Alzheimer's pathology. The third cluster showed the 
most severe atrophy but barely abnormal tau levels and a substantial proportion 
converted to clinical AD. The fourth cluster appeared to be pre-AD and nearly 
all converted to AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with MCI who were clinically similar showed substantial 
heterogeneity in biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying drug use necessitates better Alzheimer disease 
(AD) detection. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) leverages cognitive decline to 
identify the risk group; similarly, mild behavioral impairment (MBI) leverages 
behavioral change. Adding MBI to MCI improves dementia prognostication over 
conventional approaches of incorporating neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Here, 
to determine if adding MBI would better identify AD, we interrogated 
associations between MBI in MCI, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers [β-amyloid 
(Aβ), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and total-tau (tau)-ATN], cross-sectionally 
and longitudinally.
METHODS: Data were from two independent referral-based cohorts, ADNI (mean[SD] 
follow-up 3.14[1.07] years) and MEMENTO (4.25[1.40] years), collected 2003-2021. 
Exposure was based on three-group stratification: 1) NPS meeting MBI criteria; 
2) conventionally measured NPS (NPSnotMBI); and 3) noNPS. Cohorts were analyzed 
separately for: 1) cross-sectional associations between NPS status and ATN 
biomarkers (linear regressions); 2) 4-year longitudinal repeated-measures 
associations of MBI and NPSnotMBI with ATN biomarkers (hierarchical linear 
mixed-effects models-LMEs); and 3) rates of incident dementia (Cox proportional 
hazards regressions).
RESULTS: Of 510 MCI participants, 352 were from ADNI (43.5% females; mean [SD] 
age, 71.68 [7.40] years), and 158 from MEMENTO (46.2% females; 68.98 [8.18] 
years). In ADNI, MBI was associated with lower Aβ42 (standardized β [95%CI], 
-5.52% [-10.48-(-0.29)%]; p = 0.039), and Aβ42/40 (p = 0.01); higher p-tau 
(9.67% [3.96-15.70%]; p = 0.001), t-tau (7.71% [2.70-12.97%]; p = 0.002), 
p-tau/Aβ42 (p < 0.001), and t-tau/Aβ42 (p = 0.001). NPSnotMBI was associated 
only with lower Aβ42/40 (p = 0.045). LMEs revealed a similar 4-year AD-specific 
biomarker profile for MBI, with NPSnotMBI associated only with higher t-tau. MBI 
had a greater rate of incident dementia (HR [95%CI], 3.50 [1.99-6.17; 
p < 0.001). NPSnotMBI did not differ from noNPS (HR 0.96 [0.49-1.89]; 
p = 0.916). In MEMENTO, MBI demonstrated a similar magnitude and direction of 
effect for all biomarkers, but with a greater reduction in Aβ40. HR for incident 
dementia was 3.93 (p = 0.004) in MBI, and 1.83 (p = 0.266) in NPSnotMBI. Of MBI 
progressors to dementia, 81% developed AD dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a biological basis for NPS that meet MBI 
criteria, the continued inclusion of MBI in NIA-AA ATN clinical staging, and the 
utility of MBI criteria to improve identification of patients for enrollment in 
disease-modifying drug trials or for clinical care.

PURPOSE: To examine associations between the APOE-ε2 and APOE-ε4 alleles and 
core Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological hallmarks as measured by amyloid-β 
(Aβ) and tau PET in older individuals without dementia.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 462 ADNI participants without dementia who 
underwent Aβ ([18F]florbetapir or [18F]florbetaben) and tau ([18F]flortaucipir) 
PET, structural MRI, and cognitive testing. Employing APOE-ε3 homozygotes as the 
reference group, associations between APOE-ε2 and APOE-ε4 carriership with 
global Aβ PET and regional tau PET measures (entorhinal cortex (ERC), inferior 
temporal cortex, and Braak-V/VI neocortical composite regions) were investigated 
using linear regression models. In a subset of 156 participants, we also 
investigated associations between APOE genotype and regional tau accumulation 
over time using linear mixed models. Finally, we assessed whether Aβ mediated 
the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between APOE genotype and tau.
RESULTS: Compared to APOE-ε3 homozygotes, APOE-ε2 carriers had lower global Aβ 
burden (βstd [95% confidence interval (CI)]: - 0.31 [- 0.45, - 0.16], p = 0.034) 
but did not differ on regional tau burden or tau accumulation over time. APOE-ε4 
participants showed higher Aβ (βstd [95%CI]: 0.64 [0.42, 0.82], p < 0.001) and 
tau burden (βstd range: 0.27-0.51, all p < 0.006). In mediation analyses, 
APOE-ε4 only retained an Aβ-independent effect on tau in the ERC. APOE-ε4 showed 
a trend towards increased tau accumulation over time in Braak-V/VI compared to 
APOE-ε3 homozygotes (βstd [95%CI]: 0.10 [- 0.02, 0.18], p = 0.11), and this 
association was fully mediated by baseline Aβ.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the established protective effect of the 
APOE-ε2 allele against developing clinical AD is primarily linked to resistance 
against Aβ deposition rather than tau pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is indicated by a decrease in amyloid 
beta 42 (Aβ42) level or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and by increased levels of Tau with 
phosphorylated threonine at position 181 (pTau181) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
years before the onset of clinical symptoms. However, once only pTau181 is 
increased, cognitive decline in individuals with subjective or mild cognitive 
impairment is slowed compared to individuals with AD. Instead of a decrease in 
Aβ42 levels, an increase in Aβ42 was observed in these individuals, leading to 
the proposal to refer to them as nondemented subjects with increased pTau-levels 
and Aβ surge with subtle cognitive deterioration (PASSED). In this study, we 
determined the longitudinal atrophy rates of AD, PASSED, and Biomarker-negative 
nondemented individuals of two independent cohorts to determine whether these 
groups can be distinguished by their longitudinal atrophy patterns or rates.
METHODS: Depending on their CSF-levels of pTau 181 (T), total Tau (tTau, N), 
Aβ42 or ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 (A), 185 non-demented subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 62 non-demented subjects from 
Erlangen AD cohort were assigned to an ATN group (A-T-N-, A-T+N±, A+T-N±and 
A+T+N±) and underwent T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). 
Longitudinal grey matter (GM) atrophy patterns were assessed with voxel-based 
morphometry (VBM) using the cat12 toolbox on spm12 (statistical parametric 
mapping) of MRI scans from individuals in the ADNI cohort with a mean follow-up 
of 2 and 5 years, respectively. The annualized atrophy rate for individuals in 
the Erlangen cohort was determined using region of interest analysis (ROI) in 
terms of a confirmatory analysis.
RESULTS: In the A-T+N± group, VBM did not identify any brain region that showed 
greater longitudinal atrophy than the A+T+N±, A+T+N± or biomarker negative 
control group. In contrast, marked longitudinal atrophy in the temporal lobe was 
evident in the A+T-N± group compared with A+T-N±  and biomarker-negative 
subjects. The ROI in the angular gyrus identified by VBM analysis of the ADNI 
cohort did not discriminate better than the hippocampal volume and atrophy rate 
between AD and PASSED in the confirmatory analysis.
DISCUSSION: In this study, nondemented subjects with PASSED did not show a 
unique longitudinal atrophy pattern in comparison to nondemented subjects with 
AD. The nonsignificant atrophy rate compared with controls suggests that 
increased pTau181-levels without concomitant amyloidopathy did not indicate a 
neurodegenerative disorder.

BACKGROUND: APOE is the largest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but there is a substantial polygenic component. Polygenic risk scores 
(PRS) can summarize small effects across the genome but may obscure differential 
risk across molecular processes and pathways that contribute to heterogeneity of 
disease presentation.
OBJECTIVE: We examined polygenic risk impacting specific AD-associated pathways 
and its relationship with clinical status and biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and 
neurodegeneration (A/T/N).
METHODS: We analyzed data from 1,411 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We applied pathway analysis and clustering to 
identify AD-associated "pathway clusters" and construct pathway-specific PRSs 
(excluding the APOE region). We tested associations with diagnostic status, 
abnormal levels of amyloid and ptau, and hippocampal volume.
RESULTS: Thirteen pathway clusters were identified, and eight pathway-specific 
PRSs were significantly associated with AD diagnosis. Amyloid-positivity was 
associated with endocytosis and fibril formation, response misfolded protein, 
and regulation protein tyrosine PRSs. Ptau positivity and hippocampal volume 
were both related to protein localization and mitophagy PRS, and ptau-positivity 
was also associated with an immune signaling PRS. A global AD PRS showed 
stronger associations with diagnosis and all biomarkers compared to pathway 
PRSs.
CONCLUSIONS: Pathway PRS may contribute to understanding separable disease 
processes, but do not add significant power for predictive purposes. These 
findings demonstrate that AD-phenotypes may be preferentially associated with 
risk in specific pathways, and defining genetic risk along multiple dimensions 
may clarify etiological heterogeneity in AD. This approach to delineate 
pathway-specific PRS can be used to study other complex diseases.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variations in the inflammatory Caspase-1 gene have been 
shown associated with cognitive function in elderly individuals and in 
predisposition to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its detailed mechanism before 
the typical AD onset was still unclear. Our current study evaluated the impact 
of Caspase-1 common variant rs554344 on the pathological processes of brain 
amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Data used in our study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We examined the relationship between 
Caspase-1 rs554344 allele carrier status with AD-related cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), PET, and MRI measures at baseline by using a multiple linear regression 
model. We also analyzed the longitudinal effects of this variant on the change 
rates of CSF biomarkers and imaging data using a mixed effect model.
RESULTS: We found that Caspase-1 variant was significantly associated with FDG 
PET levels and CSF t-tau levels at baseline in total non-demented elderly group, 
and especially in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroup. In addition, this 
variant was also detected associated with CSF p-tau levels in MCI subgroup. The 
mediation analysis showed that CSF p-tau partially mediated the association 
between Caspase-1 variant and CSF t-tau levels, accounting for 80% of the total 
effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated a potential role of Caspase-1 variant in 
influencing cognitive function might through changing tau 
related-neurodegeneration process.

Though previous studies revealed the potential associations of elevated levels 
of plasma fibrinogen with dementia, there is still limited understanding 
regarding the influence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers on these 
associations. We sought to investigate the interrelationships among fibrinogen, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and cognition in non-demented adults. 
We included 1996 non-demented adults from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and 
LifestylE (CABLE) study and 337 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. The associations of fibrinogen with AD biomarkers 
and cognition were explored using multiple linear regression models. The 
mediation analyses with 10 000 bootstrapped iterations were conducted to explore 
the mediating effects of AD biomarkers on cognition. In addition, interaction 
analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the influence of 
covariates on the relationships between fibrinogen and AD biomarkers. 
Participants exhibiting low Aβ42 were designated as A+, while those 
demonstrating high phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and total tau (Tau) were labeled 
as T+ and N+, respectively. Individuals with normal measures of Aβ42 and P-tau 
were categorized as the A-T- group, and those with abnormal levels of both Aβ42 
and P-tau were grouped under A+T+. Fibrinogen was higher in the A+ subgroup 
compared to that in the A- subgroup (p = 0.026). Fibrinogen was higher in the 
A+T+ subgroup compared to that in the A-T- subgroup (p = 0.011). Higher 
fibrinogen was associated with worse cognition and Aβ pathology (all p < 0.05). 
Additionally, the associations between fibrinogen and cognition were partially 
mediated by Aβ pathology (mediation proportion range 8%-28%). Interaction 
analyses and subgroup analyses showed that age and ApoE ε4 affect the 
relationships between fibrinogen and Aβ pathology. Fibrinogen was associated 
with both cognition and Aβ pathology. Aβ pathology may be a critical mediator 
for impacts of fibrinogen on cognition.

BACKGROUND: Several blood-based biomarkers are promising to be used in the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) including Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and 
neurofilament light (NfL). The kidney is associated with the clearance of 
proteins. It is crucial to evaluate the effect of renal function on the 
diagnostic performance of these biomarkers before clinical implementation, which 
is important for the establishment of reference ranges and the interpretation of 
results.
METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis based on ADNI cohort. Renal 
function was determined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
Plasma Aβ42/40 was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS). Plasma p-tau181 and NfL were analyzed by Single Molecule array 
(Simoa) technique. [18F] florbetapir-PET (Aβ-PET) was used as a reference 
standard to estimate the brain amyloid load. The cutoff of Aβ-PET positivity was 
defined as ≥1.11. Linear regression models were used to investigate the 
associations of continuous eGFR with each plasma biomarker separately. The 
diagnostic accuracies of plasma biomarkers for positive brain amyloid across 
different renal function groups were analyzed by Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve. Youden-Index was used to determine the cutoff 
levels.
RESULTS: A total of 645 participants were included in this study. The levels and 
diagnostic performance of Aβ42/40 were not affected by renal function. eGFR was 
only found negatively associated with p-tau181 levels in Aβ-PET negetive sample 
(β = -0.09, p = 0.039). eGFR was found negatively associated with NfL levels 
both in whole sample and Aβ-PET stratified groups (β = -0.27, p < 0.001 in whole 
sample; β = -0.28, p = 0.004 in A-; β = -0.27, p < 0.001 in A+). The diagnostic 
accuracies of p-tau181 and NfL were not affected by renal function. But the 
cutoff values of p-tau181 and NfL changed in participants with mild to moderate 
eGFR decline compared to participants with normal eGFR.
CONCLUSION: Plasma Aβ42/40 was a robust biomarker for AD which was not affected 
by renal function. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL levels were affected by renal 
function, specific reference values of them should be considered in populations 
with different renal function stages.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in 
cognitively normal (CN) seniors on regional metabolism of specific brain regions 
known to be affected by p-tau deposition.
METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), volumetric 
magnetic resonance imaging scans, and global amyloid standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVr) were obtained for 210 CNs from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI2). Region of interest (ROI) extraction was used 
to obtain functional SUVr from six bilateral ROIs: amygdala (AM), entorhinal 
cortex (EC), hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal, posterior cingulate (PC), and 
middle temporal gyrus. Every metabolic SUVr set was averaged and analyzed 
against the corresponding subject's amyloid SUVr. Correlation analyses were 
conducted on the full group and between APOE ε4-positive and APOE ε4-negative 
subgroups.
RESULTS: The APOE ε4+ group exhibited significantly higher metabolism in the EC 
(r = 0.270, P = .038) and AM (r = 0.267, P = .041). When a significance of the 
difference test was conducted between the APOE ε4+ and APOE ε4-groups, these 
same regions remained significant: P = .012 and P = .016, respectively. By 
contrast, the APOE ε4 group displayed only the conventionally expected result of 
reduced regional metabolism in the PC (r = -0.161, P = .048), with higher Aβ 
load.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of amyloid positivity on brain metabolism is regionally 
specific, and APOE ε4 status substantially modulates regional glucose uptake in 
these regions. The APOE ε4 allele may cause earlier emergence of clinical 
symptoms in AD via a mechanism that influences regional metabolic demand in 
specifically those regions where p-tau deposition is known to occur earliest.

BACKGROUND: Clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin in relation to AD biomarkers using a 
longitudinal cohort of non-demented individuals.
METHODS: We gathered a sample comprising 86 individuals under cognition normal 
(CN) and 134 patients diagnosed with MCI via the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. To investigate the correlation of CSF 
clusterin with cognitive function and markers of key physiological changes, we 
employed multiple linear regression and mixed-effect models. We undertook a 
causal mediation analysis to inspect the mediating influence of CSF clusterin on 
cognitive abilities.
RESULTS: Pathological characteristics associated with baseline Aβ42, Tau, brain 
volume, exhibited a correlation with initial CSF clusterin in the general 
population, Specifically, these correlations were especially prominent in the 
MCI population; CSF Aβ42 (PCN = 0.001; PMCI = 0.007), T-tau (PCN < 0.001; 
PMCI < 0.001), and Mid temporal (PCN = 0.033; PMCI = 0.005). Baseline CSF 
clusterin level was predictive of measurable cognitive shifts in the MCI 
population, as indicated by MMSE (β = 0.202, p = 0.029), MEM (β = 0.186, p = 
0.036), RAVLT immediate recall (β = 0.182, p = 0.038), and EF scores (β = 0.221, 
p = 0.013). In MCI population, the alterations in brain regions (17.87% of the 
total effect) mediated the effect of clusterin on cognition. It was found that 
variables such as age, gender, and presence of APOE ε4 carrier status, 
influenced some of these connections.
CONCLUSION: Our investigation underscored a correlation between CSF clusterin 
concentrations and pivotal AD indicators, while also highlighting clusterin's 
potential role as a protective factor for cognitive abilities in MCI patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide, and the 
genetic mechanism of which is not yet fully understood. Much evidence has 
accumulated over the past decade to suggest that after the first large-scale 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted, the problem of "missing 
heritability" in AD is still a great challenge. Epistasis has been considered as 
one of the main causes of "missing heritability" in AD, which has been largely 
ignored in human genetics. The focus of current genome-wide epistasis studies is 
usually on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have significant 
individual effects, and the amount of heritability explained by which was very 
low. Moreover, AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal 
damage, and some studies have suggested that hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) 
mediates neuronal death by inducing necroptosis and inflammation in AD. 
Therefore, this study focused on identifying epistasis between two-marker 
interactions at marginal main effects across the whole genome using 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) P-tau as quantitative trait (QT). We sought to detect 
interactions between SNPs in a multi-GPU based linear regression method by using 
age, gender, and clinical diagnostic status (cds) as covariates. We then used 
the STRING online tool to perform the PPI network and identify two-marker 
epistasis at the level of gene-gene interaction. A total of 758 SNP pairs were 
found to be statistically significant. Particularly, between the marginal main 
effect SNP pairs, highly significant SNP-SNP interactions were identified, which 
explained a relatively high variance at the P-tau level. In addition, 331 
AD-related genes were identified, 10 gene-gene interaction pairs were replicated 
in the PPI network. The identified gene-gene interactions and genes showed 
associations with AD in terms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, 
neuronal cells activation and brain development, thereby leading to cognitive 
decline in AD, which is indirectly associated with the P-tau pathological 
feature of AD and in turn supports the results of this study. Thus, the results 
of our study might be beneficial for explaining part of the "missing 
heritability" of AD.

Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a distinct disease subtype with 
a more rapid progression of illness evidenced by an increased velocity of 
cognitive decline and a hastened mortality. Previous biomarker and post-mortem 
studies have implicated tau neuropathology as a possible mediator of the 
accelerated decline in AD psychosis. Tau positron emission tomography (PET) 
neuroimaging provides the opportunity to evaluate tau pathology in-vivo, so that 
clinical symptomatology can be correlated with disease pathology. [18F]-AV1451 
(Flortaucipir) is a PET ligand with high affinity for insoluble paired-helical 
filaments (PHFs) of hyperphosphorylated tau. In order to determine whether the 
development of psychosis and worsened prognosis in AD is associated with an 
increased burden of tau pathology that can be identified with tau imaging, we 
identified subjects within the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI) who had [18F]-AV1451 imaging at baseline and became psychotic over the 
course of the study (N = 17) and matched them 1:3 for gender, age, and education 
to subjects who had [18F]-AV1451 imaging at baseline and did not become 
psychotic (N = 50). We compared baseline [18F]-AV1451 retention, in addition to 
cognitive and functional baseline and longitudinal change, in those who became 
psychotic over the course of participation in ADNI with those who did not. 
Results suggest that increases in tau pathology in frontal, medial temporal, and 
occipital cortices, visualized with [18F]-AV1451 binding, are associated with 
psychosis and a more rapid cognitive and functional decline.

The objective of this study was to assess the association of sex and the 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele with brain tau deposition and atrophy in older 
adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using quantitative 18F-AV-1451 positron 
emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: 
Preprocessed 18F-AV-1451 tau PET, raw T1-weighted structural MR images, 
demographic information, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) and 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements from 57 elderly individuals with AD were 
downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
An iteratively reblurred Van Cittert partial volume correction (PVC) method was 
applied to all preprocessed PET images. MRI images were used for PET spatial 
normalization and gray matter volume calculation. 18F-AV-1451 PET standardized 
uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated relative to the cerebellum gray matter. 
The effect of sex and APOE ε4 status on SUVR and gray matter volume were 
assessed at both region of interest (ROI) and voxelwise levels. Results: Female 
APOE ε4 carriers (FACs) had significant higher 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs in the lateral 
temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, medial temporal, inferior temporal, 
entorhinal cortex, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus regions, and exhibited 
smaller gray matter volumes in the posterior cingulate, medial temporal, 
inferior temporal and amygdala regions, as compared to the non-FACs (NFACs) 
comprised of female APOE ε4 non-carriers, male APOE ε4 carriers and male APOE ε4 
non-carriers. Voxelwise analysis revealed forebrain and limbic clusters with 
greater 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs and lower gray matter volume between FACs compared to 
the NFACs. Negative correlations between ROI 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs and gray matter 
volumes were significant after adjusting for age and years of education. 
Conclusions: Among elderly individuals with AD, sex modified the effects of the 
APOE ε4 allele on region-specific tau deposition and gray matter volume. FACs 
had elevated brain region-specific tau PET SUVR and decreased gray matter volume 
in comparison to NFACs. The study provides a basis for the use of precision 
medicine in the diagnosis of AD and evaluation of therapeutics using 18F-AV-1451 
PET and structural MRI.

IMPORTANCE: Characterization of early tau deposition in individuals with 
preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) is critical for prevention trials that aim to 
select individuals at risk for AD and halt the progression of disease.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of cortical tau positron emission 
tomography (PET) heterogeneity in a large cohort of clinically unimpaired older 
adults with elevated β-amyloid (A+).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study examined 
prerandomized tau PET, amyloid PET, structural magnetic resonance imaging, 
demographic, and cognitive data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
AD (A4) Study from April 2014 to December 2017. Follow-up analyses used 
observational tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS), and the Wisconsin Registry for 
Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 
(together hereinafter referred to as Wisconsin) to evaluate consistency. 
Participants were clinically unimpaired at the study visit closest to the tau 
PET scan and had available amyloid and tau PET data (A4 Study, n = 447; ADNI, 
n = 433; HABS, n = 190; and Wisconsin, n = 328). No participants who met 
eligibility criteria were excluded. Data were analyzed from May 11, 2021, to 
January 25, 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Individuals with preclinical AD with heterogeneous 
cortical tau PET patterns (A+T cortical+) were identified by examining 
asymmetrical cortical tau signal and disproportionate cortical tau signal 
relative to medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau. Voxelwise tau patterns, amyloid, 
neurodegeneration, cognition, and demographic characteristics were examined.
RESULTS: The 447 A4 participants (A+ group, 392; and normal β-amyloid group, 
55), with a mean (SD) age of 71.8 (4.8) years, included 239 women (54%). A total 
of 36 individuals in the A+ group (9% of the A+ group) exhibited heterogeneous 
cortical tau patterns and were further categorized into 3 subtypes: asymmetrical 
left, precuneus dominant, and asymmetrical right. A total of 116 individuals in 
the A+ group (30% of the A+ group) showed elevated MTL tau (A+T MTL+). 
Individuals in the A+T cortical+ group were younger than those in the A+T MTL+ 
group (t61.867 = -2.597; P = .03). Across the A+T cortical+ and A+T MTL+ groups, 
increased regional tau was associated with reduced hippocampal volume and MTL 
thickness but not with cortical thickness. Memory scores were comparable between 
the A+T cortical+ and A+T MTL+ groups, whereas executive functioning scores were 
lower for the A+T cortical+ group than for the A+T MTL+ group. The prevalence of 
the A+T cortical+ group and tau patterns within the A+T cortical+ group were 
consistent in ADNI, HABS, and Wisconsin.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that early tau deposition may 
follow multiple trajectories during preclinical AD and may involve several 
cortical regions. Staging procedures, especially those based on neuropathology, 
that assume a uniform trajectory across individuals are insufficient for disease 
monitoring with tau imaging.

OBJECTIVES: Mild cognitive impairment presenting with an amnestic syndrome 
(aMCI) and amyloid positivity is considered due to AD. Many subjects, however, 
can show an overall very slow progression relevant for differential diagnosis, 
prognosis, and treatment. This study assessed PET biomarkers, including brain 
glucose metabolism, tau, and amyloid load, in a series of comparable aMCI at 
baseline, clinically evaluated at follow-up.
METHODS: We included 72 aMCI subjects from Geneva Memory Center (N = 31) and 
ADNI cohorts (N = 41), selected based on available FDG-PET, tau-PET, 
amyloid-PET, and clinical follow-up (2.3 years ± 1.2). A data-driven algorithm 
classified brain metabolic patterns into subtypes that were then compared for 
clinical and PET biomarker measures and cognitive decline. Voxel-wise 
comparisons were performed both with FDG-PET and tau-PET data.
RESULTS: The algorithm classified three metabolic subtypes, namely 
"Hippocampal-sparing with cortical hypometabolism" (Type1; N = 27), "Hippocampal 
and cortical hypometabolism" (Type 2; N = 23), and "Medial temporal 
hypometabolism" (Type 3; N = 22). Amyloid positivity and tau accumulation in the 
medial temporal and neocortical regions characterized Type 1 and Type 2, whereas 
Type 3 showed no significant tau pathology, variable amyloid positivity, and 
stability at follow-up. All tau-positive patients, independently of the 
FDG-based subtype, showed faster cognitive decline.
INTERPRETATION: aMCI subjects can differ in metabolic patterns, tau and amyloid 
pathology, and clinical progression. Here, we complemented with PET tau 
biomarker the specific brain hypometabolic patterns at the individual level in 
the prodromal phase, contributing to the patient's classification. Tau PET is 
the most accurate biomarker in supporting or excluding the AD diagnosis in aMCI 
across metabolic subtypes and also predicting the risk of decline.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the co-existence of global 
small vessel disease (SVD) burdens and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies 
change hippocampal volume (HV) and cognitive function of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) subjects. We obtained MRI images, cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers (Aβ1-42 and p-tau), and neuropsychological tests of 310 MCI subjects 
from ADNI. The global SVD score was assessed. We used linear regression and 
linear mixing effect to analyze the effects of global SVD burdens, AD 
pathologies, and their interactions (SVD*AD) on baseline and longitudinal HV and 
cognition respectively. We used simple mediation effect to analyze the 
influencing pathways. After adjusting for global SVD and SVD*AD, Aβ remained 
independently correlated with baseline and longitudinal HV (std β = 0.294, 
p = .007; std β = 0.292, p < .001), indicating that global SVD did not affect 
the correlation between Aβ and HV. Global SVD score was correlated with 
longitudinal but not baseline HV (std β = 0.470, p = .050), suggesting that 
global SVD may be more representative of long-term permanent impairment. Global 
SVD, AD pathologies, and SVD*AD were independently correlated with baseline and 
longitudinal cognitions, in which the association of Aβ (B = 0.005, 95% CI: 
0.005; 0.024) and p-tau (B = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.004; -0.000) with cognition were 
mediated by HV, suggesting that HV is more likely to explain the progression 
caused by AD pathology than SVD. The co-existence of global SVD and AD 
pathologies did not affect the individual association of Aβ on HV; HV played a 
more important role in the influence of AD pathology on cognition than in SVD.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) 
in cerebrospinal fluid are established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
In other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), these 
biomarkers have also been found to be altered, and the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for these alterations are still under investigation. Moreover, the 
interplay between these mechanisms and the diverse underlying disease states 
remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate genetic contributions to the AD biomarkers and assess 
the commonality and heterogeneity of the associations per underlying disease 
status.
METHODS: We conducted GWAS for the AD biomarkers on subjects from the 
Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the Fox Investigation for New 
Discovery of Biomarkers (BioFIND), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and meta-analyzed with the largest AD GWAS.[7] We tested 
heterogeneity of associations of interest between different disease statuses 
(AD, PD, and control).
RESULTS: We observed three GWAS signals: the APOE locus for Aβ, the 3q28 locus 
between GEMC1 and OSTN for p-tau and t-tau, and the 7p22 locus (top hit: 
rs60871478, an intronic variant for DNAAF5 , also known as HEATR2 ) for p-tau. 
The 7p22 locus is novel and co-localized with the brain DNAAF5 expression. While 
no heterogeneity from underlying disease status was observed for the above GWAS 
signals, some disease risk loci suggested disease specific associations with 
these biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a novel association at the intronic region of 
DNAAF5 associated with increased levels of p-tau across all diseases. We also 
observed some disease specific genetic associations with these biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Synaptic degeneration has been suggested as an early pathological 
event that strongly correlates with severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, changes in longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) as a synaptic biomarker in the AD 
continuum remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the trajectory of CSF GAP-43 with AD progression and its 
association with other AD hallmarks.
METHODS: CSF GAP-43 was analyzed in 788 participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 246 cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals, 415 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 127 with 
AD dementia based on cognitive assessments. The associations between a 
multimodal classification scheme with amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and 
neurodegeneration, and changes in CSF GAP-43 over time were also analyzed.
RESULTS: CSF GAP-43 levels were increased at baseline in MCI and dementia 
patients, and increased significantly over time in the preclinical (Aβ-positive 
CN), prodromal (Aβ-positive MCI), and dementia (Aβ-positive dementia) stages of 
AD. Higher levels of CSF GAP-43 were also associated with higher CSF 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and total tau (t-tau), cerebral amyloid deposition 
and hypometabolism on positron emission tomography, the hippocampus and middle 
temporal atrophy, and cognitive performance deterioration at baseline and 
follow-up. Furthermore, CSF GAP-43 may assist in effectively predicting the 
probability of dementia onset at 2- or 4-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: CSF GAP-43 can be used as a potential biomarker associated with 
synaptic degeneration in subjects with AD; it may also be useful for tracking 
the disease progression and for monitoring the effects of clinical trials.

Background: APOE is the largest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), but there is a substantial polygenic component as well. Polygenic 
risk scores (PRS) can summarize small effects across the genome but may obscure 
differential risk associated with different molecular processes and pathways. 
Variability at the genetic level may contribute to the extensive phenotypic 
heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we examine polygenic risk 
impacting specific pathways associated with AD and examined its relationship 
with clinical status and AD biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration 
(A/T/N). Methods: A total of 1,411 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with genotyping data were included. Sets of 
variants identified from a pathway analysis of AD GWAS summary statistics were 
combined into clusters based on their assigned pathway. We constructed 
pathway-specific PRSs for each participant and tested their associations with 
diagnostic status (AD vs cognitively normal), abnormal levels of amyloid and 
ptau (positive vs negative), and hippocampal volume. The APOE region was 
excluded from all PRSs, and analyses controlled for APOE -ε4 carrier status. 
Results: Thirteen pathway clusters were identified relating to categories such 
as immune response, amyloid precursor processing, protein localization, lipid 
transport and binding, tyrosine kinase, and endocytosis. Eight pathway-specific 
PRSs were significantly associated with AD dementia diagnosis. 
Amyloid-positivity was associated with endocytosis and fibril formation, 
response misfolded protein, and regulation protein tyrosine PRSs. Ptau 
positivity and hippocampal volume were both related to protein localization and 
mitophagy PRS, and ptau positivity was additionally associated with an immune 
signaling PRS. A global AD PRS showed stronger associations with diagnosis and 
all biomarkers compared to pathway PRSs, suggesting a strong synergistic effect 
of all loci contributing to the global AD PRS. Conclusions: Pathway PRS may 
contribute to understanding separable disease processes, but do not appear to 
add significant power for predictive purposes. These findings demonstrate that, 
although genetic risk for AD is widely distributed, AD-phenotypes may be 
preferentially associated with risk in specific pathways. Defining genetic risk 
along multiple dimensions at the individual level may help clarify the 
etiological heterogeneity in AD.

Understanding the psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer s disease (AD) is crucial 
for advancing precision medicine and therapeutic strategies. The relationship 
between AD behavioral symptoms and asymmetry in spatial tau PET patterns is not 
well-known. Braak tau progression implicates the temporal lobes early. However, 
the clinical and pathological implications of temporal tau laterality remain 
unexplored. This cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between 
temporal tau PET asymmetry and behavior assessed using the neuropsychiatric 
inventory and composite scores for memory, executive function, and language, 
using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. 
In the entire cohort, continuous right and left temporal tau contributions to 
behavior and cognition were evaluated, controlling for age, sex, education, and 
tau burden on the contralateral side. Additionally, a temporal tau laterality 
index was calculated to define "asymmetry-extreme" groups (individuals with 
laterality indices greater than two standard deviations from the mean). 695 
individuals (age = 73.9 ± 7.6 years, 372 (53.5 %) females) were included, 
comprising 281 (40%) cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid negative, 185 (27%) CU 
amyloid positive, and 229 (33%) impaired (CI) amyloid positive participants. In 
the full cohort analysis, right temporal tau was associated with worse behavior 
(B = 8.14, p-value = 0.007), and left temporal tau was associated with worse 
language (B = 1.4, p-value < 0.001). Categorization into asymmetry-extreme 
groups revealed 20 right- and 27 left-asymmetric participants. Within these 
extreme groups, there was additional heterogeneity along the anterior-posterior 
dimension. Asymmetrical tau burden is associated with distinct behavioral and 
cognitive profiles. Wide multi-cultural implementation of social cognition 
measures is needed to understand right-sided asymmetry in AD.

OBJECTIVE: Metabolic biomarkers can potentially inform disease progression in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study is to identify and describe 
a new set of diagnostic biomarkers for developing deep learning (DL) tools to 
predict AD using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry 
(UPLC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics data.
METHODS: A total of 177 individuals, including 78 with AD and 99 with cognitive 
normal (CN), were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort along with 150 metabolomic biomarkers. We performed feature 
selection using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The 
H2O DL function was used to build multilayer feedforward neural networks to 
predict AD.
RESULTS: The LASSO selected 21 metabolic biomarkers. To develop DL models, the 
21 biomarkers identified by LASSO were imported into the H2O package. The data 
was split into 70% for training and 30% for validation. The best DL model with 
two layers and 18 neurons achieved an accuracy of 0.881, F1-score of 0.892, and 
AUC of 0.873. Several metabolomic biomarkers involved in glucose and lipid 
metabolism, in particular bile acid metabolites, were associated with APOE-ε4 
allele and clinical biomarkers (Aβ42, tTau, pTau), cognitive assessments [the 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS13), the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)], and hippocampus volume.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a new set of diagnostic metabolomic 
biomarkers for developing DL tools to predict AD. These biomarkers may help with 
early diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, and/or early treatment 
interventions for patients at risk for AD.

The biological definition of Alzheimer's disease using CSF biomarkers requires 
abnormal levels of both amyloid (A) and tau (T). However, biomarkers and 
corresponding cutoffs may not always reflect the presence or absence of 
pathology. Previous studies suggest that up to 32% of individuals with 
autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease show normal CSF p-tau levels in vivo, but 
these studies are sparse and had small sample sizes. Therefore, in three 
independent autopsy cohorts, we studied whether or not CSF A+T- excluded 
Alzheimer's disease based on autopsy. We included 215 individuals, for whom 
ante-mortem CSF collection and autopsy had been performed, from three cohorts: 
(i) the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC) [n = 80, 37 (46%) Alzheimer's disease at 
autopsy, time between CSF collection and death 4.5 ± 2.9 years]; (ii) the 
Antwerp Dementia Cohort (DEM) [n = 92, 84 (91%) Alzheimer's disease at autopsy, 
time CSF collection to death 1.7 ± 2.3 years]; and (iii) the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [n = 43, 31 (72%) Alzheimer's disease at autopsy, 
time CSF collection to death 5.1 ± 2.5 years]. Biomarker profiles were based on 
dichotomized CSF Aβ1-42 and p-tau levels. The accuracy of CSF AT profiles to 
detect autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease was assessed. Lastly, we 
investigated whether the concordance of AT profiles with autopsy diagnosis 
improved when CSF was collected closer to death in 9 (10%) DEM and 30 (70%) ADNI 
individuals with repeated CSF measurements available. In total, 50-73% of A+T- 
individuals and 100% of A+T+ individuals had Alzheimer's disease at autopsy. 
Amyloid status showed the highest accuracy to detect autopsy-confirmed 
Alzheimer's disease (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the ADC: 88%, 92% 
and 84%; in the DEM: 87%, 94% and 12%; and in the ADNI cohort: 86%, 90% and 75%, 
respectively). The addition of CSF p-tau did not further improve these 
estimates. We observed no differences in demographics or degree of Alzheimer's 
disease neuropathology between A+T- and A+T+ individuals with autopsy-confirmed 
Alzheimer's disease. All individuals with repeated CSF measurements remained 
stable in Aβ1-42 status during follow-up. None of the Alzheimer's disease 
individuals with a normal p-tau status changed to abnormal; however, four (44%) 
DEM individuals and two (7%) ADNI individuals changed from abnormal to normal 
p-tau status over time, and all had Alzheimer's disease at autopsy. In summary, 
we found that up to 73% of A+T- individuals had Alzheimer's disease at autopsy. 
This should be taken into account in both research and clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology presents decades before 
dementia manifests, unbiased biomarker cut-points may more closely reflect 
presence of pathology than clinically defined cut-points. Currently, unbiased 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau cut-points are lacking.
METHODS: We investigated CSF t-tau and p-tau cut-points across the clinical 
spectrum using Gaussian mixture modelling, in two independent cohorts (Amsterdam 
Dementia Cohort and ADNI).
RESULTS: Individuals with normal cognition (NC) (total n = 1111), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) (total n = 1213) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) (total 
n = 1524) were included. In both cohorts, four CSF t- and p-tau distributions 
and three corresponding cut-points were identified. Increasingly high tau 
subgroups were characterized by steeper MMSE decline and higher progression risk 
to AD (cohort/platform-dependent HR, t-tau 1.9-21.3; p-tau 2.2-9.5).
LIMITATIONS: The number of subjects in some subgroups and subanalyses was small, 
especially in the highest tau subgroup and in tau PET analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In two independent cohorts, t-tau and p-tau levels showed four 
subgroups. Increasingly high tau subgroups were associated with faster clinical 
decline, suggesting our approach may aid in more precise prognoses.

The Rho GTPase activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26) gene has been reported to be 
associated with neuropsychiatric diseases and neurodegenerative diseases 
including Parkinson's disease. We examined whether the ARHGAP26 gene is 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the associations of 
154 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ARHGAP26 gene with AD and 
CVD using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. 
Fourteen SNPs were associated with AD (top SNP rs3776362 with p = 3.43 × 10-3), 
while 37 SNPs revealed associations with CVD (top SNP rs415235 with 
p = 2.06 × 10-4). Interestingly, 13 SNPs were associated with both AD and CVD. 
SNP rs3776362 was associated with CVD, Functional Activities Questionnaire 
(FAQ), and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). A replication study 
using a Caribbean Hispanics sample showed that 17 SNPs revealed associations 
with AD, and 12 SNPs were associated with CVD. The third sample using a 
family-based study design showed that 9 SNPs were associated with AD, and 3 SNPs 
were associated with CVD. SNP rs6836509 within the ARHGAP10 gene (an important 
paralogon of ARHGAP26) was associated with AD and cerebrospinal fluid total tau 
(t-tau) level in the ADNI sample. Several SNPs were functionally important using 
the RegulomeDB, while a number of SNPs were associated with significant 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) databases. In conclusion, genetic variants within ARHGAP26 were 
associated with AD and CVD. These findings add important new insights into the 
potentially shared pathogenesis of AD and CVD.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has suggested that iron accumulation plays an 
important role in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the potential mechanism remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the associations of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) ferritin, an indicator for brain iron load, with neurodegenerative 
and inflammatory changes in AD.
METHODS: The study involved 302 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). They were classified as normal controls (A-T-N-, 
n = 48), AD continuum (A+TN-, n = 46; A+TN+, n = 166), and suspected non-AD 
pathology (A-TN+, n = 42), according to the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) 
system. Group comparisons of CSF ferritin among groups were performed using 
one-way ANOVA. Linear regression models were used to test the relationships 
between CSF ferritin and cognitive assessments, and the associations between CSF 
ferritin and other biomarkers, respectively.
RESULTS: We found that CSF ferritin showed significant differences among the ATN 
groups, with higher concentration in more advanced categories (A+TN+). 
Furthermore, CSF ferritin level was independently related to cognitive 
performance (MMSE, ADAS-Cog13, and ADNI-mem). Linear regression analysis 
indicated positive relationships between CSF ferritin and phosphorylated tau and 
total tau, rather than Aβ42. Significant associations were revealed between CSF 
ferritin and inflammatory proteins, including TNF-α, TNFR1, TNFR2, ICAM1, VCAM1, 
TGF-β1, IL-9, and IP-10, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insight into iron dysfunction in AD 
pathology and highlight elevated brain iron as a possible mechanism of 
neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation along AD continuum.

INTRODUCTION: Patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often go 
on to develop dementia, however many do not. Although cognitive tests are widely 
used in the clinic, there is limited research on their potential to help predict 
which patients may progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) from those that do not.
METHODS: MCI patients (n = 325) from the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-2) dataset were tracked across a 5 year period. 
Upon initial diagnosis, all patients underwent a series of cognitive tests 
including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog 
13). Twenty-five percent (n = 83) of those initially diagnosed with MCI 
subsequently developed AD within 5 years.
RESULTS: We showed that those individuals that progressed to AD had 
significantly lower scores upon baseline testing on the MMSE and MoCA, and 
higher scores on the ADAS-13, compared to those that did not convert. However, 
not all tests were equivalent. We showed that the ADAS-13 offers the best 
predictability of conversion (Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR) = 3.91). This 
predictability was higher than that offered by the two primary biomarker 
Amyloid-beta (Aβ, AOR = 1.99) and phospho-tau (Ptau, AOR = 1.72). Further 
analysis on the ADAS-13 showed that MCI patients that subsequently converted to 
AD performed particularly poorly on delayed-recall (AOR = 1.93), word 
recognition (AOR = 1.66), word finding difficulty (AOR = 1.55) and orientation 
(1.38) test items.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive testing using the ADAS-13 may offer a simpler, less 
invasive, more clinically relevant and a more effective method of determining 
those that are in danger of converting from MCI to AD.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of metabolomics makes it possible to study the 
characteristic changes of peripheral metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Recent studies have found that the levels of valine are related to mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
AIMS: This study aimed to further clarify the characteristics of valine levels 
in MCI and AD.
METHODS: A total of 786 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort were selected to evaluate the relationships between 
serum valine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain structure (magnetic 
resonance imaging, MRI), cerebral glucose metabolism 
(18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, FDG-PET), and cognitive 
declines, through different cognitive subgroups.
RESULTS: Serum valine was decreased in patients with AD compared with cognitive 
normal (CN) and stable MCI (sMCI), and in progressive MCI (pMCI) compared with 
CN. Serum valine was negatively correlated with CSF total tau (t-tau) and 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in pMCI. Serum valine significantly predicted 
conversion from MCI to AD. In addition, serum valine was related to the rate of 
change of cerebral glucose metabolism during the follow-up period in pMCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum valine may be a peripheral biomarker of pMCI and AD, and its 
level predicts the progression of MCI to AD. Our study may help to reveal the 
metabolic changes during AD disease trajectory and its relationship to clinical 
phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Despite the striking efforts in investigating neurobiological 
factors behind the acquisition of amyloid-β (A), protein tau (T), and 
neurodegeneration ([N]) biomarkers, the mechanistic pathways of how AT[N] 
biomarkers spreading throughout the brain remain elusive.
OBJECTIVE: To disentangle the massive heterogeneities in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) progressions and identify vulnerable/critical brain regions to AD 
pathology.
METHODS: In this work, we characterized the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers and 
their propagation across brain networks using a novel bistable 
reaction-diffusion model, which allows us to establish a new systems biology 
underpinning of AD progression. We applied our model to large-scale longitudinal 
neuroimages from the ADNI database and studied the systematic vulnerability and 
criticality of brains.
RESULTS: Our model yields long term prediction that is statistically significant 
linear correlated with temporal imaging data, produces clinically consistent 
risk prediction, and captures the Braak-like spreading pattern of AT[N] 
biomarkers in AD development.
CONCLUSIONS: Our major findings include (i) tau is a stronger indicator of 
regional risk compared to amyloid, (ii) temporal lobe exhibits higher 
vulnerability to AD-related pathologies, (iii) proposed critical brain regions 
outperform hub nodes in transmitting disease factors across the brain, and (iv) 
comparing the spread of neuropathological burdens caused by amyloid-β and tau 
diffusions, disruption of metabolic balance is the most determinant factor 
contributing to the initiation and progression of AD.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a late-life risk factor for cognitive decline. 
Evidence suggests an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated 
pathologic changes and depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of AT(N) biomarker profile (amyloid-β 
[A], p-tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) and gender on cross-sectional 
associations between subclinical depressive symptoms and cognitive function 
among older adults without dementia.
METHODS: Participants included 868 individuals without dementia from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Depressive symptoms were 
measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). ADNI neuropsychological 
composite scores assessed memory and executive function (EF). PET, cerebrospinal 
fluid, and MRI modalities classified the study sample into biomarker profiles: 
normal biomarkers (A-T-N-), AD continuum (A+T±N±), and suspect non-AD pathology 
(SNAP; A-T±N-or A-T-N±). Multivariate regression models were used to investigate 
associations between GDS and cognitive domains.
RESULTS: GDS was negatively associated with memory (β= -0.156, p < 0.001) and EF 
(β= -0.147, p < 0.001) in the whole sample. When classified by biomarker 
profile, GDS was negatively associated with memory and EF in AD continuum 
(memory: β= -0.174, p < 0.001; EF: β= -0.129 p = 0.003) and SNAP (memory: 
β= -0.172, p = 0.005; EF: β= -0.197, p = 0.001) subgroups. When stratified by 
sex, GDS was negatively associated with memory (β= -0.227, p < 0.001) and EF 
(β= -0.205, p < 0.001) in men only.
CONCLUSION: The association between subclinical depressive symptoms and 
cognitive function is highly influenced by the AT(N) biomarker profile.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) promotes neuronal survival downstream. 
This longitudinal study evaluated whether the TNFRSF1B gene encoding TNFR2 and 
levels of its soluble form (sTNFR2) affect Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers and 
clinical outcomes. Data analyzed included 188 patients in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and AD dementia. Further, a replication study was performed in 48 patients with 
MCI with positive AD biomarkers who were treated at a memory clinic. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTNFR2 levels along with two related TNFRSF1B gene 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs976881 and rs1061622 were assessed. 
General linear models were used to evaluate the effect of CSF sTNFR2 levels and 
each SNP in relationship to CSF t-tau and p-tau, cognitive domains, MRI brain 
measures, and longitudinal cognitive changes after adjustments were made for 
covariates such as APOE ε4 status. In the ADNI cohort, a significant interaction 
between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF t-tau and p-tau levels; 
hippocampal and whole brain volumes; and Digit Span Forwards subtest scores. In 
the replication cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 modulates CSF p-tau. A significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 also impacts Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores over 12 months 
in the ADNI cohort. The interaction between TNFRSF1B variant rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 levels was noted to modulate multiple AD-associated severity markers and 
cognitive domains. This interaction impacts resilience-related clinical outcomes 
in AD and lends support to sTNFR2 as a promising candidate for therapeutic 
targeting to improve clinical outcomes of interest.

Successful cognitive aging is often thought to result from resistance to the 
accumulation of pathology, resilience to the effects of pathological 
accumulation, or some combination of the two. While evidence for resilience has 
been found in typical aging populations, the oldest-old provide us with a unique 
window into the role of pathological accumulation in impacting cognition. Here, 
we aimed to assess group differences in measures of amyloid and tau across older 
age groups using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 
age: 60-89) and The 90+ Study (age: 90-101). Additionally, using the ADNI 
dataset, we performed exploratory analyses of regional cingulate AV-45 SUVRs to 
assess if amyloid load in particular areas was associated with Top Cognitive 
Performance (TCP). Consistent with the literature, results showed no group 
differences in amyloid SUVRs both regionally and in the whole cortex. For tau 
with AV-1451, we also observed no differences in Braak composite SUVRs. 
Interestingly, these relationships persisted in the oldest-old. This indicates 
that Top Cognitive Performance throughout aging does not reflect resistance to 
amyloid and tau burden, but that other mechanisms may be associated with 
protection against amyloid and tau related neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) and chitinase-3-like protein 1 
(CHI3L1 or YKL-40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are newly discovered markers 
indicating neuronal damage and microglial activation, respectively. 
Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) reflects the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and is useful as diagnostic markers for AD. However, it is unknown whether 
these biomarkers have similar or complementary information in AD.
METHODS: We stratified 121 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN), stable 
mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), progressive MCI (pMCI), and dementia due to 
AD. Analysis of covariance (ANOVA) and chi-square analyses, Spearman 
correlation, and logistic regression models were performed to test the 
demographic, associations between biomarkers, and diagnostic accuracies, 
respectively. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of 
CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) on above biomarkers within diagnostic groups, the combination 
of diagnostic group and Aβ status as predictor, and CSF biomarkers as predictors 
of AD features, including cognition measured by Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) and brain structure and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measured by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: P-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 were all predictors of AD diagnosis, but 
combinations of biomarkers did not improve the diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.924 
for p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40) compared to p-tau (AUC 0.922). P-tau and VILIP-1 
were highly correlated (r = 0.639, p < 0.001) and strongly associated with Aβ 
pathology across clinical stages of AD, while YKL-40 was correlated with Aβ 
pathology in CN and AD groups. VILIP-1 was associated with acceleration of 
cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and expansion of ventricles in 
longitudinal analyses. YKL-40 was associated with hippocampal atrophy at 
baseline and follow-up, while p-tau was only associated with worsening WMH at 
baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF levels of p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 may have utility for 
discriminating between cognitively normal subjects and patients with AD. 
Increased levels of both VILIP-1 and YKL-40 may be associated with disease 
degeneration. These CSF biomarkers should be considered for future assessment in 
the characterization of the natural history of AD.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the complex connection between 
apathy and cognitive decline that remains unclear. A total of 1057 non-dementia 
elderly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
received up to 13 years of follow-up and were divided into an apathy negative 
(-) group of 943 participants and an apathy positive (+) group of 114 
participants through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-apathy subitem. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and amyloid β (Aβ) PET were measured, 
and their longitudinal changes were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. 
Risk factors for cognitive decline and apathy conversion were explored through 
the Cox proportional hazards model. Mediation effects of Aβ pathology on 
cognition were investigated using the causal mediation analysis. Apathy syndrome 
was associated with faster impairment of cognition and elevation of the Aβ 
burden. The effects of apathy on cognitive function and life quality were 
mediated by Aβ pathology, including CSF Aβ42/total tau ratio, and Aβ deposition 
in the prefrontal regions. Apathy syndrome was the risk factor for cognitive 
deterioration; meanwhile, frontal Aβ burden was the risk factor for apathy 
conversion. Apathy syndrome is an early manifestation of cognitive decline and 
there are bidirectional roles between apathy syndrome and Aβ pathology. 
Prefrontal Aβ pathology influenced the pathway from apathy to cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal atrophy (HA) is one of the biomarkers for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To identify the best biomarkers and develop models for prediction of 
HA over 24 months using baseline data.
METHODS: The study included healthy elderly controls, subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment, and subjects with AD, obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1) and the Australian Imaging Biomarkers 
and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) databases. Predictor variables 
included cognitive and neuropsychological tests, amyloid-β, tau, and p-tau from 
cerebrospinal fluid samples, apolipoprotein E, and features extracted from 
magnetic resonance images (MRI). Least-mean-squares regression with elastic net 
regularization and least absolute deviation regression models were tested using 
cross-validation in ADNI 1. The generalizability of the models including only 
MRI features was evaluated by training the models with ADNI 1 and testing them 
with AIBL. The models including the full set of variables were not evaluated 
with AIBL because not all needed variables were available in it.
RESULTS: The models including the full set of variables performed better than 
the models including only MRI features (root-mean-square error (RMSE) 1.76-1.82 
versus 1.93-2.08). The MRI-only models performed well when applied to the 
independent validation cohort (RMSE 1.66-1.71). In the prediction of 
dichotomized HA (fast versus slow), the models achieved a reasonable prediction 
accuracy (0.79-0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: These models can potentially help identifying subjects predicted to 
have a faster HA rate. This can help in selection of suitable patients into 
clinical trials testing disease-modifying drugs for AD.

We aim to better characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with 
suspected non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (SNAP) based on their 
longitudinal outcome, cognition, biofluid, and neuroimaging profile. MCI 
participants (n = 361) from ADNI-GO/2 were designated "amyloid positive" with 
abnormal amyloid-beta 42 levels (AMY+) and "neurodegeneration positive" (NEU+) 
with abnormal hippocampal volume or hypometabolism using 
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. SNAP was compared with the 
other MCI groups and with AMY- controls. AMY-NEU+/SNAP, 16.6%, were older than 
the NEU- groups but not AMY- controls. They had a lower conversion rate to AD 
after 24 months than AMY+NEU+ MCI participants. SNAP-MCI participants had 
similar amyloid-beta 42 levels, florbetapir and tau levels, but larger white 
matter hyperintensity volumes than AMY- controls and AMY-NEU- MCI participants. 
SNAP participants performed worse on all memory domains and on other cognitive 
domains, than AMY-NEU- participants but less so than AMY+NEU+ participants. 
Subthreshold levels of cerebral amyloidosis are unlikely to play a role in 
SNAP-MCI, but pathologies involving the hippocampus and cerebrovascular disease 
may underlie the neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in this group.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has come to be recognized as a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with poorly understood underlying mechanisms. We 
hypothesized that a history of TBI would be associated with greater tau 
deposition in elders with high-risk for dementia. A Groups of 20 participants 
with self-reported history of TBI and 100 without any such history were scanned 
using [18F]-AV1451 positron emission tomography as part of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Scans were stratified into four groups 
according to TBI history, and by clinical dementia rating scores into 
cognitively normal (CDR = 0) and those showing cognitive decline (CDR ≥ 0.5). We 
pursued voxel-based group comparison of [18F]-AV1451 uptake to identify the 
effect of TBI history on brain tau deposition, and for voxel-wise correlation 
analyses between [18F]-AV1451 uptake and different neuropsychological measures 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Compared to the TBI-/CDR ≥ 0.5 group, 
the TBI+/CDR ≥ 0.5 group showed increased tau deposition in the temporal pole, 
hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior and middle temporal gyri. Furthermore, 
the extent of tau deposition in the brain of those with TBI history positively 
correlated with the extent of cognitive decline, CSF-tau, and CSF-amyloid. This 
might suggest TBI to increase the risk for tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease 
later in life.

INTRODUCTION:  Our goal was to determine whether cognitive and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) markers of tau and amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ42) differ between 
Vietnam-era veterans with and without history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
and whether TBI moderates the association between CSF markers and neurocognitive 
functioning.
METHODS:  A total of 102 male participants (52 TBI, 50 military controls [MCs]; 
mean age = 68) were included. Levels of CSF Aβ42, tau phosphorylated at the 
threonine 181 position (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) were quantified. Group 
differences in CSF markers and cognition as well as the moderating effect of TBI 
on CSF and cognition associations were explored.
RESULTS:  Relative to MCs, the TBI group showed significantly higher p-tau 
(P = .01) and t-tau (P = .02), but no differences in amyloid (P = .09). TBI 
history moderated the association between CSF tau and performance on a measure 
of processing speed (t-tau: P  = .04; p-tau: P  = .02).
DISCUSSION:  Tau accumulation may represent a mechanism of dementia risk in 
older veterans with remote TBI.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and biomarker characteristics of patients 
with amyloid-negative Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a prospective 
cohort study.
METHODS: We first investigated the reliability of florbetapir- PET in patients 
with AD and patients with MCI using CSF-Aβ1-42 as a comparison amyloid 
measurement. We then compared florbetapir- vs florbetapir+ patients with respect 
to several AD-specific biomarkers, baseline and longitudinal cognitive 
measurements, and demographic and clinician report data.
RESULTS: Florbetapir and CSF-Aβ1-42 +/- status agreed for 98% of ADs (89% of 
MCIs), indicating that most florbetapir- scans were a reliable representation of 
amyloid status. Florbetapir- AD (n = 27/177; 15%) and MCI (n = 74/217, 34%) were 
more likely to be APOE4-negative (MCI 83%, AD 96%) than their florbetapir+ 
counterparts (MCI 30%, AD 24%). Florbetapir- patients also had less AD-specific 
hypometabolism, lower CSF p-tau and t-tau, and better longitudinal cognitive 
performance, and were more likely to be taking medication for depression. In MCI 
only, florbetapir- participants had less hippocampal atrophy and hypometabolism 
and lower functional activity questionnaire scores compared to florbetapir+ 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, image analysis problems do not appear to be a primary 
explanation of amyloid negativity. Florbetapir- ADNI patients have a variety of 
clinical and biomarker features that differ from their florbetapir+ 
counterparts, suggesting that one or more non-AD etiologies (which may include 
vascular disease and depression) account for their AD-like phenotype.

BACKGROUND: The blood biomarker neurofilament light (NFL) is one of the most 
widely used for monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to recent 
research, a higher NFL plasma level has a substantial predictive value for 
cognitive deterioration in AD patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an 
MRI-based approach for detecting neurodegeneration, white matter 
(WM) disruption, and synaptic damage. There have been few studies on the 
relationship between plasma NFL and WM microstructure integrity.
AIMS: The goal of the current study is to assess the associations between plasma 
levels of NFL, CSF total tau, phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181), and amyloid-β 
(Aβ) with WM microstructural alterations.
METHODS: We herein have investigated the cross-sectional association between 
plasma levels of NFL and WM microstructural alterations as evaluated by DTI in 
92 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) provided by Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. We analyzed the potential 
association between plasma NFL levels and radial diffusivity (RD), axial 
diffusivity (AxD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) in each 
region of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) atlas, using 
simple linear regression models stratified by age, sex, and APOE ε4 genotype.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated a significant association between plasma NFL 
levels and disrupted WM microstructure across the brain. In distinct areas, 
plasma NFL has a negative association with FA in the fornix, fronto-occipital 
fasciculus, corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, internal capsule, and corona 
radiata and a positive association with RD, AxD, and MD values in sagittal 
stratum, corpus callosum, fronto-occipital fasciculus, corona radiata, internal 
capsule, thalamic radiation, hippocampal cingulum, fornix, and cingulum. Lower 
FA and higher RD, AxD, and MD values are related to demyelination and 
degeneration in WM.
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that the level of NFL in the blood is linked 
to WM alterations in MCI patients. Plasma NFL has the potential to be a 
biomarker for microstructural alterations. However, further longitudinal studies 
are necessary to validate the predictive role of plasma NFL in cognitive 
decline.

INTRODUCTION: Impaired self-awareness of memory function, a.k.a. anosognosia, is 
a common symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, its pathological 
correlates remain unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of amyloid and tau 
on memory self-awareness.
METHODS: Two hundred thirty-six clinically normal (N) and 102 impaired (I) 
participants from the ADNI cohort were included. Amyloid (global) and tau burden 
(in entorhinal and inferior temporal cortices) were assessed using positron 
emission tomography (PET). Self-awareness of memory was assessed using 
discrepancy indexes of subjective participant-informant ratings, as well as 
participant-objective scores of memory performance. Subjective and objective 
values were derived from the Everyday Cognition memory questionnaire and Logical 
Memory (delayed recall).
RESULTS: Lower awareness (both methods) of memory function was associated with 
higher levels of pathology in the I group as compared to N. There was a 
significant effect of tauopathy, but not amyloidosis, on individual complaint, 
such that higher levels of tau associated with lower awareness.
DISCUSSION: Impaired self-awareness appears progressively in the evolution of 
the disease related to AD biomarkers. Discordant subjective and objective 
measures may be important for clinical consideration.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating reports have suggested that α-synuclein is involved in 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
α-synuclein has been suggested as a potential biomarker of AD, this study was 
set out to test whether CSF α-synuclein is associated with other AD biomarkers 
and could predict neurodegeneration and clinical progression in non-demented 
elders.
METHODS: The associations between CSF α-synuclein and other AD biomarkers were 
investigated at baseline in non-demented Chinese elders. The predictive values 
of CSF α-synuclein for longitudinal neuroimaging change and the conversion risk 
of non-demented elders were assessed using linear mixed effects models and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, respectively, in the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
RESULTS: The CSF α-synuclein levels correlated with AD-specific biomarkers, CSF 
total tau and phosphorylated tau levels, in 651 Chinese Han participants 
(training set). These positive correlations were replicated in the ADNI database 
(validation set). Using a longitudinal cohort from ADNI, the CSF α-synuclein 
concentrations were found to increase with disease severity. The CSF α-synuclein 
had high diagnostic accuracy for AD based on the "ATN" (amyloid, tau, 
neurodegeneration) system (A + T+ versus A - T - control) (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84). Moreover, CSF α-synuclein 
predicted longitudinal hippocampus atrophy and conversion from MCI to AD 
dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF α-synuclein is associated with CSF tau levels and could predict 
neurodegeneration and clinical progression in non-demented elders. This finding 
indicates that CSF α-synuclein is a potentially useful early biomarker for AD.

Background: National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 
proposed the AT(N) system based on β-amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and 
neurodegeneration, which considered the definition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
as a biological construct. However, the associations between different AT(N) 
combinations and cognitive progression have been poorly explored systematically. 
The aim of this study is to compare different AT(N) combinations using 
recognized biomarkers within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort. Methods: A total of 341 participants were classified into 
cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 200) and cognitively impaired (CI; n = 141) 
groups according to the clinical manifestations and neuropsychological tests. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and amyloid-PET ([18F]flutemetamol) were used as 
biomarkers for A; CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tau-PET ([18F]flortaucipir) 
were used as biomarkers for T; CSF total tau (t-tau), hippocampal volume, 
temporal cortical thickness, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and plasma 
neurofilament light (NfL) were used as biomarkers for (N). Binary biomarkers 
were obtained from the Youden index and publicly available cutoffs. Prevalence 
of AT(N) categories was compared between different biomarkers within the group 
using related independent sample non-parametric test. The relationship between 
AT(N) combinations and 12-year longitudinal cognition was assessed using linear 
mixed-effects modeling. Results: Among the CU participants, A-T-(N)- was most 
common. More T+ were detected using p-tau than tau PET (p < 0.05), and more (N)+ 
were observed using fluid biomarkers (p < 0.001). A+T+(N)+ was more common in 
the CI group. Tau PET combined with cortical thickness best predicted cognitive 
changes in the CI group and MRI predicted changes in the CU group. Conclusions: 
These findings suggest that optimal AT(N) combinations to determine longitudinal 
cognition differ by cognitive status. Different biomarkers within a specific 
component for defining AT(N) cannot be used identically. Furthermore, different 
strategies for discontinuous biomarkers will be an important area for future 
studies.

BACKGROUND: The AT(N) research framework for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains 
unclear on how to best deal with borderline cases. Our aim was to characterise 
patients with suspected AD with a borderline Aß1-42/Aß1-40 ratio in 
cerebrospinal fluid.
METHODS: We analysed retrospective data from two cohorts (memory clinic cohort 
and ADNI) of patients (n = 63) with an Aß1-42/Aß1-40 ratio within a 
predefined borderline area-Q1 above the validated cut-off value(grey zone). We 
compared demographic, clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging features 
between grey zone patients and patients with low Aß1-42 (normal Aß ratio but 
pathological Aß1-42, n = 42) and patients with AD (pathological Aß, P-Tau, und 
T-Tau, n = 80).
RESULTS: Patients had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and a median 
age of 72 years. Demographic and general clinical characteristics did not differ 
between the groups. Patients in the grey zone group were the least impaired in 
cognition. However, they overlapped with the low Aß1-42 group in verbal episodic 
memory performance, especially in delayed recall and recognition. The grey zone 
group had less severe medial temporal atrophy, but mild posterior atrophy and 
mild white matter hyperintensities, similar to the low Aß1-42 group.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the Aß ratio grey zone were less impaired, but showed 
clinical overlap with patients on the AD continuum. These borderline patients 
may be at an earlier disease stage. Assuming an increased risk of AD and 
progressive cognitive decline, careful consideration of clinical follow-up is 
recommended when using dichotomous approaches to classify Aß status.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that plasma phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) 
is a highly specific biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related tau 
pathology. It has great potential for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation 
of AD, since it identifies AD with the same accuracy as tau PET and CSF p-tau181 
and predicts the development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
individuals and in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma p-tau181 
may also be used as a biomarker in studies exploring disease pathogenesis, such 
as genetic or environmental risk factors for AD-type tau pathology. The aim of 
the present study was to investigate the relation between polygenic risk scores 
(PRSs) for AD and plasma p-tau181.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was 
used to examine the relation between AD PRSs, constructed based on findings in 
recent genome-wide association studies, and plasma p-tau181, using linear 
regression models. Analyses were performed in the total sample (n = 818), after 
stratification on diagnostic status (CU (n = 236), MCI (n = 434), AD dementia 
(n = 148)), and after stratification on Aβ pathology status (Aβ positives 
(n = 322), Aβ negatives (n = 409)).
RESULTS: Associations between plasma p-tau181 and APOE PRSs (p = 3e-18-7e-15) 
and non-APOE PRSs (p = 3e-4-0.03) were seen in the total sample. The APOE PRSs 
were associated with plasma p-tau181 in all diagnostic groups (CU, MCI, and AD 
dementia), while the non-APOE PRSs were associated only in the MCI group. The 
APOE PRSs showed similar results in amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive and negative 
individuals (p = 5e-5-1e-3), while the non-APOE PRSs were associated with plasma 
p-tau181 in Aβ positives only (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Polygenic risk for AD including APOE was found to associate with 
plasma p-tau181 independent of diagnostic and Aβ pathology status, while 
polygenic risk for AD beyond APOE was associated with plasma p-tau181 only in 
MCI and Aβ-positive individuals. These results extend the knowledge about the 
relation between genetic risk for AD and p-tau181, and further support the 
usefulness of plasma p-tau181 as a biomarker of AD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex is the earliest 
pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this feature has also 
been observed in cognitively normal (CN) individuals and those with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). The precise pathophysiology for the development of 
tau deposition remains unclear. We hypothesized that reduced cerebral perfusion 
is associated with the development of tau deposition.
METHODS: A subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set 
was utilized. Included patients had undergone arterial spin labeling perfusion 
MRI along with [18F]flortaucipir tau PET at baseline, within 1 year of the MRI, 
and a follow-up at 6 years. The association between baseline cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) and the baseline and 6-year tau PET was assessed. Univariate and 
multivariate linear modeling was performed, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the CBF between patients with AD 
and MCI, and CN individuals in the left entorhinal cortex (p=0.013), but not in 
the right entorhinal cortex (p=0.076). The difference in maximum standardized 
uptake value ratio between 6 years and baseline was significantly and inversely 
associated with the baseline mean CBF (p=0.042, R²=0.54) in the left entorhinal 
cortex but not the right entorhinal cortex. Linear modeling demonstrated that 
CBF predicted 6-year tau deposition (p=0.015, R²=0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a reduction in CBF at the 
entorhinal cortex precedes tau deposition. Further work is needed to understand 
the mechanism underlying tau deposition in aging and disease.

We investigated differences due to sex in brain structural volume and cortical 
thickness in older cognitively normal (N=742), cognitively impaired (MCI; N=540) 
and Alzheimer's Dementia (AD; N=402) individuals from the ADNI and AIBL datasets 
(861 Males and 823 Females). General linear models were used to control the 
effect of relevant covariates including age, intracranial volume, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scanner field strength and scanner types. Significant 
volumetric differences due to sex were observed within different cortical and 
subcortical regions of the cognitively normal group. The number of significantly 
different regions was reduced in the MCI group, and no region remained different 
in the AD group. Cortical thickness was overall thinner in males than females in 
the cognitively normal group, and likewise, the differences due to sex were 
reduced in the MCI and AD groups. These findings were sustained after including 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau and phosphorylated tau (pTau) as additional 
covariates.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the key inflammatory pathways that are activated in the 
peripheral and CNS compartments at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with clinical and biomarker 
characteristics consistent with MCI-AD in a discovery cohort, with replication 
in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Inflammatory 
analytes were measured in the CSF and plasma with the same validated multiplex 
analyte platform in both cohorts and correlated with AD biomarkers (CSF Aβ42, 
total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) to identify key inflammatory 
pathway activations. The pathways were additionally validated by evaluating 
genes related to all analytes in coexpression networks of brain tissue 
transcriptome from an autopsy confirmed AD cohort to interrogate if the same 
pathway activations were conserved in the brain tissue gene modules.
RESULTS: Analytes of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (KEGG 
ID:4668) in the CSF and plasma best correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau levels, 
and analytes of the complement and coagulation pathway (KEGG ID:4610) best 
correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels. The top inflammatory signaling pathways of 
significance were conserved in the peripheral and the CNS compartments. They 
were also confirmed to be enriched in AD brain transcriptome gene clusters.
INTERPRETATION: A cell-protective rather than a proinflammatory analyte profile 
predominates in the CSF in relation to neurodegeneration markers among MCI-AD 
patients. Analytes from the TNF signaling and the complement and coagulation 
pathways are relevant in evaluating disease severity at the MCI stage of AD.

BACKGROUND: The earliest stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
defined by low levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ42). However, 
covariance in longitudinal dynamic change of Aβ42 and tau in incipient 
preclinical AD is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To examine dynamic interrelationships between Aβ42 and tau in 
preclinical AD.
METHODS: We followed 47 cognitively intact participants (CI) with available CSF 
data over four years in ADNI. Based on longitudinal Aβ42 levels in CSF, CI were 
classified into three groups: 1) Aβ42 stable with normal levels of Aβ42 over 
time (n = 15); 2) Aβ42 declining with normal Aβ42 levels at baseline but showing 
decline over time (n = 14); and 3) Aβ42 levels consistently abnormal (n = 18).
RESULTS: In the Aβ42 declining group, suggestive of incipient preclinical AD, 
CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) showed a similar longitudinal pattern of 
increasing abnormality over time (p = 0.0001). Correlation between longitudinal 
slopes of Aβ42 and p-tau confirmed that both trajectories were anti-correlated 
(rho = -0.60; p = 0.02). Regression analysis showed that Aβ42 slope (decreasing 
Aβ42) predicted p-tau slope (increasing p-tau) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.03). Atrophy in 
the hippocampus was predicted by the interaction of Aβ42 and p-tau slopes (p < 
 0.0001) only in this incipient preclinical AD group. In all groups combined, 
memory decline was predicted by p-tau.
CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of Aβ42 and p-tau CSF biomarkers in CI subjects 
follows an anti-correlated trajectory, i.e., as Aβ42 declined, p-tau increased, 
and thus was suggestive of strong temporal coincidence. Rapid pathogenic 
cross-talk between Aβ42 and p-tau thus may be evident in very early stages of 
preclinical AD.

Measures of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentrations in 
cerebrospinal fluid are extensively used for diagnostic and research purposes in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) as correlates of cortical thinning and cognitive 
outcomes. The present study investigated the relationship of Aβ and p-tau with 
hippocampal subfield volumes Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1-4, dentate gyrus (DG), and 
subiculum. Subfields were segmented from T1-weighted images from the 
ADNI-population using FreeSurfer v6. Linear and polynomial regression models 
revealed distinct associations of Aβ and p-tau with subfield volumes. Aβ had a 
quadratic relationship with all hippocampal subfield volumes and the inflection 
point was higher than the validated cut-off for Aβ. For p-tau the relationships 
were linear, except for CA3, in which it was quadratic. For the CA1 and CA3, 
these quadratic relationships with Aβ were only observed when p-tau was low. 
Amyloid and p-tau contributed equally to the explained variance in CA4 and DG 
volume. Subicular volume was best explained by Aβ alone. These biomarker 
relationships with hippocampal subfield volumes seem to mirror the 
hippocampal-specific topography of Aβ and tau reported in neuropathological 
staging models. In addition, using continuous values of Aβ reveals positive 
patterns with imaging markers for individuals around the positivity threshold 
that would be masked when using dichotomized biomarker groups, which can be 
important for early detection and accurate inclusion of potential participants 
at risk for AD in clinical trials.

Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), also known as significant memory 
concern (SMC), has been suggested as a manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
preceding mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study assessed the impact of 
gender on cognition, amyloid accumulation, the volumes of hippocampus, 
entorhinal cortex (EC), fusiform and medial temporal lobe (MTA) and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathology biomarkers in patients reporting SMC. 
Methods: Twenty-nine males (mean age ± SD: 72.3 ± 5.7 years) and 40 females 
(mean age ± SD: 71.0 ± 5.1 years) with SMC from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were included in the study. We explored the gender discrepancies in 
cognition, [18F] AV45 amyloid positivity, volumes of hippocampus, EC, fusiform 
and MTA and CSF biomarkers. Results: Compared with females, males showed 
significantly worse performance in Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 
(ADAS-13; P = 0.004) and lower amyloid deposition (P < 0.001). However, females 
showed greater advantage on the task of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-5 
(RAVLT-5) sum (P = 0.021), RAVLT-immediate recall (P = 0.010) and reduced 
volumes of the hippocampus, EC, fusiform and MTA (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 
0.001, P = 0.007) than males. No gender differences were found in CSF Aβ42, CSF 
Tau and CSF P-tau (P = 0.264, P = 0.454, P = 0.353). Conclusions: These findings 
highlight that gender discrepancies should be considered in the interpretation 
of cognitive measures when evaluating SMC.

IMPORTANCE: Fluid and imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) are often 
used interchangeably, but some biomarkers may reveal earlier stages of disease.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize individuals with tau abnormality indicated by 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assay or positron emission tomography (PET).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2010 and 2019, 322 participants in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent CSF and PET 
assessments of tau pathology. Data-driven, clinically relevant thresholds for 
CSF phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (≥26.64 pg/mL) and flortaucipir-PET meta-regions 
of interest (ROI) (standard uptake value ratio ≥1.37) indicated participants' 
tau status as CSF-/PET-, CSF+/PET-, CSF-/PET+, and CSF+/PET+. Of 1659 ADNI 
participants with a CSF or flortaucipir assessment, 588 had both measures (1071 
were excluded). Among these, 266 were further excluded because they did not have 
flortaucipir and CSF testing within less than 25 months, leaving 322 for 
analysis. Of these, 213 were cognitively unimpaired (CU); 98 had mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI); and 11 had AD dementia.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We compared tau-positive vs tau-negative groups as 
indicated by either modality or demographic and clinical variables, amyloid 
β-PET burden, and flortaucipir-PET binding across Braak stage-related ROIs. We 
also compared 5-year rates of CSF P-tau accumulation and cognitive decline prior 
to flortaucipir-PET scanning.
RESULTS: Among the 322 study participants, 180 were women (56%), and the mean 
(SD) age was 73.08 (7.37) years. Two hundred ten participants were CSF-/PET- 
(65%); 63 were CSF+/PET- (19.5%); 15 were CSF-/PET+ (4.6%); and 34 were 
CSF+/PET+ (10.5%). Most CSF-/PET+ participants had measures near CSF or PET tau 
thresholds. The CSF+/PET- participants showed faster 5-year accrual of P-tau and 
increased flortaucipir-PET binding in early Braak ROIs but similar memory 
decline compared with CSF-/PET- participants. Tau-positive individuals by either 
measure showed increased amyloid β-PET burden. All CSF+/PET+ individuals were 
amyloid-positive, and 26 had MCI or AD dementia (76%). Compared with the 
CSF-/PET- group, CSF+/PET+ individuals had experienced faster 5-year accrual of 
CSF P-tau and decline in memory and executive function, resulting in reduced 
cognitive abilities at the time of flortaucipir-PET assessment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Suprathreshold CSF P-tau without flortaucipir-PET 
abnormality may indicate a stage of AD development characterized by early tau 
abnormality without measurable loss in cognitive performance. Persons with both 
tau CSF and PET abnormality appear to have reduced cognitive capacities 
resulting from faster antecedent cognitive decline. Elevation of CSF P-tau 
appears to precede flortaucipir-PET positivity in the progression of AD 
pathogenesis and related cognitive decline.

OBJECTIVES: CSF levels of Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p are potential early 
diagnostic markers for probable Alzheimer disease (AD). The influence of genetic 
variation on these markers has been investigated for candidate genes but not on 
a genome-wide basis. We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF 
biomarkers (Aβ1-42, t-tau, p-tau181p, p-tau181p/Aβ1-42, and t-tau/Aβ1-42).
METHODS: A total of 374 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort with quality-controlled CSF and genotype 
data were included in this analysis. The main effect of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) under an additive genetic model was assessed on each of 5 
CSF biomarkers. The p values of all SNPs for each CSF biomarker were adjusted 
for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. We focused on SNPs with 
corrected p<0.01 (uncorrected p<3.10×10(-8)) and secondarily examined SNPs with 
uncorrected p values less than 10(-5) to identify potential candidates.
RESULTS: Four SNPs in the regions of the APOE, LOC100129500, TOMM40, and EPC2 
genes reached genome-wide significance for associations with one or more CSF 
biomarkers. SNPs in CCDC134, ABCG2, SREBF2, and NFATC4, although not reaching 
genome-wide significance, were identified as potential candidates.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to known candidate genes, APOE, TOMM40, and one 
hypothetical gene LOC100129500 partially overlapping APOE; one novel gene, EPC2, 
and several other interesting genes were associated with CSF biomarkers that are 
related to AD. These findings, especially the new EPC2 results, require 
replication in independent cohorts.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of self-reported clinical diagnosis of 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on longitudinal changes in brain amyloid PET and 
CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau) in cognitively normal (NL), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) elderly.
METHODS: Longitudinal study with mean follow-up time of 2.52 ± 0.51 years. Data 
were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Participants included 516 NL, 798 MCI, and 325 AD elderly. Main 
outcomes were annual rate of change in brain amyloid burden (i.e. longitudinal 
increases in florbetapir PET uptake or decreases in CSF Aβ42 levels); and tau 
protein aggregation (i.e. longitudinal increases in CSF total tau [T-tau] and 
phosphorylated tau [P-tau]). Adjusted multilevel mixed effects linear regression 
models with randomly varying intercepts and slopes was used to test whether the 
rate of biomarker change differed between participants with and without OSA.
RESULTS: In NL and MCI groups, OSA+ subjects experienced faster annual increase 
in florbetapir uptake (B = .06, 95% CI = .02, .11 and B = .08, 95% CI = .05, 
.12, respectively) and decrease in CSF Aβ42 levels (B = -2.71, 95% CI = -3.11, 
-2.35 and B = -2.62, 95% CI = -3.23, -2.03, respectively); as well as increases 
in CSF T-tau (B = 3.68, 95% CI = 3.31, 4.07 and B = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.58, 2.86, 
respectively) and P-tau (B = 1.221, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.42 and B = 1.74, 95% CI = 
1.22, 2.27, respectively); compared with OSA- participants. No significant 
variations in the biomarker changes over time were seen in the AD group.
CONCLUSIONS: In both NL and MCI, elderly, clinical interventions aimed to treat 
OSA are needed to test if OSA treatment may affect the progression of cognitive 
impairment due to AD.

BACKGROUND: Reduced signal on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) is a valid proxy for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Perivascular space (PVS) is believed to be associated with AD pathology and 
cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associations of PVS with FDG-PET 
and cognitive performance based on the burden of amyloid pathology.
METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). MRI-visible PVS in basal ganglia (BG) 
and centrum semi-oval (CSO) were visually classified as: none/mild, moderate or 
frequent/severe. The association of PVS with brain FDG-PET was explored based on 
the burden of amyloid pathology, where a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) t-tau/Aβ42 
with the ratio≥0.27 was defined as high amyloid pathology. Moreover, the 
relationships between PVS and cognitive performance variables (ADNI-MEM and 
ADNI-EF) were studied.
RESULTS: For participants with higher tau/Aβ42 ratio, CSO-PVS severity was 
independently associated with lower FDG-PET. There were significant interaction 
effects between moderate or frequent/severe CSO-PVS and time on FDG decline in 
people with high amyloid pathology. The interaction between CSO-PVS and time 
(follow-up) was consistently associated with ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF decline in 
individuals with high amyloid pathology.
CONCLUSION: The study established the differential utility of PVS in BG and CSO 
for predicting brain metabolism. These findings suggest that CSO-PVS serves as a 
contributing factor to brain metabolism and cognitive decline associated with 
amyloid pathology.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To elaborate a new algorithm to establish a 
standardized method to define cutoffs for CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer disease 
(AD) by validating the algorithm against CSF classification derived from PET 
imaging.
METHODS: Low and high levels of CSF phosphorylated tau were first identified to 
establish optimal cutoffs for CSF β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide biomarkers. These Aβ 
cutoffs were then used to determine cutoffs for CSF tau and phosphorylated tau 
markers. We compared this algorithm to a reference method, based on tau and 
amyloid PET imaging status (ADNI study), and then applied the algorithm to 10 
large clinical cohorts of patients.
RESULTS: A total of 6,922 patients with CSF biomarker data were included (mean 
[SD] age: 70.6 [8.5] years, 51.0% women). In the ADNI study population (n = 
497), the agreement between classification based on our algorithm and the one 
based on amyloid/tau PET imaging was high, with Cohen's kappa coefficient 
between 0.87 and 0.99. Applying the algorithm to 10 large cohorts of patients (n 
= 6,425), the proportion of persons with AD ranged from 25.9% to 43.5%.
DISCUSSION: The proposed novel, pragmatic method to determine CSF biomarker 
cutoffs for AD does not require assessment of other biomarkers or assumptions 
concerning the clinical diagnosis of patients. Use of this standardized 
algorithm is likely to reduce heterogeneity in AD classification.

BACKGROUND: A substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease do not harbor amyloid pathology. We analyzed the presence 
and extent of tau deposition and neurodegeneration in amyloid-positive (AD) and 
amyloid-negative (nonAD) ADNI subjects while also taking into account age of 
onset (< or > 65 years) as we expected that the emerging patterns could vary by 
age and presence or absence of brain amyloidosis.
METHODS: One hundred and ten early-onset AD (EOAD), 121 EOnonAD, 364 late-onset 
AD (LOAD), and 175 LOnonAD mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (DEM) 
subjects were compared to 291 ADNI amyloid-negative control subjects using 
voxel-wise regression in SPM12 with cluster-level family-wise error correction 
at pFWE < 0.05). A subset of these subjects also received 18F-flortaucipir scans 
and allowed for analysis of global tau burden.
RESULTS: As expected, relative to LOAD, EOAD subjects showed more extensive 
neurodegeneration and tau deposition in AD-relevant regions. EOnonADMCI showed 
no significant neurodegeneration, while EOnonADDEM showed bilateral medial and 
lateral temporal, and temporoparietal hypometabolism. LOnonADMCI and LOnonADDEM 
showed diffuse brain atrophy and a fronto-temporo-parietal hypometabolic 
pattern. LOnonAD and EOnonAD subjects failed to show significant tau binding.
CONCLUSIONS: LOnonAD subjects show a fronto-temporal neurodegenerative pattern 
in the absence of tau binding, which may represent underlying hippocampal 
sclerosis with TDP-43, also known as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 
encephalopathy (LATE). The hypometabolic pattern observed in EOnonADDEM seems 
similar to the one observed in EOADMCI. Further investigation into the 
underlying etiology of EOnonAD is warranted.

Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62 is a multifunctional scaffolding protein and plays a 
major role in the cellular processes of autophagy, upregulation of which has 
been shown in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). To investigate its genetic effects and relationship with AD pathologies, 
we analyzed the genetic associations of SQSTM1 rs4935 with the risk of AD and 
the levels of AD biomarkers using the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
Database. We further analyzed the distribution pattern of p62 immunoreactivity 
in relation to AD pathologies in the postmortem human brain tissues from AD and 
non-AD controls. We found that SQSTM1 rs4935 was not associated with the risk of 
AD, but its T allele was significantly associated with decreased β-amyloid 
(1-42) (Aβ42) levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD (β = 
-9.336, p = 0.022). In addition, p62 immunoreactivity in AD is increased, but it 
shows an inverse relationship to Aβ deposition. A small proportion of senile 
plaques show p62 positive neurites. Our results suggest that SQSTM1/p62 may play 
an important role in the progression of AD via associations with Aβ42 levels in 
CSF and Aβ deposition in the brain of patients with AD.

BACKGROUND: Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with worse 
outcomes, yet no established biomarkers exist for early diagnosis and 
intervention. We compared tau PET burden across older individuals with and 
without psychotic symptoms.
METHODS: [18F]AV1451 tau PET binding was compared between 26 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects with psychotic symptoms (delusions 
and/or hallucinations) and 26 ADNI subjects without psychotic symptoms, matched 
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and clinical severity. Tau was assessed on a 
region-of-interest and voxel level, corrected for amyloid PET burden.
RESULTS: Tau was greater in individuals with psychotic symptoms in the amygdala 
in region-of-interest analyses, and in amygdala, thalamus, putamen, right 
hippocampus, right entorhinal cortex, and right frontal cortex in voxel-based 
analyses. When considering different onset and type of psychotic symptoms, tau 
binding was greatest in those with concurrent delusions.
CONCLUSION: Elevated tau in limbic regions may be relevant for psychotic 
symptoms in aging and AD.

BACKGROUND: Tau aggregation demonstrates close associations with hypometabolism 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although differing pathophysiological processes may 
underlie their development.
OBJECTIVE: To establish whether tau deposition and glucose metabolism have 
different trajectories in AD progression and evaluate the utility of global 
measures of these pathological hallmarks in predicting cognitive deficits.
METHODS: 279 participants with amyloid-β (Aβ) status, and T1-weighted MRI scans, 
were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(http://adni.loni.usc.edu). We created the standard uptake value ratio images 
using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 for [18F]AV1451-PET (tau) and 
[18F]FDG-PET (glucose metabolism) scans. Voxel-wise group and single-subject 
level SPM analysis evaluated the relationship between global [18F]FDG-PET and 
[18F]AV1451-PET depending on the Aβ status. Linear models assessed whether tau 
deposition or glucose metabolism better predicted clinical progression.
RESULTS: There was a dissociation between global cerebral glucose hypometabolism 
and global tau load in amyloid-positive AD and amyloid-negative mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) (p > 0.05). Global hypometabolism was only associated with 
global cortical tau in amyloid-positive MCI. Voxel-level single subject tau load 
better predicted neuropsychological performance, Alzheimer's disease assessment 
scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) 13 score, and one-year change compared with regional 
and global hypometabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: A dissociation between tau pathology and glucose metabolism at a 
global level in AD could imply that other pathological processes influence 
glucose metabolism. Furthermore, as tau is a better predictor of clinical 
progression, these processes may have independent trajectories and require 
independent consideration in the context of therapeutic interventions.

Higher body mass index (BMI) in late-life has recently been considered as a 
possible protective factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which yet remains 
conflicting. To test this hypothesis, we have evaluated the cross-sectional and 
longitudinal associations of BMI categories with CSF biomarkers, brain β-amyloid 
(Aβ) load, brain structure, and cognition and have assessed the effect of 
late-life BMI on AD risk in a large sample (n = 1,212) of non-demented elderly 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. At 
baseline, higher late-life BMI categories were associated with higher levels of 
CSF Aβ42 (p=0.037), lower levels of CSF total-tau (t-tau, p=0.026) and CSF 
t-tau/Aβ42 (p=0.008), lower load of Aβ in the right hippocampus (p=0.030), as 
well as larger volumes of hippocampus (p<0.0001), entorhinal cortex (p=0.009) 
and middle temporal lobe (p=0.040). But no association was found with CSF 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) or CSF p-tau/Aβ42. Longitudinal studies showed that 
higher BMI individuals experienced a slower decline in cognitive function. In 
addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that higher late-life BMI had 
a reduced risk of progression to AD over time (p = 0.009). Higher BMI in 
late-life decreased the risk of AD, and this process may be driven by AD-related 
biomarkers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the statistical power of plasma, imaging, and 
cognition biomarkers as Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trial outcome 
measures.
METHODS: Plasma neurofilament light, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and 
cognition were measured longitudinally in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) in control (amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42 negative [Aβ-] with 
Clinical Dementia Rating scale [CDR] = 0; n = 330), preclinical AD (Aβ + with 
CDR = 0; n = 218) and mild AD (Aβ + with CDR = 0.5-1; n = 697) individuals. A 
statistical power analysis was performed across biomarkers and groups based on 
longitudinal mixed effects modeling and using several different clinical trial 
designs.
RESULTS: For a 30-month trial of preclinical AD, both the temporal composite and 
hippocampal volumes were superior to plasma neurofilament light and cognition. 
For an 18-month trial of mild AD, hippocampal volume was superior to all other 
biomarkers. Plasma neurofilament light became more effective with increased 
trial duration or sampling frequency. Imaging biomarkers were characterized by 
high slope and low within-subject variability, while plasma neurofilament light 
and cognition were characterized by higher within-subject variability.
INTERPRETATION: MRI measures had properties that made them preferable to 
cognition and pNFL as outcome measures in clinical trials of early AD, 
regardless of cognitive status. However, pNfL and cognition can still be 
effective depending on inclusion criteria, sampling frequency, and response to 
therapy. Future trials will help to understand how sensitive pNfL and MRI are to 
detect downstream effects on neurodegeneration of drugs targeting amyloid and 
tau pathology in AD.

Relationship between serum calcium and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. 
The aim of this study is to test whether serum calcium is associated with other 
AD-associated biomarkers and could predict clinical progression in nondemented 
elders. This was a longitudinal population-based study. The sample was derived 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, which 
included 1224 nondemented elders: 413 cognitively normal (CN) and 811 mild 
cognition impairment (MCI). Associations were investigated between serum calcium 
and longitudinal changes in Aβ/tau pathologic features, brain structure, 
cognitive function, and disease progression. Serum calcium concentrations 
increased with disease severity. Serum calcium predicted longitudinal cognitive 
decline and conversion from nondemented status to AD dementia (adjusted 
HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13-1.76). Furthermore, serum calcium levels were negatively 
correlated with CSF-Aβ42 (β = - 0.558, P = 0.008), FDG-PET (β = - 0.292, 
P < 0.001), whole brain volume (β = - 0.148, P = 0.001), and middle temporal 
volume (β = - 0.216, P = 0.042). Similar results were obtained in CN and MCI 
groups. Higher serum calcium status (even if not hypercalcemia) may increase the 
risk of AD in elders. Serum calcium is a useful biomarker in predicting clinical 
progression in nondemented elders. More researches are needed in the future to 
explore the underlying mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition and MCI 
patients are at increased risk of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to evaluate the associations between polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs) and 1) time to AD progression from MCI, 2) changes in 
longitudinal cognitive impairment, and 3) biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid 
and imaging.
METHODS: We constructed PRS by using 40 independent non-APOE SNPs from 
well-replicated AD GWASs and tested its association with the progression time 
from MCI to AD by using 767 MCI patients from the ADNI study and 1373 patients 
from the NACC study. PRSs calculated with other methods were also computed.
RESULTS: We found that the PRS constructed with SNPs that reached genome-wide 
significance predicted the progression from MCI to AD (beta = 0.182, SE = 0.061, 
p = 0.003) after adjusting for the demographic and clinical variables. This 
association was replicated in the NACC dataset (beta = 0.094, SE = 0.037, 
p = 0.009). Further analyses revealed that PRS was associated with the increased 
ADAS-Cog11/ADAS-Cog13/ADASQ4 scores, tau/ptau levels, and cortical amyloid 
burdens (PiB-PET and AV45-PET), but decreased hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 
volumes (p < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of PRS on the 
increased risk of AD may be mediated by Aβ42 (beta = 0.056, SE = 0.026, 
p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PRS can be useful for the prediction of 
time to AD and other clinical changes after the diagnosis of MCI.

Genome-wide association studies have identified several cholesterol 
metabolism-related genes as top risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
(LOAD). We hypothesized that specific genetic variants could act as 
disease-modifying factors by altering the expression of those genes. Targeted 
association studies were conducted with available genomic, transcriptomic, 
proteomic, and histopathological data from 3 independent cohorts: the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Quebec Founder 
Population (QFP), and the United Kingdom Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC). 
First, a total of 273 polymorphisms located in 17 cholesterol metabolism-related 
loci were screened for associations with cerebrospinal fluid LOAD biomarkers 
beta amyloid, phosphorylated tau, and tau (from the ADNI) and with amyloid 
plaque and tangle densities (from the QFP). Top polymorphisms were then 
contrasted with gene expression levels measured in 134 autopsied healthy brains 
(from the UKBEC). In the end, only SREBF2 polymorphism rs2269657 showed 
significant dual associations with LOAD pathological biomarkers and gene 
expression levels. Furthermore, SREBF2 expression levels measured in LOAD 
frontal cortices inversely correlated with age at death; suggesting a possible 
influence on survival rate.

BACKGROUND: Elevated tau phosphorylation has been linked to the Apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ɛ4 allele, which is considered one of the most significant genes related 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is uncertain whether the impact of 
increased plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) on memory and 
executive function decline would be greater among APOEɛ4 carriers.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of plasma p-tau181 and APOEɛ4 on memory 
and executive function.
METHODS: The longitudinal analysis included 608 older adults without dementia 
(aged 72±7 years; 47% female; follow-up period of 1.59±1.47 years) from the ADNI 
dataset, including 180 individuals with normal cognition and 429 individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment. Linear mixed-effects models were utilized to 
assess the contributions of APOEɛ4 status and plasma p-tau181 to longitudinal 
changes in memory composite score and executive function composite score.
RESULTS: At baseline, the APOEɛ4+/Tau+ group exhibited poorer performance in 
memory composite score and executive function composite score, and an elevated 
load of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ and tau pathologies. To further understand 
longitudinal changes, we compared groups directly based on plasma p-tau181 and 
APOEɛ4 status (four groups: APOEɛ4-/Tau-, APOEɛ4-/Tau+, APOEɛ4+/Tau-, 
APOEɛ4+/Tau+). Both the memory composite score and executive function composite 
score showed a significantly greater decline in the APOEɛ4+/Tau+ group than in 
all other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that there is an interaction between plasma 
p-tau181 levels and APOEɛ4 status, which contributes to the longitudinal changes 
of memory and executive function in older adults without dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the factors underpinning discordant 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ)42 versus p-tau181/Aβ42 or CSF Aβ42 
versus Aβ positron emission tomography (PET).
METHODS: We stratified 570 non-demented Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) participants by Aβ PET and further by CSF Aβ42 or 
p-tau181/Aβ42. We used analysis of covariance testing adjusting for covariates, 
followed by Tukey post hoc pairwise comparisons, to compare CSF soluble 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (sTREM2) across four 
participant groups: CSF+ Aβ42 with CSF- p-tau/Aβ42, CSF- Aβ42 with CSF+ 
p-tau/Aβ42, and concordant CSFAβ42/CSFp-tau/Aβ42. We also compared sTREM2 across 
discordant and concordant CSFAβ42/PET.
RESULTS: Regardless of Aβ PET status, CSF+Aβ42 with CSF-p-tau/Aβ42 had lower 
sTREM2 than CSF-Aβ42 with CSF+p-tau/Aβ42. CSF sTREM2 was similarly also 
associated with discordant CSF Aβ42 /PET.
DISCUSSION: Our study suggests the potential roles of sTREM2 in discordant CSF 
Aβ42 and p-tau181/Aβ42 and discordant CSFAβ42/PET. Low- and high-CSF sTREM2 may 
affect the accuracy of p-tau181/Aβ42 during the clinical work-up of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: 17% of non-demented older adults had discordant CSF Aβ42 versus 
p-tau181/Aβ42.sTREM2 differed between discordant cases of CSF Aβ42 versus 
p-tau181/Aβ42.20% of non-demented older adults had discordant CSF Aβ42 versus Aβ 
PET.sTREM2 also differed between discordant cases of CSF Aβ42 versus Aβ 
PET.p-tau181/Aβ42 may miss 6.7% of PET+ non-demented older adults with low 
sTREM2.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe cognitive decline and 
pathological changes in the brain (brain atrophy, hyperphosphorylation of tau, 
and deposition of amyloid-beta protein). Females have greater neuropathology (AD 
biomarkers and brain atrophy rates) and cognitive decline than males, however 
these effects can depend on diagnosis (amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) 
or AD) and APOE genotype (presence of ε4 alleles). Using the ADNI database 
(N = 630 females, N = 830 males), we analyzed the effect of sex, APOE genotype 
(non-carriers or carriers of APOEε4 alleles), and diagnosis (cognitively normal 
(CN), early aMCI (EMCI), late aMCI (LMCI), probable AD) on cognition (memory and 
executive function), hippocampal volume, and AD biomarkers (CSF levels of 
amyloid beta, tau, and ptau). Regardless of APOE genotype, memory scores were 
higher in CN, EMCI, and LMCI females compared to males but this sex difference 
was absent in probable AD, which may suggest a delay in the onset of cognitive 
decline or diagnosis and/or a faster trajectory of cognitive decline in females. 
We found that, regardless of diagnosis, CSF tau-pathology was disproportionately 
elevated in female carriers of APOEε4 alleles compared to males. In contrast, 
male carriers of APOEε4 alleles had reduced levels of CSF amyloid beta compared 
to females, irrespective of diagnosis. We also detected sex differences in 
hippocampal volume but the direction was dependent on the method of correction. 
Altogether results suggest that across diagnosis females show greater memory 
decline compared to males and APOE genotype affects AD neuropathology 
differently in males and females which may influence sex differences in 
incidence and progression of aMCI and AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is 
phenotypically heterogeneous. APOE is a triallelic gene which correlates with 
phenotypic heterogeneity in AD. In this work, we determined the effect of APOE 
alleles on the disease progression timeline of AD using a discriminative 
event-based model (DEBM). Since DEBM is a data-driven model, stratification into 
smaller disease subgroups would lead to more inaccurate models as compared to 
fitting the model on the entire dataset. Hence our secondary aim is to propose 
and evaluate novel approaches in which we split the different steps of DEBM into 
group-aspecific and group-specific parts, where the entire dataset is used to 
train the group-aspecific parts and only the data from a specific group is used 
to train the group-specific parts of the DEBM. We performed simulation 
experiments to benchmark the accuracy of the proposed approaches and to select 
the optimal approach. Subsequently, the chosen approach was applied to the 
baseline data of 417 cognitively normal, 235 mild cognitively impaired who 
convert to AD within 3 years, and 342 AD patients from the Alzheimers Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to gain new insights into the effect of 
APOE carriership on the disease progression timeline of AD. In the ε4 carrier 
group, the model predicted with high confidence that CSF Amyloidβ42 and the 
cognitive score of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) are early 
biomarkers. Hippocampus was the earliest volumetric biomarker to become 
abnormal, closely followed by the CSF Phosphorylated Tau181 (PTAU) biomarker. In 
the homozygous ε3 carrier group, the model predicted a similar ordering among 
CSF biomarkers. However, the volume of the fusiform gyrus was identified as one 
of the earliest volumetric biomarker. While the findings in the ε4 carrier and 
the homozygous ε3 carrier groups fit the current understanding of progression of 
AD, the finding in the ε2 carrier group did not. The model predicted, with 
relatively low confidence, CSF Neurogranin as one of the earliest biomarkers 
along with cognitive score of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Amyloid β42 
was found to become abnormal after PTAU. The presented models could aid 
understanding of the disease, and in selecting homogeneous group of 
presymptomatic subjects at-risk of developing symptoms for clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau are crucial biomarkers in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, interacting synergistically to accelerate 
disease progression. While Aβ initiates cascades leading to tau 
hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles, PET imaging studies suggest a 
sequential progression from amyloidosis to tauopathy, closely linked with 
neurocognitive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the complex interactions between Aβ and tau in AD using 
probabilistic graphical models, assessing how regional tau accumulation is 
influenced by Aβ burden.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
Anti-Aβ Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study were utilized, 
involving participants across various cognitive stages and employing both 
Florbetapir and Flortaucipir as tracers. Tau standardized uptake value ratio 
values were harmonized across studies, and participants were stratified into 
quantile groups based on Aβ levels. A LASSO regularized Gaussian graphical model 
analyzed partial correlations among brain regions to discern patterns of tau 
accumulation across different Aβ levels.
RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in tau structure 
among low, medium, and high Aβ groups in both ADNI and A4 cohorts, with graph 
metrics, such as small-world coefficient, indicating increased tau efficiency as 
Aβ burden increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that tau accumulates more efficiently with 
increasing Aβ burden, highlighting an interplay that could inform development of 
dual-targeting therapies in AD. This study underscores the importance of Aβ and 
tau interactions in AD progression and supports the hypothesis that targeting 
both pathologies could be crucial for therapeutic interventions.

INTRODUCTION: While the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) susceptibility has been studied extensively, much less is known 
about the differences in disease presentation in APOE ε4 carriers versus 
non-carriers.
METHODS: To help elucidate these differences, we performed a broad analysis 
comparing the regional levels of six different neuroimaging biomarkers in the 
brains of APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers who participated in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: We observed significant APOE ε4-associated heterogeneity in regional 
amyloid beta deposition, tau accumulation, glucose uptake, brain volume, 
cerebral blood flow, and white matter hyperintensities within each AD diagnostic 
group. We also observed important APOE ε4-associated differences in cognitively 
unimpaired individuals who converted to mild cognitive impairment/AD versus 
those who did not convert.
DISCUSSION: This observed heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers between APOE 
ε4 carriers versus non-carriers may have important implications regarding the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD in different subpopulations.
HIGHLIGHTS: An extensive study was performed on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
ε4-associated heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Robust APOE ε4-associated increases in amyloid 
beta (Aβ) deposition throughout the brain, in every diagnostic group, were 
observed. APOE ε4-associated increases in tau pathology, decreases in glucose 
uptake, and increases in brain atrophy, which expand in regional scope and 
magnitude with disease progression, were observed. Significant sex- and 
age-related differences in APOE ε4-associated neuroimaging biomarker 
heterogeneity, with overall increases in pathological presentation in female 
APOE ε4 carriers, were observed. Regional differences in Aβ deposition, tau 
accumulation, glucose uptake, ventricle size, and white matter hyperintensities 
were observed in cognitively normal participants who converted to mild cognitive 
impairment/Alzheimer's disease, which may hold potential predictive value.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral (plasma) and central (cerebrospinal fluid, CSF) measures 
of tau are higher in Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to prodromal stages and 
controls. While elevated CSF tau concentrations have been shown to be associated 
with lower grey matter density (GMD) in AD-specific regions, this correlation 
has yet to be examined for plasma in a large study.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the neuroanatomical correlates of plasma tau using 
voxel-based analysis.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data for 508 ADNI participants were collected for 
clinical, plasma total-tau (t-tau), CSF amyloid (Aβ42) and tau, and MRI 
variables. The relationship between plasma tau and GMD and between CSF t-tau and 
GMD were assessed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using regression models. Age, sex, 
APOEɛ4 status, diagnosis, and total intracranial volume were used as covariates 
where appropriate. Participants were defined as amyloid positive (Aβ+) if CSF 
Aβ42 was <192 pg/mL.
RESULTS: Plasma tau was negatively correlated with GMD in the medial temporal 
lobe (MTL), precuneus, thalamus, and striatum. The associations with thalamus 
and striatum were independent of diagnosis. A negative correlation also existed 
between plasma tau and GMD in Aβ+ participants in the MTL, precuneus, and 
frontal lobe. When compared to CSF t-tau, plasma tau showed a notably different 
associated brain atrophy pattern, with only small overlapping regions in the 
fusiform gyrus.
CONCLUSION: Plasma tau may serve as a non-specific marker for neurodegeneration 
but is still relevant to AD considering low GMD was associated with plasma tau 
in Aβ+ participants and not Aβ-participants.

Neurofilament light (NfL) is a marker of neuroaxonal injury, a prominent feature 
of Alzheimer's disease. It remains uncertain, however, how it relates to amyloid 
and tau pathology or neurodegeneration across the Alzheimer's disease continuum. 
The aim of this study was to investigate how plasma NfL relates to amyloid and 
tau PET and MRI measures of brain atrophy in participants with and without 
cognitive impairment. We retrospectively examined the association between plasma 
NfL and MRI measures of grey/white matter volumes in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI: n = 1149; 382 cognitively unimpaired control 
subjects and 767 cognitively impaired participants (mild cognitive impairment 
n = 420, Alzheimer's disease dementia n = 347)]. Longitudinal plasma NfL was 
measured using single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Cross-sectional 
associations between plasma NfL and PET amyloid and tau measures were 
independently assessed in two cohorts: ADNI [n = 198; 110 cognitively 
unimpaired, 88 cognitively impaired (MCI n = 67, Alzheimer's disease dementia 
n = 21), data accessed October 2018]; and Translational Biomarkers in Aging and 
Dementia [TRIAD, n = 116; 74 cognitively unimpaired, 42 cognitively impaired 
(MCI n = 16, Alzheimer's disease dementia n = 26), data obtained November 2017 
to January 2019]. Associations between plasma NfL and imaging-derived measures 
were examined voxel-wise using linear regression (cross-sectional) and linear 
mixed effect models (longitudinal). Cross-sectional analyses in both cohorts 
showed that plasma NfL was associated with PET findings in brain regions 
typically affected by Alzheimer's disease; associations were specific to amyloid 
PET in cognitively unimpaired and tau PET in cognitively impaired (P < 0.05). 
Longitudinal analyses showed that NfL levels were associated with grey/white 
matter volume loss; grey matter atrophy in cognitively unimpaired was specific 
to APOE ε4 carriers (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that plasma NfL increases 
in response to amyloid-related neuronal injury in preclinical stages of 
Alzheimer's disease, but is related to tau-mediated neurodegeneration in 
symptomatic patients. As such, plasma NfL may a useful measure to monitor 
effects in disease-modifying drug trials.

INTRODUCTION: CSF levels of established Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers 
remain stable despite disease progression, and non-amyloid non-tau biomarkers 
have the potential of informing disease stage and progression. We previously 
identified complement 3 (C3) to be decreased in AD dementia, but this change was 
not found by others in earlier AD stages. We hypothesized that levels of C3 and 
associated factor H (FH) can potentially distinguish between mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and dementia stages of AD, but we also found their levels to be 
influenced by age and disease status.
RESULTS: We developed a biochemical/bioinformatics pipeline to optimize the 
handling of complex interactions between variables in validating biochemical 
markers of disease. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuro-imaging 
Initiative (ADNI, n = 230) to build parallel machine learning models, and 
objectively tested the models in a test cohort (n = 73) of MCI and mild AD 
patients independently recruited from Emory University. Whereas models 
incorporating age, gender, APOE ε4 status, and CSF amyloid and tau levels failed 
to reliably distinguish between MCI and mild AD in ADNI, introduction of CSF C3 
and FH levels reproducibly improved the distinction between the two AD stages in 
ADNI (p < 0.05) and the Emory cohort (p = 0.014). Within each AD stage, the 
final model also distinguished between fast vs. slower decliners (p < 0.001 for 
MCI, p = 0.007 for mild AD), with lower C3 and FH levels associated with more 
advanced disease and faster progression.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that CSF C3 and FH alterations may reflect 
stage-associated biomarker changes in AD, and can complement clinician diagnosis 
in diagnosing and staging AD using the publically available ADNI database as 
reference.

BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), fibrillar tau initially occurs locally 
and progresses preferentially between closely connected regions. However, the 
underlying sources of regional vulnerability to tau pathology remain unclear. 
Previous brain-autopsy findings suggest that the myelin levels-which differ 
substantially between white matter tracts in the brain-are a key modulating 
factor of region-specific susceptibility to tau deposition. Here, we 
investigated whether myelination differences between fiber tracts of the human 
connectome are predictive of the interregional spreading of tau pathology in AD.
METHODS: We included two independently recruited samples consisting of 
amyloid-PET-positive asymptomatic and symptomatic elderly individuals, in whom 
tau-PET was obtained at baseline (ADNI: n = 275; BioFINDER-1: n = 102) and 
longitudinally in a subset (ADNI: n = 123, mean FU = 1.53 [0.69-3.95] years; 
BioFINDER-1: n = 39, mean FU = 1.87 [1.21-2.78] years). We constructed MRI 
templates of the myelin water fraction (MWF) in 200 gray matter ROIs and 
connecting fiber tracts obtained from adult cognitively normal participants. 
Using the same 200 ROI brain-parcellation atlas, we obtained tau-PET ROI values 
from each individual in ADNI and BioFINDER-1. In a spatial regression analysis, 
we first tested the association between cortical myelin and group-average 
tau-PET signal in the amyloid-positive and control groups. Secondly, employing a 
previously established approach of modeling tau-PET spreading based on 
functional connectivity between ROIs, we estimated in a linear regression 
analysis, whether the level of fiber-tract myelin modulates the association 
between functional connectivity and longitudinal tau-PET spreading (i.e., 
covariance) between ROIs.
RESULTS: We found that higher myelinated cortical regions show lower tau-PET 
uptake (ADNI: rho =  - 0.267, p < 0.001; BioFINDER-1: rho =  - 0.175, 
p = 0.013). Fiber-tract myelin levels modulated the association between 
functional connectivity and tau-PET spreading, such that at higher levels of 
fiber-tract myelin, the association between stronger connectivity and higher 
covariance of tau-PET between the connected ROIs was attenuated (interaction 
fiber-tract myelin × functional connectivity: ADNI: β =  - 0.185, p < 0.001; 
BioFINDER-1: β =  - 0.166, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of myelin are associated with lower susceptibility of 
the connected regions to accumulate fibrillar tau. These results enhance our 
understanding of brain substrates that explain regional variation in tau 
accumulation and encourage future studies to investigate potential underlying 
mechanisms.

We evaluated the performance of CSF biomarkers for predicting risk of clinical 
decline and conversion to dementia in non-demented patients with cognitive 
symptoms. CSF samples from patients in two multicentre longitudinal studies 
(ADNI, n = 619; BioFINDER, n = 431) were analysed. Aβ(1-42), tTau and pTau CSF 
concentrations were measured using Elecsys CSF immunoassays, and tTau/Aβ(1-42) 
and pTau/Aβ(1-42) ratios calculated. Patients were classified as biomarker 
(BM)-positive or BM-negative at baseline. Ability of biomarkers to predict risk 
of clinical decline and conversion to AD/dementia was assessed using 
pre-established cut-offs for Aβ(1-42) and ratios; tTau and pTau cut-offs were 
determined. BM-positive patients showed greater clinical decline than 
BM-negative patients, demonstrated by greater decreases in MMSE scores (all 
biomarkers: -2.10 to -0.70). Risk of conversion to AD/dementia was higher in 
BM-positive patients (HR: 1.67 to 11.48). Performance of Tau/Aβ(1-42) ratios was 
superior to single biomarkers, and consistent even when using cut-offs derived 
in a different cohort. Optimal pTau and tTau cut-offs were approximately 
27 pg/mL and 300 pg/mL in both BioFINDER and ADNI. Elecsys pTau/Aβ(1-42) and

BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of 
neuroinflammatory changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology such as 
amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. In fact, genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) have shown a link between genes involved in neuroinflammation and AD. In 
order to further investigate whether interactions between candidate genetic 
variances coding for neuroinflammatory molecules are associated with brain 
amyloid β (Aβ) fibrillary accumulation, we conducted an epistasis analysis on a 
pool of genes associated with molecular mediators of inflammation.
METHODS: [(18)F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was 
employed to assess brain Aβ levels in 417 participants from ADNI-GO/2 and 
posteriorly 174 from ADNI-1. IL-1β, IL4, IL6, IL6r, IL10, IL12, IL18, C5, and C9 
genes were chosen based on previous studies conducted in AD patients. Using the 
[(18)F]florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) as a quantitative 
measure of fibrillary Aβ, epistasis analyses were performed between two sets of 
markers of immune-related genes using gender, diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) as covariates. Voxel-based analyses were also conducted. The results were 
corrected for multiple comparison tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
Aβ1-42/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio concentrations were used to confirm such 
associations.
RESULTS: Epistasis analysis unveiled two significant single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP)-SNP interactions (false discovery rate (FDR) threshold 0.1), 
both interactions between C9 gene (rs261752) and IL6r gene (rs4240872, 
rs7514452). In a combined sample, the interactions were confirmed (p ≤ 10-5) and 
associated with amyloid accumulation within cognitively normal and AD spectrum 
groups. Voxel-based analysis corroborated initial findings. CSF biomarker 
(Aβ1-42/p-tau) confirmed the genetic interaction. Additionally, rs4240872 and 
rs7514452 SNPs were shown to be associated with CSF and plasma concentrations of 
IL6r protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Certain allele combinations involving IL6r and C9 genes are 
associated with Aβ burden in the brain. Hypothesis-driven search for epistasis 
is a valuable strategy for investigating imaging endophenotypes in complex 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease 
with a poorly understood etiology, shown to be partly genetic. Glucose 
hypometabolism, extracellular Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and intracellular 
Tau deposition are cardinal features of AD and display characteristic spatial 
patterns in the brain. We hypothesize that regional differences in underlying 
gene expression confer either resistance or susceptibility to AD pathogenic 
processes and are associated with these spatial patterns. Data-driven methods 
for the identification of genes involved in AD pathogenesis complement 
hypothesis-driven approaches that reflect current theories about the disease. 
Here we present a data driven method for the identification of genes involved in 
AD pathogenesis based on comparing spatial patterns of normal gene expression to 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of glucose hypometabolism, Aβ 
deposition, and Tau deposition.
METHODS: We performed correlations between the cerebral cortex microarray 
samples from the six cognitively normal (CN) post-mortem Allen Human Brain Atlas 
(AHBA) specimens and PET FDG-18, AV-45, and AV-1451 tracer images from AD and CN 
participants in the Alzheimer's Disease and Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Correlation coefficients for each gene by each ADNI subject were then 
entered into a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to determine 
sets that best classified the AD and CN groups. Pathway analysis via BioPlanet 
2019 was then used to infer the function of implicated genes.
RESULTS: We identified distinct sets of genes strongly associated with each PET 
modality. Pathway analyses implicated novel genes involved in mitochondrial 
function, and Notch signaling, as well as genes previously associated with AD.
CONCLUSION: Using an unbiased approach, we derived sets of genes with expression 
patterns spatially associated with FDG hypometabolism, Aβ deposition, and Tau 
deposition in AD. This methodology may complement population-based approaches 
for identifying the genetic underpinnings of AD.

A coding missense mutation (rs3747742) in triggering receptor expressed on 
myeloid cell-like 2 (TREML2) has been recently proposed as an important 
protective factor against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the link between 
TREML2 and AD pathology remains unclear. Therefore, we explored the association 
of TREML2 rs3747742 with cognitive function, neuroimaging biomarkers and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers related to AD, including CSF total-tau 
(T-tau), phosphor-tau (P-tau), and amyloid-β (Aβ1-42). As for cognitive 
function, related cognitive scores of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDRSB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section 11 (ADAS-cog 
11), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) were extracted. We used a multiple linear regression model to examine 
the association of TREML2 rs3747742 with the baseline variables. Furthermore, we 
also calculated the change rate of above variables influenced by TREML2 
rs3747742 via applying a mixed-effects model over a 4-year follow-up. In this 
analysis, a total of 1,306 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database were included. Finally, we observed that only in AD 
patients, but not in normal controls or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
individuals, TREML2 rs3747742 exhibited a strong association with CSF total-tau 
levels at baseline (β = -22.1210, p = 0.0166) and 4-year follow-up (β = -0.3961, 
p = 0.0115). Furthermore, no associations were found with CSF Aβ1-42 levels, 
P-tau levels, neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive function neither for 
baseline variables nor for longitudinal data. Thus, this study indicated that 
TREML2 mediated the risk of AD through influencing AD-related neurodegeneration 
(abnormal T-tau levels) but not P-tau levels and Aβ pathology.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Due to the 
progressive nature of the neurodegeneration associated with the disease, it is 
of clinical interest to achieve an early diagnosis of AD. In this study, we 
analyzed the viability of asymmetry-related measures as potential biomarkers to 
facilitate the early diagnosis of AD. These measures were obtained from 
MAPER-segmented MP-RAGE MRI studies available at the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and by analyzing these studies at the 
level of individual segmented regions. The temporal evolution of these measures 
was obtained and then analyzed by generating spline regression models. Data 
imputation was performed where missing information prevented the temporal 
analysis of each measure from being realized, using additional information 
provided by ADNI for each patient. The temporal evolution of these measures was 
compared to the evolution of other commonly used markers for the diagnosis of 
AD, such as cognitive function, concentrations of Phosphorylated-Tau, Amyloid-β, 
and structural MRI volumetry. The results of the regression models showed that 
asymmetry measures, in particular regions such as the parahippocampal gyrus, 
differentiated themselves temporally before most of the other evaluated 
biomarkers. Further studies are suggested to corroborate these results.

For early detection of Alzheimer's disease, it is important to find biomarkers 
with predictive value for disease progression and clinical manifestations, such 
as cognitive decline. Individuals can now be profiled based on their biomarker 
status for Aβ42 (A) or tau (T) deposition and neurodegeneration (N). The aim of 
this study was to compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging (PET/MR) 
biomarkers in each ATN category and to assess their ability to predict 
longitudinal cognitive decline. A subset of 282 patients, who had had at the 
same time PET investigations with amyloid-β and tau tracers, CSF sampling, and 
structural MRI (18% within 13 months), was selected from the ADNI dataset. The 
participants were grouped by clinical diagnosis at that time: cognitively 
normal, subjective memory concern, early or late mild cognitive impairment, or 
AD. Agreement between CSF (amyloid-β-1-42(A), phosphorylated-Tau181(T), 
total-Tau(N)), and imaging (amyloid-β PET (florbetaben and florbetapir)(A), tau 
PET (flortaucipir)(T), hippocampal volume (MRI)(N)) positivity in ATN was 
assessed with Cohen's Kappa. Linear mixed-effects models were used to predict 
decline in the episodic memory. There was moderate agreement between PET and CSF 
for A biomarkers (Kappa = 0.39-0.71), while only fair agreement for T biomarkers 
(Kappa ≤ 0.40, except AD) and discordance for N biomarkers across all groups 
(Kappa ≤ 0.14) was found. Baseline PET tau predicted longitudinal decline in 
episodic memory irrespective of CSF p-Tau181 positivity (p ≤ 0.02). Baseline PET 
tau and amyloid-β predicted decline in episodic memory (p ≤ 0.0001), but 
isolated PET amyloid-β did not. Isolated PET Tau positivity was only observed in 
2 participants (0.71% of the sample). While results for amyloid-β were similar 
using CSF or imaging, CSF and imaging results for tau and neurodegeneration were 
not interchangeable. PET tau positivity was superior to CSF p-Tau181 and PET 
amyloid-β in predicting cognitive decline in the AD continuum within 3 years of 
follow-up.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a complex signaling protein that 
supports vascular and neuronal function. Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
-neuropathological hallmarks interfere with VEGF signaling and modify previously 
detected positive associations between cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) VEGF and 
cognition and hippocampal volume. However, it remains unknown 1) whether 
regional relationships between VEGF and glucose metabolism and cortical thinning 
exist, and 2) whether AD-neuropathological hallmarks (CSF Aβ, t-tau, p-tau) also 
modify these relationships. We addressed this in 310 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (92 cognitively normal, 149 mild 
cognitive impairment, 69 AD; 215 CSF Aβ+, 95 CSF Aβ-) with regional cortical 
thickness and cognition measurements and 158 participants with FDG-PET. In 
Aβ + participants (CSF Aβ42 ≤ 192 pg/mL), higher CSF VEGF levels were associated 
with greater FDG-PET signal in the inferior parietal, and middle and inferior 
temporal cortices. Abnormal CSF amyloid and tau levels strengthened the positive 
association between VEGF and regional FDG-PET indices. VEGF also had both direct 
associations with semantic memory, as well as indirect associations mediated by 
regional FDG-PET signal to cognition.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have shown that the complement system plays an 
important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether complement 4 (C4) 
protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was associated with AD pathology, 
especially in the early stage of AD, is still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the association of CSF C4 with AD pathology and 
cognition in the preclinical AD.
METHODS: The study included a total of 287 participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Based on the A/T scheme, they 
were divided into four groups to access the changes of CSF C4 in the preclinical 
AD. Linear regression models were used to test the associations between CSF C4 
and AD core biomarkers, namely Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau.
RESULTS: The level of CSF C4 decreased in the A + T- group compared with the 
A-T- group (p = 0.04) and it increased in the A-T+ group compared to the A + T- 
group (p = 0.01). In pooled samples, C4 was significantly associated with AD 
core biomarkers (all p < 0.05), but only in the A + group after stratification 
according to the A/T scheme. Furthermore, CSF C4 levels at baseline were 
associated with longitudinal cognitive changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that CSF C4 levels changed dynamically in the 
preclinical AD, and that the responses of CSF C4 to brain Aβ pathology, tau 
pathology and neurodegeneration were found only in the presence of amyloid 
plaques, both of which indicates the complex link between C4 and AD.

The Plexin-A 4 (PLXNA4) gene, has recently been identified in genome wide 
association studies (GWAS), as a novel genetic player associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, PLXNA4 genetic variations were also 
found to increase AD risk by tau pathology in vitro. However, the potential 
roles of PLXNA4 variants in the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, were not evaluated. 
Five targeted loci capturing the top common variations in PLXNA4, were extracted 
using tagger methods. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore 
whether these variations can affect the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Aβ1-42, 
T-tau, and P-tau) phenotypes in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset. We detected that two loci (rs6467431, rs67468325) were 
significantly associated with CSF Aβ1-42 levels in the hybrid population 
(rs6467431: P = 0.01376, rs67468325: P = 0.006536) and the significance remained 
after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (rs6467431: Pc = 0.03441, 
rs67468325: Pc = 0.03268). In the subgroup analysis, we further confirmed the 
association of rs6467431 in the cognitively normal (CN) subgroup (P = 0.01904, 
Pc = 0.04761). Furthermore, rs6467431-A carriers and rs67468325-G carriers 
showed higher CSF Aβ1-42 levels than non-carriers. Nevertheless, we did not 
detect any significant relationships between the levels of T-tau, P-tau and 
these PLXNA4 loci. Our findings provided preliminary evidence that PLXNA4 
variants can confer AD risk through modulating the Aβ deposition.

BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was created 
to develop standards for brain imaging and biomarkers for diagnosis and 
treatment trials. Using the ADNI dataset, experts have found that low 
cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 (CSF Aβ1-42) concentration and high 
total-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio are highly predictive of progression in amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (aMCI), and recommended these biomarkers to support the 
diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease and select patients for clinical 
trials. However, biomarker selection criteria may introduce systematic bias that 
undermines their utility.
METHODS: We tested for systematic biases among individuals undergoing lumbar 
puncture in the ADNI dataset who fulfilled the following entry criteria: (1) 
aMCI with CSF Aβ1-42 ≤ 192 pG/mL, compared to aMCI with Aβ1-42 > 192 pG/mL, and 
(2) aMCI with total-tau/Aβ1-42 > 0.39, compared to aMCI with total-tau/Aβ1-42 ≤ 
0.39, as well as comparisons between participants with aMCI with and without 
lumbar puncture.
FINDINGS: Individuals with low CSF Aβ1-42 scored significantly poorer than 
individuals with high Aβ1-42 on several baseline measures of disease severity, 
including Logical Memory II (3.24 vs 4.73; p < 0.001), Functional Activities 
Questionnaire (4.30 vs 2.37; p < 0.001), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-cognitive (12.23 vs 10.09; p=0.002). Similar results were found using high 
total-tau/Aβ1-42. No differences were found for individuals with and without 
lumbar puncture except for marital status.
INTERPRETATIONS: Individuals with aMCI with low Aβ1-42 in the ADNI dataset 
appear to have more advanced disease than those with high Aβ1-42. Selection 
criteria based on ADNI, as well as design of future studies, must account for 
potential confounds between biomarker status and disease severity to ensure that 
the former, and not the latter, is the true determinant of predictive accuracy.

We recently discovered three distinct pathophysiological subtypes in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics: one with neuronal 
hyperplasticity, a second with innate immune system activation, and a third 
subtype with blood-brain barrier dysfunction. It remains unclear whether AD 
proteomic subtype profiles are a consequence of amyloid aggregation, or might 
exist upstream from aggregated amyloid. We studied this question in 127 older 
individuals with intact cognition and normal AD biomarkers in two independent 
cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI). We clustered 705 proteins measured in CSF that 
were previously related to AD. We identified in these cognitively intact 
individuals without AD pathology three subtypes: two subtypes were seen in both 
cohorts (n = 49 with neuronal hyperplasticity and n = 44 with blood-brain 
barrier dysfunction), and one only in ADNI (n = 12 with innate immune 
activation). The proteins specific for these subtypes strongly overlapped with 
AD subtype protein profiles (overlap coefficients 92%-71%). Longitudinal 
p181-tau and amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ42) CSF analysis showed that in the 
hyperplasticity subtype p181-tau increased (β = 2.6 pg/mL per year, p = 0.01) 
and Aβ42 decreased over time (β = -4.4 pg/mL per year, p = 0.03), in the innate 
immune activation subtype p181-tau increased (β = 3.1 pg/mL per year, p = 0.01) 
while in the blood-brain barrier dysfunction subtype Aβ42 decreased (β = -3.7 
pg/mL per year, p = 0.009). These findings suggest that AD proteomic subtypes 
might already manifest in cognitively normal individuals and may predispose for 
AD before amyloid has reached abnormal levels.

ABCA7 gene has been identified as a strong genetic locus for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) susceptibility in genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, the 
possible roles of ABCA7 variants in AD pathology were not specifically assessed. 
Using tagger methods, we extracted 15 targeted ABCA7 loci to investigate their 
associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers in 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Finally, although we 
did not detect any significant associations of previously published GWAS SNPs 
(rs3764650 and rs78117248) with all the CSF (Aβ1 - 42, T-tau, and P-tau) and 
neuroimaging markers, three other variants (rs3752242, rs3752240, and rs4147912) 
at ABCA7 loci were detected to show significant associations with amyloid 
deposition on AV-45 PET in brain. Moreover, haplotype and subgroup analysis 
confirmed these significant findings. Furthermore, there were no remarkable 
correlations between ABCA7 variants and neuronal degeneration biomarkers 
(elevated CSF tau, brain structure atrophy, and hypometabolism on imaging) in 
this study. Thus, our study suggested that ABCA7 genotypes contribute to the AD 
risk through involvement in amyloid-β deposition on in vivo imaging, but not in 
tau pathology, brain atrophy, or decreased glucose metabolism.

Accurate, reliable prediction of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential 
for early, disease-modifying therapeutics. Multimodal MRI, such as structural 
and diffusion MRI, is likely to contain complementary information of 
neurodegenerative processes in AD. Here we tested the utility of the multimodal 
MRI (T1-weighted structure and diffusion MRI), combined with high-throughput 
brain phenotyping-morphometry and structural connectomics-and machine learning, 
as a diagnostic tool for AD. We used, firstly, a clinical cohort at a dementia 
clinic (National Health Insurance Service-Ilsan Hospital [NHIS-IH]; N = 211; 110 
AD, 64 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 37 cognitively normal with 
subjective memory complaints [SMC]) to test the diagnostic models; and, 
secondly, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 to test the 
generalizability. Our machine learning models trained on the morphometric and 
connectome estimates (number of features = 34,646) showed optimal classification 
accuracy (AD/SMC: 97% accuracy, MCI/SMC: 83% accuracy; AD/MCI: 97% accuracy) in 
NHIS-IH cohort, outperforming a benchmark model (FLAIR-based white matter 
hyperintensity volumes). In ADNI-2 data, the combined connectome and morphometry 
model showed similar or superior accuracies (AD/HC: 96%; MCI/HC: 70%; AD/MCI: 
75% accuracy) compared with the CSF biomarker model (t-tau, p-tau, and Amyloid 
β, and ratios). In predicting MCI to AD progression in a smaller cohort of 
ADNI-2 (n = 60), the morphometry model showed similar performance with 69% 
accuracy compared with CSF biomarker model with 70% accuracy. Our comparisons of 
the classifiers trained on structural MRI, diffusion MRI, FLAIR, and CSF 
biomarkers showed the promising utility of the white matter structural 
connectomes in classifying AD and MCI in addition to the widely used structural 
MRI-based morphometry, when combined with machine learning.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body diseases (LBD), e.g., Parkinson's disease 
(PD) dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are common causes of 
geriatric cognitive impairments. In addition, AD and LBD are often found in the 
same patients at autopsy; therefore, biomarkers that can detect the presence of 
both pathologies in living subjects are needed. In this investigation, we report 
the assessment of α-synuclein (α-syn) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its 
association with CSF total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and 
amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) in subjects of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI; n = 389), with longitudinal clinical assessments. A strong 
correlation was noted between α-syn and t-tau in controls, as well as in 
patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the correlation 
is not specific to subjects in the ADNI cohort, as it was also seen in PD 
patients and controls enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative 
(PPMI; n = 102). A bimodal distribution of CSF α-syn levels was observed in the 
ADNI cohort, with high levels of α-syn in the subjects with abnormally increased 
t-tau values. Although a correlation was also noted between α-syn and p-tau181, 
there was a mismatch (α-syn-p-tau181-Mis), i.e., higher p-tau181 levels 
accompanied by lower α-syn levels in a subset of ADNI patients. We hypothesize 
that this α-syn-p-tau181-Mis is a CSF signature of concomitant LBD pathology in 
AD patients. Hence, we suggest that inclusion of measures of CSF α-syn and 
calculation of α-syn-p-tau181-Mis improves the diagnostic 
sensitivity/specificity of classic CSF AD biomarkers and better predicts 
longitudinal cognitive changes.

Studies have shown that women on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have 
more pathological tau in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), than men. Some 
studies have found that higher levels of tau biomarkers are more strongly 
associated with clinical AD, cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in women 
than in men. Despite major developments in the use of plasma tau phosphorylated 
at threonine 181 (p-tau181) as an AD biomarker, it is unknown whether these sex 
differences apply to plasma p-tau181. In 1060 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) participants (47% women, 73.8 ± 7.6 years old), we examined 
sex differences in plasma p-tau181 levels and their association with other 
biomarkers, cognitive decline and incident AD. Linear regressions tested for an 
effect of sex on plasma p-tau181 levels and for plasma p-tau181 × sex 
interactions on CSF p-tau181, as well as entorhinal cortex tau, cortical 
amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and brain glucose metabolism, quantified using PET 
imaging. Linear mixed effects models tested for a sex × baseline plasma p-tau181 
interaction on change in cognition over time. Finally, Cox models tested for a 
sex × plasma p-tau181 interaction on the risk of AD dementia in participants who 
were free of dementia at baseline. Despite similar plasma p-tau181 levels 
between sexes, women had lower brain glucose metabolism, greater brain Aβ and 
entorhinal cortex tau deposition, higher CSF p-tau181 and faster cognitive 
decline in relation to higher baseline plasma p-tau181 levels compared with men. 
Among Aβ positive, dementia-free participants, women had higher rates of 
incident AD dementia associated with increasing baseline plasma p-tau181 levels, 
relative to men. Our results suggest that sex may impact the clinical 
interpretation of plasma p-tau181 concentrations. If replicated, these findings 
could have important implications for the use of plasma p-tau181 as an 
accessible AD biomarker and screening tool for preventive and therapeutic 
clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the 
entorhinal regions are key Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers, but the spatial Aβ 
pathways influencing tau pathology remain unclear.
METHODS: We applied predictive modeling to identify Aβ standardized uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) spatial patterns that predict entorhinal tau levels, future 
hippocampal volume, and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) 
scores at 5-year follow-up. The model was trained on Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 237), incorporating amyloid-PET (positron 
emission tomography), tau-PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive 
data, and validated on Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) (N = 276).
RESULTS: The model accurately predicted entorhinal tau levels (r = 0.48, 
p < 0.0001), future hippocampal volume (r = 0.24, p = 0.002), and PACC scores 
(r = 0.35, p < 0.0001) based on regional Aβ.
DISCUSSION: Aβ in the rostral middle frontal, medial orbitofrontal, and striatal 
regions predict entorhinal tau levels, future hippocampal volume, and PACC 
scores, indicating their potential as early biomarkers in AD prediction models.
HIGHLIGHTS: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging reveals amyloid beta (Aβ) 
patterns predicting entorhinal tau levels in preclinical Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Aβ in medial orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and nucleus accumbens 
best predicts tau. Aβ distribution in these regions predicts future hippocampal 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Model validated with Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) data 
sets, showing robustness and reproducibility. Findings suggest early Aβ patterns 
can aid in diagnosing AD and guide anti-Aβ therapies.

BACKGROUND: TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor that is predominantly expressed by 
microglia in the central nervous system. Rare variants in the TREM2 gene 
increase the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble TREM2 
(sTREM2) resulting from shedding of the TREM2 ectodomain can be detected in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is a surrogate measure of TREM2-mediated microglia 
function. CSF sTREM2 has been previously reported to increase at different 
clinical stages of AD, however, alterations in relation to Amyloid β-peptide 
(Aβ) deposition or additional pathological processes in the amyloid cascade 
(such as tau pathology or neurodegeneration) remain unclear. In the current 
cross-sectional study, we employed the biomarker-based classification framework 
recently proposed by the NIA-AA consensus guidelines, in combination with 
clinical staging, in order to examine the CSF sTREM2 alterations at early 
asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of AD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1027 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Imaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 43 subjects carrying TREM2 rare 
genetic variants, was conducted to measure CSF sTREM2 using a previously 
validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ADNI participants were 
classified following the A/T/N framework, which we implemented based on the CSF 
levels of Aβ1-42 (A), phosphorylated tau (T) and total tau as a marker of 
neurodegeneration (N), at different clinical stages defined by the clinical 
dementia rating (CDR) score.
RESULTS: CSF sTREM2 differed between TREM2 variants, whereas the p.R47H variant 
had higher CSF sTREM2, p.L211P had lower CSF sTREM2 than non-carriers. We found 
that CSF sTREM2 increased in early symptomatic stages of late-onset AD but, 
unexpectedly, we observed decreased CSF sTREM2 levels at the earliest 
asymptomatic phase when only abnormal Aβ pathology (A+) but no tau pathology or 
neurodegeneration (TN-), is present.
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ pathology (A) and tau pathology/neurodegeneration (TN) have 
differing associations with CSF sTREM2. While tau-related neurodegeneration is 
associated with an increase in CSF sTREM2, Aβ pathology in the absence of 
downstream tau-related neurodegeneration is associated with a decrease in CSF 
sTREM2.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the 
most common cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide. The exact etiology of 
AD, particularly its genetic mechanisms, remains incompletely understood. 
Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which primarily focus on 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with main effects, provide limited 
explanations for the "missing heritability" of AD, while there is growing 
evidence supporting the important role of epistasis. In this study, we performed 
a genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction detection using a linear regression model and 
employed multiple GPUs for parallel computing, significantly enhancing the speed 
of whole-genome analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau 
(P-tau)/amyloid-[Formula: see text] (A[Formula: see text]) ratio was used as a 
quantitative trait (QT) to enhance statistical power. Age, gender, and clinical 
diagnosis were included as covariates to control for potential non-genetic 
factors influencing AD. We identified 961 pairs of statistically significant 
SNP-SNP interactions, explaining a high-level variance of P-tau/A[Formula: see 
text] level, all of which exhibited marginal main effects. Additionally, we 
replicated 432 previously reported AD-related genes and found 11 gene-gene 
interaction pairs overlapping with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network. Our findings may contribute to partially explain the "missing 
heritability" of AD. The identified subnetwork may be associated with synaptic 
dysfunction, Wnt signaling pathway, oligodendrocytes, inflammation, hippocampus, 
and neuronal cells.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated 
with dementia and is a serious concern for the health of individuals and 
government health care systems worldwide. Gray matter atrophy and white matter 
damage are major contributors to cognitive deficits in AD patients, as 
demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many of these brain changes 
associated with AD begin to occur about 15 years before the onset of initial 
clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is critical to find biomarkers reflective of 
these brain changes associated with AD to identify this disease and monitor its 
prognosis and development. The increased plasma level of hyperphosphorylated tau 
181 (p-tau181) has been recently considered a novel biomarker for the diagnosis 
of AD, preclinical AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the current 
study, we examined the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma 
levels of p-tau181 with structural brain changes in cortical thickness, cortical 
volume, surface area, and subcortical volume in MCI patients. In this 
cross-sectional study, we included the information of 461 MCI patients from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The results of 
voxel-wise partial correlation analyses showed a significant negative 
correlation between the increased levels of plasma p-tau181, CSF total tau, and 
CSF p-tau181 with structural changes in widespread brain regions. These results 
provide evidence for the use of plasma p-tau181 as a diagnostic marker for 
structural changes in the brain associated with the early stages of AD and 
neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Recently, two monoclonal antibodies that lower amyloid plaques have 
shown promising results for the treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These treatments require the 
identification of cognitively impaired older adults with biomarker evidence of 
AD pathology using CSF biomarkers or amyloid-PET. Previous studies showed plasma 
biomarkers (plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181) and hippocampal volume from 
structural MRI correlated with brain amyloid pathology. We hypothesized plasma 
biomarkers with hippocampal volume would identify patients who are suitable 
candidates for disease-modifying therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of plasma AD biomarkers and hippocampal 
atrophy to detect MCI or AD with amyloid pathology confirmed by amyloid-PET or 
CSF biomarkers in ADNI.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative. Participants were aged 55-90 years old with plasma biomarker and 
structural MRI brain data.
MEASUREMENTS: The optimum cut-off point for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and NFL 
and the performance of combined biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy for detecting 
cognitive impairment with brain amyloid pathology were evaluated. The 
association between baseline plasma biomarkers and clinical progression, defined 
by CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and diagnostic conversion over two years, was 
evaluated using a Weibull time-to-event analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 428 participants were included; 167 had normal cognition, 
245 had MCI, and 16 had mild AD. Among MCI and AD, 140 participants had elevated 
amyloid levels by PET or CSF. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 provided the best accuracy 
(sensitivity 79%, specificity 66%, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.77) to detect drug 
candidate participants at baseline. Combined plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and 
hippocampal atrophy increased the specificity for diagnosis (96%), but had lower 
sensitivity (34%), and AUC (0.65). Hippocampal atrophy combined with the 
abnormal plasma p-tau181 or hippocampal atrophy alone showed high sensitivity to 
detect clinical progression (by CDR-SB worsening) of the drug-candidate 
participants within the next 2 years (sensitivity 93% and 89%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers and structural MRI can help identify patients who 
are currently eligible for anti-amyloid treatment and are likely to progress 
clinically, in cases where amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers are not available.

Recently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) YKL-40 levels were reported to be a 
promising candidate biomarker of glial inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
To detect how APOE ε4 affects CSF YKL-40 levels in cognitively normal (CN) 
states, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia, data from 35 CN 
subjects, 63 patients with MCI, and 11 patients with AD from a cross-sectional 
study in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were 
investigated. The results showed that CSF YKL-40 concentrations were increased 
in the AD dementia group than in the CN group. CSF YKL-40 levels were higher in 
APOE ε4 carriers than in noncarriers with MCI. No statistically significant 
difference was found in CSF YKL-40 levels between APOE ε4 carrier and 
noncarriers in AD and CN subjects. CSF YKL-40 concentrations were tightly 
related to CSF tau and p-tau concentrations in the MCI group. Analysis implied 
that APOE ε4 might affect CSF YKL-40 levels in MCI subjects, suggesting a 
crucial role of APOE ε4 in neuroinflammation in detecting individuals who might 
convert to AD from MCI and, thus, as an effective predictive factor.

INTRODUCTION: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the 
earliest Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesion in the brain. Research suggests 
differing functional roles between two EC subregions, the anterolateral EC 
(aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC).
METHODS: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness 
measurements from serial magnetic resonance imaging scans of 775 ADNI-1 
participants (219 healthy; 380 mild cognitive impairment; 176 AD) and use linear 
mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations among cortical 
thickness, disease status, and cognitive measures.
RESULTS: Group status is reliably predicted by aLEC thickness, which also 
exhibits greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. 
Change in aLEC thickness is also associated with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and 
tau levels.
DISCUSSION: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes 
over short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity-it is a 
strong candidate biomarker for detection of early AD.

Immune mechanisms may be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Yet, studies comparing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma immune marker 
levels of healthy and demented individuals have yielded conflicting results. We 
analyzed CSF from 101 members of the parental history-positive PREVENT-AD cohort 
of healthy aging adults, and 237 participants without dementia from the initial 
cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1). Following 
recent practice, we used the biomarkers total-tau and amyloid-β1-42 to allocate 
participants from each study into four stages of AD pathogenesis: Stage 0 (no 
abnormality), Stage 1 (reduced amyloid-β1-42), Stage 2 (reduced amyloid-β1-42 
and increased total-tau), or "Suspected Non-Alzheimer Pathology" (elevated 
total-tau only). Investigating the PREVENT-AD participants' CSF assay results 
for 19 immune/inflammatory markers, we found six that showed a distinct 
bi-directional relationship with pathogenetic stage. Relative to Stage 0, these 
were diminished at Stage 1 but strongly increased at Stage 2. Among the ADNI 
participants (90 healthy controls and 147 with mild cognitive impairment), we 
found that 23 of 83 available CSF markers also showed this distinct pattern. 
These results support recent observations that immune activation may become 
apparent only after the onset of both amyloid and tau pathologies. Unexpectedly, 
they also suggest that immune marker activity may diminish along with earliest 
appearance of amyloid-β plaque pathology. These findings may explain discordant 
results from past studies, and suggest the importance of characterizing the 
extent of AD pathology when comparing clinical groups.

INTRODUCTION: A key goal of the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative 
(ADNI) positron emission tomography (PET) Core is to harmonize quantification of 
β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau PET image data across multiple scanners and tracers.
METHODS: We developed an analysis pipeline (Berkeley PET Imaging Pipeline, 
B-PIP) for ADNI Aβ and tau PET images and applied it to PET data from other 
multisite studies. Steps include image pre-processing, refacing, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)/PET co-registration, visual quality control (QC), 
quantification of tracer uptake, and standardization of Aβ and tau standardized 
uptake value ratios (SUVrs) across tracers.
RESULTS: Measurements from 10,105 cross-sectional and longitudinal Aβ and tau 
PET scans acquired in several studies between 2010 and 2024 can be processed, 
harmonized, and directly merged across tracers and cohorts.
DISCUSSION: The B-PIP developed in ADNI is a scalable image harmonization 
approach used in several observational studies and clinical trials that 
facilitates rigorous Aβ and tau PET quantification and data sharing.
HIGHLIGHTS: Quantitative results from ADNI Aβ and tau PET data are generated 
using a rigorous, scalable image processing pipeline This pipeline has been 
applied to PET data from several other large, multisite studies and trials 
Quantitative outcomes are harmonizable across studies and are shared with the 
scientific community.

An unsupervised region of interest extraction model for tau PET images and its 
application in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Shi R, Wang L, Jiang J.

BACKGROUND: Recently, tau positron-emission tomography (PET) images have been 
widely used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing 
semi-quantitative uptake value ratios (SUVR) calculation is usually based on 
group analysis or specific brain regions from existing templates, which cannot 
detect individual heterogeneity. In this study, we proposed a novel deep 
learning model; called generative adversarial networks constrained multiple loss 
autoencoder for tau (GANCMLAE4TAU), to extract individual regions of interest 
(ROIs) of tau deposition.
METHODS: The basic framework of the proposed model is composed of two encoders, 
one decoder, and one discriminator. Tau PET images of 327 cognitive normal (CN) 
subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to 
train the model and 29 CNs from Huashan Hospital were used as an external 
validation group. The other 57 AD patients and 83 CNs subjects from ADNI were 
used in the classification task. The Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal 
to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were applied to validate the 
robustness of our model. In addition, we conducted a receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis for the SUVR of individual ROIs from the 
GANCMLAE4TAU model and compared it with SUVR of the whole brain and ROIs from 
the templates.
RESULTS: Our model achieved good SSIM (0.963±0.006), PSNR (35.960±3.458) and MSE 
(0.0004±0.0003). In ROC analysis, our model had the highest area under curve 
(AUC) (0.869, 0.809-0.929) in discriminating AD from CN subjects.
CONCLUSION: GANCMLAE4TAU could detect individual ROIs for tau PET images and had 
the potential to be developed as a novel diagnostic tool in the future. Clinical 
Relevance- This method can find individual ROIs of tau depositions, so as to 
achieve more accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Selective vulnerability and resilience to Alzheimer's disease tauopathy as a 
function of genes and the connectome.

Anand C, Torok J, Abdelnour F, Maia PD, Raj A.

Brain regions in Alzheimer's (AD) exhibit distinct vulnerability to the 
disease's hallmark pathology, with the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 
succumbing early to tau tangles while others like primary sensory cortices 
remain resilient. The quest to understand how local/regional genetic factors, 
pathogenesis, and network-mediated spread of pathology together govern this 
selective vulnerability (SV) or resilience (SR) is ongoing. Although many risk 
genes in AD are known from gene association and transgenic studies, it is still 
not known whether and how their baseline expression signatures confer SV or SR 
to brain structures. Prior analyses have yielded conflicting results, pointing 
to a disconnect between the location of genetic risk factors and downstream tau 
pathology. We hypothesize that a full accounting of genes' role in mediating 
SV/SR would require the modeling of network-based vulnerability, whereby tau 
misfolds, aggregates, and propagates along fiber projections. We therefore 
employed an extended network diffusion model (eNDM) and tested it on tau 
pathology PET data from 196 AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Thus the fitted eNDM model becomes a reference 
process from which to assess the role of innate genetic factors. Using the 
residual (observed - model-predicted) tau as a novel target outcome, we obtained 
its association with 100 top AD risk-genes, whose baseline spatial 
transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). 
We found that while many risk genes at baseline showed a strong association with 
regional tau, many more showed a stronger association with residual tau. This 
suggests that both direct vulnerability, related to the network, as well as 
network-independent vulnerability, are conferred by risk genes. We then 
classified risk genes into four classes: network-related SV (SV-NR), 
network-independent SV (SV-NI), network-related SR (SR-NR), and 
network-independent SR (SR-NI). Each class has a distinct spatial signature and 
associated vulnerability to tau. Remarkably, we found from gene-ontology 
analyses, that genes in these classes were enriched in distinct functional 
processes and encompassed different functional networks. These findings offer 
new insights into the factors governing innate vulnerability or resilience in AD 
pathophysiology and may prove helpful in identifying potential intervention 
targets.

BACKGROUND: Declining ability to independently perform instrumental activities 
of daily living (IADL) is a hallmark of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Financial capacity, an aspect of IADL, includes financial skills such as 
balancing a checkbook and making change and is potentially sensitive to early 
decline in cognitive abilities, raising the question of how financial capacity 
is affected by buildup of cerebral tau and amyloid-hallmarks of AD pathology.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the relationship between cerebral tau, 
amyloid, and their interaction with change in financial capacity over time.
DESIGN: Participants were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) to have at least one yearly follow-up Financial Capacity 
Instrument-Short Form (FCI-SF) exam and a flortaucipir (tau) PET scan within 6 
months of baseline (and in a subset, a florbetapir (amyloid) PET scan within a 
year of baseline).
SETTING: Multi-center international cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sample size was 507-322 cognitively normal (CN) and 185 with 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sixty-two percent (N=316) had amyloid 
data.
MEASUREMENTS: Linear mixed-effects models predicted FCI-SF total score from 
baseline tau, age, gender, premorbid intelligence, executive function, memory, 
and the interaction of each with time. Regions of interest included inferior 
temporal, entorhinal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate, supramarginal, and 
dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF). Additional models examined amyloid and its 
interaction with tau. Results were adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Among the whole sample and in CN participants alone, higher baseline 
tau in all regions, most prominently in the inferior temporal, entorhinal 
cortex, and supramarginal regions, was significantly associated with worse 
performance on the FCI-SF over time. Among MCI participants alone, this 
relationship was significant in the entorhinal cortex (unstandardized b = 0.27, 
t = 3.71, adjusted p = 0.001), inferior temporal (b = 0.27, t = 3.96, p < 
0.001), precuneus (b = 0.27, t = 3.04, p = 0.01), and supramarginal (b = 0.27, t 
= 2.74, p = 0.02) regions. Amyloid alone was significantly associated with worse 
FCI-SF performance in only the whole sample (b = 0.15, t = 2.37, p = 0.04), and 
a three-way interaction between tau, amyloid, and time was only present for 
entorhinal cortex tau in CN individuals (b = -1.61, t = -2.61, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Early tau accumulation is linked to worsening financial capacity 
over time in CN older adults and MCI. Declining financial capacity may signal 
pathological buildup and serve as an early warning sign for AD, and future 
research should continue to investigate the longitudinal relationship between 
tau, financial capacity, and other IADL.

BACKGROUND: Current sequencing technologies have provided for a more 
comprehensive genome-wide assessment and have increased genotyping accuracy of 
rare variants. Scan statistic approaches have previously been adapted to genetic 
sequencing data. Unlike currently-employed association tests, 
scan-statistic-based approaches can both localize clusters of disease-related 
variants and, subsequently, examine the phenotype association within the 
resulting cluster. In this study, we present a novel Quantitative Phenotype Scan 
Statistic (QPSS) that extends an approach for dichotomous phenotypes to 
continuous outcomes in order to identify genomic regions where rare 
quantitative-phenotype-associated variants cluster.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the performance and practicality of QPSS with extensive 
simulations and an application to a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Using QPSS, we identify regions of rare variant enrichment 
associated with levels of AD-related proteins, CSF Aβ1-42 and p-tau181P.
CONCLUSIONS: QPSS is implemented under the assumption that causal variants 
within a window have the same direction of effect. Typical self-contained tests 
employ a null hypothesis of no association between the target variant set and 
the phenotype. Therefore, an advantage of the proposed competitive test is that 
it is possible to refine a known region of interest to localize 
disease-associated clusters. The definition of clusters can be easily adapted 
based on variant function or annotation.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NFL) is a general 
biomarker for axonal damage.
METHODS: This genome-wide association study (GWAS) consisted of 169 mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 94 cognitively normal (CN) subjects from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Analyses of 
associations between CSF NFL and genetic polymorphisms were performed using an 
additive genetic model. The novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
identified by GWAS were further examined for their correlation with other 
AD-related phenotypes at baseline and during follow-up using multiple linear 
regression model and mixed effects model respectively. Survival analysis was 
performed to evaluate the respective risks of progression from CN to prodromal 
AD and from MCI to AD among populations with different genotypes.
RESULTS: Two novel SNPs (rs465401 and rs460420), both near the ADAMTS1 gene on 
chromosome 21, showed genome-wide significant associations with CSF NFL. The 
minor allele (A) of rs465401 was also associated with higher CSF total tau 
(t-tau) levels, lower amyloid-β (Aβ) levels as well as greater longitudinal 
change in both Aβ and t-tau among the CN group. Furthermore, the Cox 
proportional hazards models showed increased risks for prodromal AD among the 
cognitive normal AA homozygotes.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that two SNPs (rs465401 and rs460420) were associated with 
CSF NFL in non-demented elders. The associations identified in this study may 
make the SNPs and ADAMTS1 ideal candidates for future genetic studies on aging 
and neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Growth factor receptor-bound protein-associated binding protein 2 
gene (GAB2) has been regarded as one of the susceptibility gene associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of GAB2 polymorphisms on 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in AD continuum remains unclear.
METHODS: We evaluated the connection between four single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of GAB2 and AD-related CSF biomarkers including amyloid β 
(Aβ), total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) level in 627 Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects.
RESULTS: rs1385600 and rs1007837 were significantly associated with all the 
three biomarkers in CSF (rs1385600: Aβ Pc =0.0112, T-tau Pc =0.0356, P-tau Pc 
=0.0116; rs1007837: Aβ Pc =0.0058, T-tau Pc =0.0278, P-tau Pc =0.0231). 
rs2373115 only showed significant association with Aβ and P-tau (Aβ, Pc=0.0398, 
P-tau, Pc=0.0329). rs10793294 showed no significant association with all the 
three biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that GAB2 variants were significantly 
associated with the level of the three CSF biomarkers, which further supported 
that GAB2 genetic variation modulates AD risk via the alteration of both Aβ and 
tau pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Heterogeneity in downstream atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
predominantly investigated in relation to pathological hallmarks (Aβ, tau) and 
co-pathologies (cerebrovascular burden) independently. However, the proportional 
contribution of each pathology in determining atrophy pattern remains unclear. 
We assessed heterogeneity in atrophy using two recently conceptualized 
dimensions: typicality (typical AD atrophy at the center and deviant atypical 
atrophy on either extreme including limbic predominant to hippocampal sparing 
patterns) and severity (overall neurodegeneration spanning minimal atrophy to 
diffuse typical AD atrophy) in relation to Aβ, tau, and cerebrovascular burden.
METHODS: We included 149 Aβ + individuals on the AD continuum (cognitively 
normal, prodromal AD, AD dementia) and 163 Aβ- cognitively normal individuals 
from the ADNI. We modeled heterogeneity in MRI-based atrophy with 
continuous-scales of typicality (ratio of hippocampus to cortical volume) and 
severity (total gray matter volume). Partial correlation models investigated the 
association of typicality/severity with (a) Aβ (global Aβ PET centiloid), tau 
(global tau PET SUVR), cerebrovascular (total white matter hypointensity volume) 
burden (b) four cognitive domains (memory, executive function, language, 
visuospatial composites). Using multiple regression, we assessed the association 
of each pathological burden and typicality/severity with cognition.
RESULTS: (a) In the AD continuum, typicality (r = -0.31, p < 0.001) and severity 
(r = -0.37, p < 0.001) were associated with tau burden after controlling for Aβ, 
cerebrovascular burden and age. Findings imply greater tau pathology in limbic 
predominant atrophy and diffuse atrophy. (b) Typicality was associated with 
memory (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and language scores (r = 0.19, p = 0.02). Severity 
was associated with memory (r = 0.26, p < 0.001), executive function (r = 0.24, 
p = 0.003) and language scores (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). Findings imply better 
cognitive performance in hippocampal sparing and minimal atrophy patterns. 
Beyond typicality/severity, tau burden but not Aβ and cerebrovascular burden 
explained cognition.
CONCLUSION: In the AD continuum, atrophy-based severity was more strongly 
associated with tau burden than typicality after accounting for Aβ and 
cerebrovascular burden. Cognitive performance in memory, executive function and 
language domains was explained by typicality and/or severity and additionally 
tau pathology. Typicality and severity may differentially reflect burden arising 
from tau pathology but not Aβ or cerebrovascular pathologies which need to be 
accounted for when investigating AD heterogeneity.

INTRODUCTION: Based on previous studies, a preclinical classification for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed. However, 1) specificity of the 
different neuronal injury (NI) biomarkers has not been studied, 2) subjects with 
subtle cognitive impairment but normal NI biomarkers (SCINIB) have not been 
included in the analyses and 3) progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
or dementia of the AD type (DAT), referred to here as MCI/DAT, varies between 
studies. Therefore, we analyzed data from 486 cognitively normal (CN) and 327 
DAT subjects in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1/GO/2 cohorts.
RESULTS: In the ADNI-1 cohort (median follow-up of 6 years), 6.3% and 17.0% of 
the CN subjects developed MCI/DAT after 3 and 5 years follow-up, respectively. 
NI biomarker cutoffs [structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) tau] were established in DAT patients and memory composite scores 
were calculated in CN subjects in a cross-sectional sample (n = 160). In the 
complete longitudinally followed CN ADNI cohort (n = 326, median follow-up of 
2 years), CSF and MRI values predicted an increased conversion to MCI/DAT. 
Different NI biomarkers showed important disagreements for classifying subjects 
as abnormal NI [kappa = (-0.05)-(0.33)] and into AD preclinical groups. SCINIB 
subjects (5.0%) were more prevalent than AD preclinical stage 3 subjects (3.4%) 
and showed a trend for increased progression to MCI/DAT.
CONCLUSIONS: Different NI biomarkers lead to different classifications of ADNI 
subjects, while structural MRI and CSF tau measures showed the strongest 
predictive value for progression to MCI/DAT. The newly defined SCINIB category 
of ADNI subjects is more prevalent than AD preclinical stage individuals.

We developed machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict abnormal tau 
accumulation among patients with prodromal AD. We recruited 64 patients with 
prodromal AD using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset. Supervised ML approaches based on the random forest (RF) and a gradient 
boosting machine (GBM) were used. The GBM resulted in an AUC of 0.61 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.579-0.647) with clinical data (age, sex, years of 
education) and a higher AUC of 0.817 (95% CI 0.804-0.830) with clinical and 
neuropsychological data. The highest AUC was 0.86 (95% CI 0.839-0.885) achieved 
with additional information such as cortical thickness in clinical data and 
neuropsychological results. Through the analysis of the impact order of the 
variables in each ML classifier, cortical thickness of the parietal lobe and 
occipital lobe and neuropsychological tests of memory domain were found to be 
more important features for each classifier. Our ML algorithms predicting tau 
burden may provide important information for the recruitment of participants in 
potential clinical trials of tau targeting therapies.

SimulAD is a computational disease progression model (DPM) originally developed 
on the ADNI database to simulate the evolution of clinical and imaging markers 
characteristic of AD, and to quantify the disease severity (DS) of a subject. In 
this work, we assessed the validity of this estimated DS, as well as the 
generalization of the DPM., by applying SimulAD on a new cohort from the Geneva 
Memory Center (GMC). The differences between the estimated DS of healthy, mild 
cognitive impairment and AD dementia groups were statistically significant 
(p-values < 0.05; d ≥ 0.8). DS correlated with MMSE (ρ = -0.55), hippocampal 
atrophy (ρ = -0.62), glucose hypometabolism (ρ = -0.67), amyloid burden (ρ = 
0.31) and tau deposition (ρ = 0.62) (p-values < 0.01). Based on the dynamics 
estimated on the ADNI cohort, we simulated a DPM for the subjects of the GMC 
cohort. The difference between the temporal evolution of similar biomarkers 
simulated on the ADNI and GMC cohorts remained below 10%. This study illustrates 
the robustness and good generalization of SimulAD, highlighting its potential 
for clinical and pharmaceutical studies.

Most studies evaluating Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers longitudinally have 
studied patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress to AD; data 
on normal subjects are scarce. We studied which biomarkers best predict 
cognitive decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 
(ADAS-Cog) among those with normal cognition at baseline, and derived cut points 
to predict decline. We studied 191 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had normal cognition at baseline, 2 + visits 
(mean follow-up 3.1 years), and data on neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and structural MRI. We used repeated measures linear 
regression of log ADAS-Cog on age, race, gender, education, APOE4 status, 
baseline biomarker values, and follow-up time; an interaction between biomarker 
and time assessed predictive power. Neuropsychological tests did not 
significantly predict ADAS-Cog decline, while both MRI variables and CSF 
biomarkers did; CSF markers were the strongest predictors. Optimal cut points 
for baseline CSF markers to distinguish decliners were < 220 pg/ml (Aβ42), ≥61 
pg/ml (t-tau), ≥21 pg/ml (p-tau), ≥0.31 (t-tau/Aβ42), and ≥0.10 (p-tau/Aβ42). 
For progression to MCI/AD (n = 28), the best markers were t-tau, t-tau/Aβ42, and 
p-tau/Aβ42, with optimal cut points of 58, 0.31, and 0.08, respectively. The 
optimal cut points across all markers and cut points predicted decline in 
ADAS-Cog, as well as transition to MCI, with a 65% accuracy. Our findings 
support current models of AD progression and suggest it is feasible to establish 
biomarker criteria to predict cognitive decline in individuals with normal 
cognition. Larger studies will be needed to more accurately characterize optimal 
cut points.

Recent studies found the variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene PLD3 
were associated with cognitive function, but its detailed mechanism before 
typical AD onset was unknown. Our current study examined the impact of PLD3 
common variant rs11667768 on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total-tau and 
phosphorylated-tau levels and structural MRI from the ADNI database. We found 
rs11667768 was significantly associated with CSF total-tau levels and 
hippocampal volumes at baseline and six-year follow-up in the total non-demented 
elderly group and the mild cognitive impairment subgroup, indicating a potential 
role of PLD3 common variants in influencing cognitive function through changing 
CSF total-tau levels and hippocampal volumes.

BACKGROUND: The relative performance of semi-quantitative amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers in diagnosing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting the cognitive evolution of patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is still debated.
METHODS: Subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 with 
complete baseline cognitive assessment (Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical 
Dementia Rating [CDR] and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale [ADAS-cog] scores), CSF collection (amyloid-β1-42 [Aβ], tau and 
phosphorylated tau) and 18F-florbetapir scans were included in our 
cross-sectional cohort. Among these, patients with MCI or substantial memory 
complaints constituted our longitudinal cohort and were followed for 
30 ± 16 months. PET amyloid deposition was quantified using relative retention 
indices (standardised uptake value ratio [SUVr]) with respect to pontine, 
cerebellar and composite reference regions. Diagnostic and prognostic 
performance based on PET and CSF was evaluated using ROC analysis, multivariate 
linear regression and survival analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: The cross-sectional study included 677 participants and revealed that 
pontine and composite SUVr values were better classifiers (AUC 0.88, diagnostic 
accuracy 85%) than CSF markers (AUC 0.83 and 0.85, accuracy 80% and 75%, for Aβ 
and tau, respectively). SUVr was a strong independent determinant of cognition 
in multivariate regression, whereas Aβ was not; tau was also a determinant, but 
to a lesser degree. Among the 396 patients from the longitudinal study, 82 (21%) 
converted to AD within 22 ± 13 months. Optimal SUVr thresholds to differentiate 
AD converters were quite similar to those of the cross-sectional study. 
Composite SUVr was the best AD classifier (AUC 0.86, sensitivity 88%, 
specificity 81%). In multivariate regression, baseline cognition (CDR and 
ADAS-cog) was the main predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Pontine and 
composite SUVr were moderate but independent predictors of final status and 
CDR/ADAS-cog progression rate, whereas baseline CSF markers had a marginal 
influence. The adjusted HRs for AD conversion were 3.8 (p = 0.01) for PET 
profile, 1.2 (p = ns) for Aβ profile and 1.8 (p = 0.03) for tau profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Semi-quantitative amyloid PET appears more powerful than CSF 
markers for AD grading and MCI prognosis in terms of cognitive decline and AD 
conversion.

BACKGROUND: The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no investigation has focused on 
racial differences in the longitudinal effect of APOE genotypes on CSF amyloid 
beta (Aβ42) and tau levels in AD.
METHODS: This study used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI): 222 participants with AD, 264 with cognitive normal (CN), and 
692 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and two years follow-up. We 
used a linear mixed model to investigate the effect of APOE-ε4-genotypes on 
longitudinal changes in the amyloid beta and tau levels.
RESULTS: Individuals with 1 or 2 APOE ε4 alleles revealed significantly higher 
t-Tau and p-Tau, but lower amyloid beta Aβ42 compared with individuals without 
APOE ε4 alleles. Significantly higher levels of log-t-Tau, log-p-Tau, and low 
levels of log-Aβ42 were observed in the subjects with older age, being female, 
and the two diagnostic groups (AD and MCI). The higher p-Tau and Aβ42 values are 
associated with poor Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performance. 
Non-Hispanic Africa American (AA) and Hispanic participants were associated with 
decreased log-t-Tau levels (β =  - 0.154, p = 0.0112; β =  - 0.207, and 
p = 0.0016, respectively) as compared to those observed in Whites. Furthermore, 
Hispanic participants were associated with a decreased log-p-Tau level 
(β =  - 0.224, p = 0.0023) compared to those observed in Whites. There were no 
differences in Aβ42 level for non-Hispanic AA and Hispanic participants compared 
with White participants.
CONCLUSION: Our study, for the first time, showed that the APOE ε4 allele was 
associated with these biomarkers, however with differing degrees among racial 
groups.

BACKGROUND: An elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an elevated NLR has also been 
implicated in many other conditions that are risk factors for AD, prompting 
investigation into whether the NLR is directly linked with AD pathology or a 
result of underlying comorbidities. Herein, we explored the relationship between 
the NLR and AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) subjects. Adjusting for sociodemographics, APOE4, and common 
comorbidities, we investigated these associations in two cohorts: the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the M.J. de Leon CSF 
repository at NYU. Specifically, we examined associations between the NLR and 
cross-sectional measures of amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), total tau (t-tau), and 
phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau), as well as the trajectories of these CSF measures 
obtained longitudinally.
RESULTS: A total of 111 ADNI and 190 NYU participants classified as CU with 
available NLR, CSF, and covariate data were included. Compared to NYU, ADNI 
participants were older (73.79 vs. 61.53, p < 0.001), had a higher proportion of 
males (49.5% vs. 36.8%, p = 0.042), higher BMIs (27.94 vs. 25.79, p < 0.001), 
higher prevalence of hypertensive history (47.7% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001), and a 
greater percentage of Aβ-positivity (34.2% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.009). In the ADNI 
cohort, we found cross-sectional associations between the NLR and CSF Aβ42 
(β=-12.193, p = 0.021), but not t-tau or p-tau. In the NYU cohort, we found 
cross-sectional associations between the NLR and CSF t-tau (β = 26.812, p = 
0.019) and p-tau (β = 3.441, p = 0.015), but not Aβ42. In the NYU cohort alone, 
subjects classified as Aβ+ (n = 38) displayed a stronger association between the 
NLR and t-tau (β = 100.476, p = 0.037) compared to Aβ- subjects or the 
non-stratified cohort. In both cohorts, the same associations observed in the 
cross-sectional analyses were observed after incorporating longitudinal CSF 
data.
CONCLUSIONS: We report associations between the NLR and Aβ42 in the older ADNI 
cohort, and between the NLR and t-tau and p-tau181 in the younger NYU cohort. 
Associations persisted after adjusting for comorbidities, suggesting a direct 
link between the NLR and AD. However, changes in associations between the NLR 
and specific AD biomarkers may occur as part of immunosenescence.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research has shown that elevated blood 
C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with increased Alzheimer disease (AD) 
risk only in APOE ε4 allele carriers; the objective of this study was to examine 
the interactive effects of plasma CRP and APOE genotype on cognition and AD 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study 
were analyzed, including APOE genotype; plasma CRP concentrations; diagnostic 
status (i.e., mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to AD); Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia Staging 
Instrument scores; CSF concentrations of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42), total tau 
(t-Tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau); and amyloid (AV45) PET imaging. 
Multivariable regression analyses tested the associations between plasma CRP and 
APOE on cognitive and biomarker outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 566 ADNI participants, 274 (48.4%) had no, 222 (39.2%) had 1, and 
70 (12.4%) had 2 APOE ε4 alleles. Among only participants who had 2 APOE ε4 
alleles, elevated CRP was associated with lower MMSE score at baseline (β [95% 
confidence interval] -0.52 [-1.01, -0.12]) and 12-month follow-up (β -1.09 
[-1.88, -0.17]) after adjustment for sex, age, and education. The interaction of 
2 APOE ε4 alleles and elevated plasma CRP was associated with increased CSF 
levels of t-Tau (β = 11.21, SE 3.37, p < 0.001) and p-Tau (β = +2.74, SE 1.14, p 
< 0.01). Among those who had no APOE ε4 alleles, elevated CRP was associated 
with decreased CSF t-Tau and p-Tau. These effects were stronger at the 12-month 
follow-up.
DISCUSSION: CRP released during peripheral inflammation could be a mediator in 
APOE ε4-related AD neurodegeneration and serve as a drug target for AD.

Brain iron accumulation, which is indicated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
ferritin, is associated with the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). 
Studies have indicated that iron deposition might participate in Alzheimer's 
pathology through the induction of microglial activation. A soluble triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTrem2) in CSF is increasingly recognized 
as a reliable indicator for microglia activity in the brain and participates in 
the development of neuroinflammation. However, the association between CSF 
ferritin and sTrem2 under the AD continuum has not been well-established. We 
enrolled individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Participants were classified into healthy controls (HC, n = 46) and AD 
continuum (n = 105) in the combined strata of Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration 
(ATN) mode and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) criteria. The associations between 
CSF ferritin (indicating iron burden) and sTrem2, as well as AD pathology, which 
is reflected by Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau in CSF, were explored. CSF ferritin was 
significantly associated with sTrem2 among all participants (β = 0.517, P < 
0.001, FDR < 0.001), HC (β = 0.749, P = 0.006, FDR = 0.010), and AD continuum (β 
= 0.488, P < 0.001, FDR < 0.001), respectively. However, ferritin predicted the 
accelerated sTrem2 level in those with high ferritin (β = 0.549, P = 0.036, FDR 
= 0.045). In conclusion, CSF ferritin serves as a potential biomarker of 
Trem2-indicated microglia function.

It has been increasingly evident that pulse pressure (PP) is associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) but whether PP increases AD risk and the mechanism 
responsible for this association remains unclear. To investigate the effects of 
PP in the process of AD, we have evaluated the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations of PP with AD biomarkers, brain structure and cognition and have 
assessed the effect of PP on AD risk in a large sample (n= 1,375) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Multiple linear regression 
and mixed-model regression were employed in cross-sectional and longitudinal 
analyses respectively. Clinical disease progression was assessed using Cox 
proportional hazards models. High PP was associated with lower β-amyloid 42 
(Aβ42) (P= .015), and higher total tau (T-tau) (P= .011), phosphorylated tau 
(P-tau) (P= .003), T-tau/Aβ42 (P= .004) and P-tau/Aβ42 (P = .001), as well as 
heavier cortical amyloid-beta burden (P= .011). Longitudinally, baseline high PP 
was significantly associated with hippocampal atrophy (P= .039), entorhinal 
atrophy (P= .031) and worse memory performance (P= .058). Baseline high PP 
showed more rapid progression than those with normal PP (P <.001). These results 
suggest PP elevation could increase AD risk, which may be driven by amyloid 
plaques and subclinical neurodegeneration.

Women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) in terms of 
both disease prevalence and severity. Previous autopsy work has suggested that, 
in the presence of AD neuropathology, females are more susceptible to the 
clinical manifestation of AD. This manuscript extends that work by evaluating 
whether sex alters the established associations between cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarker levels and brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume, cognition). 
Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) and included individuals with normal cognition (n = 348), mild cognitive 
impairment (n = 565), and AD (n = 185). We leveraged mixed effects regression 
models to assess the interaction between sex and baseline cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarker levels of amyloid-β42 (Aβ-42) and total tau on cross-sectional and 
longitudinal brain aging outcomes. We found a significant interaction between 
sex and Aβ-42 on longitudinal hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.002), and longitudinal 
decline in memory (p = 0.017) and executive function (p = 0.025). Similarly, we 
observed an interaction between sex and total tau level on longitudinal 
hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.008), and longitudinal decline in executive function 
(p = 0.034). Women with Aβ-42 and total tau levels indicative of worse 
pathological changes showed more rapid hippocampal atrophy and cognitive 
decline. The sex difference was particularly pronounced among individuals with 
MCI, with lower education, and varied by APOE ε4 allele. These results suggest 
females may be more susceptible to the clinical manifestation of AD.

There is evidence that gray matter networks are disrupted in Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) and associated with cognitive impairment and faster disease 
progression. However, it remains unknown how these alterations are related to 
the presence of Apolipoprotein E isoform E4 (ApoE4), the most prominent genetic 
risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate this topic 
at the individual level, we explore the impact of ApoE4 and the disease 
progression on the Single-Subject Gray Matter Networks (SSGMNets) using the 
graph theory approach. Our data sample comprised 200 MCI patients selected from 
the ADNI database, classified as non-Converters and Converters (will progress 
into AD). Each group included 50 ApoE4-positive ('Carriers', ApoE4 + ) and 50 
ApoE4-negative ('non-Carriers', ApoE4-). The SSGMNets were estimated from 
structural MRIs at two-time points: baseline and conversion. We investigated 
whether altered network topological measures at baseline and their rate of 
change (RoC) between baseline and conversion time points were associated with 
ApoE4 and disease progression. We also explored the correlation of SSGMNets 
attributes with general cognition score (MMSE), memory (ADNI-MEM), and 
CSF-derived biomarkers of AD (Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau). Our results showed that 
ApoE4 and the disease progression modulated the global topological network 
properties independently but not in their RoC. MCI converters showed a lower 
clustering index in several regions associated with neurodegeneration in AD. The 
SSGMNets' topological organization was revealed to be able to predict cognitive 
and memory measures. The findings presented here suggest that SSGMNets could 
indeed be used to identify MCI ApoE4 Carriers with a high risk for AD 
progression.

Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have quantified filamentous 
tau pathology using regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on observations of the 
topographical distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem tissue. 
However, such approaches may not take full advantage of information contained in 
neuroimaging data. The present study employs an unsupervised data-driven method 
to identify spatial patterns of tau-PET distribution, and to compare these 
patterns to previously published "pathology-driven" ROIs. Tau-PET patterns were 
identified from a discovery sample comprised of 123 normal controls and patients 
with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the 
Swedish BioFINDER cohort, who underwent [18 F]AV1451 PET scanning. Associations 
with cognition were tested in a separate sample of 90 individuals from ADNI. 
BioFINDER [18 F]AV1451 images were entered into a robust voxelwise stable 
clustering algorithm, which resulted in five clusters. Mean [18 F]AV1451 uptake 
in the data-driven clusters, and in 35 previously published pathology-driven 
ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18 F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models 
comparing [18 F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to tests of global cognition 
and episodic memory, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Two data-driven ROIs 
consistently demonstrated the strongest or near-strongest effect sizes across 
all cognitive tests. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature 
selection routine resulted in selection of two ROIs (one data-driven, one 
pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 28% of the variance of 
a global cognitive composite score. Our findings suggest that [18 F]AV1451-PET 
data naturally clusters into spatial patterns that are biologically meaningful 
and that may offer advantages as clinical tools.

PURPOSE: To describe results of the Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration (ATN) 
research framework classification in the Argentine-Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (arg-ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 12 dementia 
of Alzheimer's type (DAT), and 14 normal controls were studied following the 
ADNI2 protocol. Patients were categorized according to presence or absence of 
the biomarkers for amyloid beta (Aβ; A: amyloid positron emission tomography 
[PET] scan or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Aβ42), tau (T: CSF phosphorylated-tau), 
and neurodegeneration (N: CSF total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET scan, or 
structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan).
RESULTS: A+T+N+ biomarker profile was identified at baseline in 91% of mild 
dementia patients, 20% of early MCI patients, 46% of late MCI patients, and 14% 
of control subjects. Suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP, A-T-N+) was found 
in 8% of mild dementia, 20% of early MCI, 15% of late MCI, and 7% of control 
subjects. Conversion rates to dementia after 5-year follow-up were 85% in A+T+N+ 
MCI patients and 50% in A-T-N+ patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We present initial 5-year follow-up results of a regional ADNI 
based on AD biomarkers and the ATN classification.

BACKGROUND: Sex-related difference in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been 
proposed, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms have been suggested to be 
involved in the pathogenesis of AD.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ApoE is 
associated with AD biomarkers and whether the associations are different 
(between sexes).
METHODS: Data of 309 participants [92 with normal cognition, 148 with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 69 with AD dementia] from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were cross-sectionally evaluated with the 
multiple linear regression model and longitudinally with the multivariate linear 
mixed-effects model for the associations of CSF ApoE with AD biomarkers. 
Sex-ApoE interaction was used to estimate whether sex moderates the associations 
of CSF ApoE and AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: Significant interactions between CSF ApoE and sex on AD biomarkers were 
observed [amyloid-β (Aβ): p = 0.0169 and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau): p = 
0.0453]. In women, baseline CSF ApoE levels were significantly associated with 
baseline Aβ (p = 0.0135) and total-tau (t-tau) (p < 0.0001) as well as 
longitudinal changes of the biomarkers (Aβ: p = 0.0104; t-tau: p = 0.0110). In 
men, baseline CSF ApoE levels were only correlated with baseline p-tau (p < 
0.0001) and t-tau (p < 0.0001) and did not aggravate AD biomarkers 
longitudinally.
CONCLUSION: The associations between CSF ApoE and AD biomarkers were 
sex-specific. Elevated CSF ApoE was associated with longitudinal changes of AD 
biomarkers in women, which indicates that CSF ApoE might be involved in the 
pathogenesis of AD pathology in a sex-specific way.

INTRODUCTION: The BIN1 rs744373 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a key 
genetic risk locus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with tau pathology. 
Because tau typically accumulates in response to amyloid beta (Aβ), we tested 
whether BIN1 rs744373 accelerates Aβ-related tau accumulation.
METHODS: We included two samples (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
[ADNI], n = 153; Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early 
and Reliably [BioFINDER], n = 63) with longitudinal 18 F-Flortaucipir positron 
emission tomography (PET), Aβ biomarkers, and longitudinal cognitive 
assessments. We assessed whether BIN1 rs744373 was associated with faster 
tau-PET accumulation at a given level of Aβ and whether faster BIN1 
rs744373-associated tau-PET accumulation mediated cognitive decline.
RESULTS: BIN1 rs744373 risk-allele carriers showed faster global tau-PET 
accumulation (ADNI/BioFINDER, P < .001/P < .001). We found significant Aβ by 
rs744373 interactions on global tau-PET change (ADNI: β/standard error 
[SE] = 0.42/0.14, P = 0.002; BioFINDER: β/SE = -0.35/0.15, P = .021), BIN1 
risk-allele carriers showed accelerated tau-PET accumulation at higher Aβ 
levels. In ADNI, rs744373 effects on cognitive decline were mediated by faster 
global tau-PET accumulation (β/SE = 0.20/0.07, P = .005).
DISCUSSION: BIN1-associated AD risk is potentially driven by accelerated tau 
accumulation in the face of Aβ.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether self-reported mild traumatic 
brain injury (mTBI) was associated with decreased AD-vulnerable cortical 
thickness, and to assess the relationship between AD-vulnerable cortical 
thickness and AD-related biomarker in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative subjects. We identified 45 self-reported mTBI subjects, who had 
structural MRI, 18F-AV45 PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data. Of them, eight 
subjects were normal; ten were preclinical AD; seventeen were MCI due to AD; ten 
were AD. Additional demographics-controlled 45 subjects were included. Cortical 
thickness of eight AD-vulnerable regions, mean AD-vulnerable cortical thickness, 
18F-AV45 PET mean amyloid SUVR, CSF Aβ42, CSF total tau (T-tau), and CSF 
phosphorylated tau (P-tau) were compared between mTBI and non-TBI groups. 
Correlational analysis was done to investigate the relationship between mean 
AD-vulnerable cortical thickness and mean amyloid SUVR, CSF Aβ42, CSF T-Tau, CSF 
P-Tau. Our study revealed that preclinical AD subjects with self-reported mTBI 
had smaller cortical thickness in mean and three AD-vulnerable cortical regions 
than non-TBI subjects (P<0.05). The mean AD-vulnerable cortical thickness was 
correlated with CSF T-tau (r=-0.81, P=0.001). There was no statistical 
difference in the comparison of normal, MCI due to AD, and AD groups. Our study 
indicated that among individuals with preclinical AD, but not normal, MCI due to 
AD and AD subjects, self-reported mTBI was associated with more decreased 
AD-vulnerable cortical thickness which was related to CSF tau pathology, 
suggesting the possible early involvement of tau pathology in the decreased 
AD-vulnerable cortical thickness of self-reported TBI subjects.

INTRODUCTION: We sought biological pathways that explained discordance between 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and symptoms.
METHODS: In 306 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1 
participants across the AD clinical spectrum, we investigated association 
between cognitive outcomes and 23 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes associated 
with abnormalities in the AD biomarkers amyloid β1-42 and total-tau. In a 
200-person "training" set, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator 
regression estimated model weights for the 23 proteins, and for the AD 
biomarkers themselves, as predictors of ADAS-Cog11 scores. In the remaining 106 
participants ("validation" set), fully adjusted regression models then tested 
the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-derived models and a related 
protein marker summary score as predictors of ADAS-Cog11, ADNI diagnostic 
category, and longitudinal cognitive trajectory.
RESULTS: AD biomarkers alone explained 26% of the variance in validation set 
cognitive scores. Surprisingly, the 23 AD-related proteins explained 31% of this 
variance. The biomarkers and protein markers appeared independent in this 
respect, jointly explaining 42% of test score variance. The composite protein 
marker score also predicted ADNI diagnosis and subsequent cognitive trajectory. 
Cognitive outcome prediction redounded principally to ten markers related to 
lipid or vascular functions or to microglial activation or chemotaxis. In each 
analysis, apoE protein and four markers in the latter immune-activation group 
portended better outcomes.
DISCUSSION: CSF markers of vascular, lipid-metabolic and immune-related 
functions may explain much of the disjunction between AD biomarker abnormality 
and symptom severity. In particular, our results suggest the hypothesis that 
innate immune activation improves cognitive outcomes in persons with AD 
pathology. This hypothesis should be tested by further study of cognitive 
outcomes related to CSF markers of innate immune activation.

The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive 
decline is an important topic in the aging research field. Recent studies 
suggest that memory deficits are more susceptible to phosphorylated tau (Ptau) 
than amyloid-beta. However, little is known regarding the neurocognitive 
mechanisms linking Ptau and memory-related decline. Here, we extracted data from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ptau collected at baseline, diffusion tensor imaging 
measure twice, 2 year apart, and longitudinal memory data over 5 years. We 
defined three age- and education-matched groups: Ptau negative cognitively 
unimpaired, Ptau positive cognitively unimpaired, and Ptau positive individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment. We found the presence of CSF Ptau at baseline 
was related to a loss of structural stability in medial temporal lobe 
connectivity in a way that matched proposed disease progression, and this loss 
of stability in connections known to be important for memory moderated the 
relationship between Ptau accumulation and memory decline.

AIMS: To investigate whether insula network connectivity modulates the 
relationship between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype, cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers (Aβ, Tau, and pTau) and cognition across Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) spectrum.
METHODS: Forty-six cognitive normal (CN), 35 subjective memory complaint (SMC), 
41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 32 AD subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were obtained. Multivariable linear 
regression analyses were conducted to investigate the main effects and 
interaction of the APOE genotype and disease status on the insula functional 
connectivity (IFC) network. Mediation and moderation analysis were performed to 
investigate whether IFC strengths regulate the association between APOE 
genotype, CSF biomarkers and cognition. Additionally, the support vector machine 
(SVM) model integrating APOE genotype, CSF biomarkers, and neuroimaging 
biomarkers (insula volumes and altered regional IFCs) was used to classify the 
AD spectrum.
RESULTS: The interactive effect of the APOE genotype and disease on the insula 
network was found in the left medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.L), right 
anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC.R), and bilateral thalamus (THA.B). The 
functional connectivities (FCs) in the left insula (LIns) connecting with the 
left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG.L), SFGmed.L, and right lingual gyrus 
(LING.R) were correlated with cognition. LIns-SFGmed.L and LIns-pMTG.L FCs could 
moderate the effects of Tau on cognition. Furthermore, LIns-SFGmed.L FC may 
suppress the association between APOE genotype and cognition. More importantly, 
the integrated biomarkers from the SVM model yielded strong powers for 
classifying the AD spectrum.
CONCLUSIONS: Insula functional connectivity regulated the association between 
APOE genotype, CSF Tau and cognition and provided stage-dependent biomarkers for 
early differentiation of the AD spectrum. The present study used a 
cross-sectional design. Follow-up studies are needed to validate the 
relationship.

This paper for the 20th anniversary of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) provides an overview of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in ADNI using a dedicated high-resolution 
T2-weighted sequence. A review of the work that supported the inclusion of this 
imaging modality into ADNI Phase 3 is followed by a brief description of the 
ADNI MTL imaging and analysis protocols and a summary of studies that have used 
these data. This review is supplemented by a new study that uses novel 
surface-based tools to characterize MTL neurodegeneration across 
biomarker-defined AD stages. This analysis reveals a pattern of spreading 
cortical thinning associated with increasing levels of tau pathology in the 
presence of elevated amyloid beta, with apparent epicenters in the 
transentorhinal region and inferior hippocampal subfields. The paper concludes 
with an outlook for high-resolution imaging of the MTL in ADNI Phase 4. 
HIGHLIGHTS: As of Phase 3, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol includes a high-resolution 
T2-weighted MRI scan optimized for imaging hippocampal subfields and medial 
temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. These scans are processed by the ADNI core to 
obtain automatic segmentations of MTL subregions and to derive morphologic 
measurements. More detailed granular examination of MTL neurodegeneration in 
response to disease progression is achieved by applying surface-based modeling 
techniques. Surface-based analysis of gray matter loss in MTL subregions reveals 
increasing and spatially expanding patterns of neurodegeneration with advancing 
stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as defined based on amyloid and tau positron 
emission tomography biomarkers in accordance with recently proposed criteria. 
These patterns closely align with post mortem literature on spread of 
pathological tau in AD, supporting the role of tau pathology in the presence of 
elevated levels of amyloid beta as the driver of neurodegeneration.

INTRODUCTION: There is a pressing need for non-invasive, cost-effective tools 
for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 
Cox proportional models were conducted to develop a multimodal hazard score 
(MHS) combining age, a polygenic hazard score (PHS), brain atrophy, and memory 
to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Power 
calculations estimated required clinical trial sample sizes after hypothetical 
enrichment using the MHS. Cox regression determined predicted age of onset for 
AD pathology from the PHS.
RESULTS: The MHS predicted conversion from MCI to dementia (hazard ratio for 
80th versus 20th percentile: 27.03). Models suggest that application of the MHS 
could reduce clinical trial sample sizes by 67%. The PHS alone predicted age of 
onset of amyloid and tau.
DISCUSSION: The MHS may improve early detection of AD for use in memory clinics 
or for clinical trial enrichment.
HIGHLIGHTS: A multimodal hazard score (MHS) combined age, genetics, brain 
atrophy, and memory. The MHS predicted time to conversion from mild cognitive 
impairment to dementia. MHS reduced hypothetical Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
clinical trial sample sizes by 67%. A polygenic hazard score predicted age of 
onset of AD neuropathology.

Multiple biomarkers can capture different facets of Alzheimer's disease. 
However, statistical models of biomarkers to predict outcomes in Alzheimer's 
rarely model nonlinear interactions between these measures. Here, we used 
Gaussian Processes to address this, modelling nonlinear interactions to predict 
progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's over 3 years, 
using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Measures 
included: demographics, APOE4 genotype, CSF (amyloid-β42, total tau, 
phosphorylated tau), [18F ]florbetapir, hippocampal volume and brain-age. We 
examined: (a) the independent value of each biomarker; and (b) whether modelling 
nonlinear interactions between biomarkers improved predictions. Each measured 
added complementary information when predicting conversion to Alzheimer's. A 
linear model classifying stable from progressive MCI explained over half the 
variance (R2 = 0.51, p < .001); the strongest independently contributing 
biomarker was hippocampal volume (R2 = 0.13). When comparing sensitivity of 
different models to progressive MCI (independent biomarker models, additive 
models, nonlinear interaction models), we observed a significant improvement 
(p < .001) for various two-way interaction models. The best performing model 
included an interaction between amyloid-β-PET and P-tau, while accounting for 
hippocampal volume (sensitivity = 0.77, AUC = 0.826). Closely related biomarkers 
contributed uniquely to predict conversion to Alzheimer's. Nonlinear biomarker 
interactions were also implicated, and results showed that although for some 
patients adding additional biomarkers may add little value (i.e., when 
hippocampal volume is high), for others (i.e., with low hippocampal volume) 
further invasive and expensive examination may be warranted. Our framework 
enables visualisation of these interactions, in individual patient biomarker 
'space', providing information for personalised or stratified healthcare or 
clinical trial design.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays 
an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be 
detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm 
with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the 
pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of 
clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the 
brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD 
neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant 
information on AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify blood DNAm associated 
with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological biomarkers for AD. Our study 
included matched samples of whole blood DNA methylation, CSF Aβ42, 
phosphorylated tau181 (pTau181), and total tau (tTau) biomarkers data, measured 
on the same subjects and at the same clinical visits from a total of 202 
subjects (123 CN or cognitively normal, 79 AD) in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. To validate our findings, we also 
examined the association between premortem blood DNAm and postmortem brain 
neuropathology measured on a group of 69 subjects in the London dataset.
RESULTS: We identified a number of novel associations between blood DNAm and CSF 
biomarkers, demonstrating that changes in pathological processes in the CSF are 
reflected in the blood epigenome. Overall, the CSF biomarker-associated DNAm is 
relatively distinct in CN and AD subjects, highlighting the importance of 
analyzing omics data measured on cognitively normal subjects (which includes 
preclinical AD subjects) to identify diagnostic biomarkers, and considering 
disease stages in the development and testing of AD treatment strategies. 
Moreover, our analysis revealed biological processes associated with early brain 
impairment relevant to AD are marked by DNAm in the blood, and blood DNAm at 
several CpGs in the DMR on HOXA5 gene are associated with pTau181 in the CSF, as 
well as tau-pathology and DNAm in the brain, nominating DNAm at this locus as a 
promising candidate AD biomarker.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a valuable resource for future mechanistic and 
biomarker studies of DNAm in AD.

Background: rs9357347 located at the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 
cells (TREM) gene cluster could increase TREM2 and TREM-like transcript 1 
(TREML1) brain gene expression, which is considered to play a protective role 
against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objectives: To investigate the role of 
rs9357347 in AD pathogenesis by exploring the effects of rs9357347 on AD 
specific biomarkers. Methods: This study analyzed the association of rs9357347 
with AD-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers from 201 
cognitively normal (CN) older adults, 349 elders with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and 172 elders with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). We next analyzed the association in 259 amyloid-β positive 
(Aβ+) elders and 117 amyloid-β negative (Aβ-) elders (Aβ+: CSF Aβ1-42 ≤ 192 
pg/ml; Aβ-: CSF Aβ1-42 > 192 pg/ml). Associations were tested using multiple 
linear regression models at baseline. Furthermore, multiple mixed-effects models 
were used in a longitudinal study which lasted 4 years. Results: At baseline, we 
found that rs9357347 had association with CSF Aβ1-42 in CN group (β = 0.357, P = 
0.009). In AD group, rs9357347 was associated with total tau (T-tau) level (β = 
-0.436, P = 0.007). Moreover, the strong influence exerted by rs9357347 on T-tau 
was also seen in Aβ+ group (β = -0.202, P = 0.036). In the longitudinal study, 
rs9357347 was also found to be associated with Aβ1-42 in CN group (β = 0.329, P 
= 0.023). In AD group, the mutation of rs9357347 was associated with slower 
accumulation of T-tau (β = -0.472, P = 0.002) and tau phosphorylated at 
threonine 181 [P-tau 181 (β = -0.330, P = 0.019)]. Furthermore, the obvious 
influence exerted by rs9357347 on T-tau was also seen in Aβ+ group (β = -0.241, 
P = 0.013). Conclusion: This study suggested that rs9357347 reduced the risk of 
AD by modulating both amyloid-β pathology and neuronal degeneration.

INTRODUCTION: This study assessed apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status 
effects on Alzheimer's disease imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
in cognitively normal older adults with significant memory concerns (SMC).
METHODS: Cognitively normal, SMC, and early mild cognitive impairment 
participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were divided by 
APOE ε4 carrier status. Diagnostic and APOE effects were evaluated with emphasis 
on SMC. Additional analyses in SMC evaluated the effect of the interaction 
between APOE and [(18)F]Florbetapir amyloid positivity on CSF biomarkers.
RESULTS: SMC ε4+ showed greater amyloid deposition than SMC ε4-, but no 
hypometabolism or medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. SMC ε4+ showed lower 
amyloid beta 1-42 and higher tau/p-tau than ε4-, which was most abnormal in APOE 
ε4+ and cerebral amyloid positive SMC.
DISCUSSION: SMC APOE ε4+ show abnormal changes in amyloid and tau biomarkers, 
but no hypometabolism or MTL neurodegeneration, reflecting the at-risk nature of 
the SMC group and the importance of APOE in mediating this risk.

Cigarette smoking is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
but the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. In this study, we aimed to 
examine the effects of cigarette smoking on multiple AD biomarkers among older 
individuals with normal cognition (NC). Among 415 older individuals with NC from 
the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, we examined the 
associations between smoking status (non-smokers vs smokers) and global 
cognition, verbal memory, hippocampal volumes, cerebral glucose metabolism and 
CSF AD pathologies. The primary findings of this study were: (1) In NC, smokers 
showed worse performance on verbal memory tests [Rey Auditory Verbal Learning 
Test (RAVLT) total learning score and delayed recall] than non-smokers; (2) 
Compared with non-smokers, smokers had significantly lower HpVR; (3) Smokers, 
relative to non-smokers, demonstrated lower levels of cerebral glucose 
metabolism as measured by FDG-PET; and (4) there were no significant differences 
in CSF AD pathologies (CSF Aβ42, t-tau or p-tau) between non-smokers and 
smokers. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the relationship between 
cigarettes smoking and changes in AD-related markers over time. Further, ADNI 
participants were highly educated and predominantly white. This may limit the 
generalizability of our results. In summary, among individuals with NC, 
cigarette smoking was associated with memory impairment, hippocampal atrophy and 
cerebral glucose hypometabolism, but not CSF AD pathologies.

Intraindividual variability (IIV) across neuropsychological measures within a 
single testing session is a promising marker predictive of cognitive decline and 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that greater 
IIV is cross-sectionally associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), but 
not with cortical thickness or brain volume, in older adults without dementia 
who were amyloid beta (Aβ) positive. However, there is little known about the 
association between change in IIV and CBF over time. Therefore, we examined 
12-month longitudinal change in IIV and interactions of IIV and AD biomarker 
status on changes in regional CBF. Fifty-three non-demented Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants underwent lumbar puncture to obtain 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline and neuropsychological testing and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams at baseline and 12-month follow-up 
evaluation. IIV was calculated as the intraindividual standard deviation across 
6 demographically-corrected neuropsychological measures. Pulsed arterial spin 
labeling (ASL) MRI was acquired to quantify CBF and FreeSurfer-derived a priori 
CBF regions of interest (ROIs) were examined. AD biomarker positivity was 
determined using a published CSF p-tau/Aβ ratio cut-score. Change scores were 
calculated for IIV, CBF, and mean neuropsychological performance from baseline 
to 12 months. Hierarchical linear regression models showed that after adjusting 
for age and gender, there was a significant interaction between IIV change and 
biomarker-positivity (p-tau/Aβ+) for change in entorhinal and hippocampal CBF 
but not for the other ROIs. Specifically, increases in IIV were associated with 
reductions in entorhinal and hippocampal CBF among individuals who were 
biomarker-positive (n = 21). In contrast, there were no significant associations 
between change in IIV and CBF among those who were biomarker-negative (n = 32). 
Findings remained similar when analyses were performed adjusting for change in 
mean level of neuropsychological performance. Changes in IIV may be sensitive to 
changes in regional hypoperfusion in AD-vulnerable regions among AD 
biomarker-positive individuals, above and beyond demographics and mean 
neuropsychological performance. These findings provide further evidence 
supporting IIV as a potential marker of cerebrovascular brain changes in 
individuals at risk for dementia.

BACKGROUND: Models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology posit that 
amyloidosis [A] precedes and accelerates tau pathology [T] that leads to 
neurodegeneration [N]. Besides this A-T-N sequence, other biomarker sequences 
are possible. This current work investigates and compares the longitudinal 
trajectories of Alzheimer's ATN biomarker profiles in non-demented elderly 
adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: Based on the ATN classification system, 262 individuals were identified 
before dementia diagnosis and accompanied by baseline and follow-up data of ATN 
biomarkers (CSF Aβ42, p-tau, and FDG-PET). We recorded the conversion processes 
in ATN biomarkers during follow-up, then analyzed the possible longitudinal 
trajectories and estimated the conversion rate and temporal evolution of 
biomarker changes. To evaluate how biomarkers changed over time, we used linear 
mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: During a 6-120-month follow-up period, there were four patterns of 
longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's ATN biomarker profiles, from all negative to 
positive through the course of the disease. The most common pattern is that A 
pathology biomarker first emerges. As well as the classical A-T-N sequence, 
other "A-first," "T-first," and "N-first" biomarker pathways were found. The 
N-A-T sequence had the fastest rate of pathological progression (mean 
65.00 months), followed by A-T-N (mean 67.07 months), T-A-N (mean 68.85 months), 
and A-N-T sequences (mean 98.14 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Our current work presents a comprehensive analysis of longitudinal 
trajectories of Alzheimer's ATN biomarkers in non-demented elderly adults. 
Stratifying disease into subtypes depending on the temporal evolution of 
biomarkers will benefit the early recognition and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two 
proteinopathies, amyloid and tau, which have a cascading effect on the 
functional and structural organization of the brain.
METHODS: In this study, we used a supervised machine learning technique to build 
a model of functional connections that predicts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
p-tau/Aβ42 (the PATH-fc model). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) data from 289 older adults in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were utilized for this model.
RESULTS: We successfully derived the PATH-fc model to predict the ratio of 
p-tau/Aβ42 as well as cognitive functioning in older adults across the spectrum 
of healthy and pathological aging. However, the in-sample fit magnitude was low, 
indicating a need for further model development.
DISCUSSION: Our pathology-based model of functional connectivity included 
representation from multiple canonical networks of the brain with intra-network 
connectivity associated with low pathology and inter-network connectivity 
associated with higher levels of pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Whole-brain functional connectivity model (PATH-fc) is linked to AD 
pathophysiology. The PATH-fc model predicts performance in multiple domains of 
cognitive functioning. The PATH-fc model is a distributed model including 
representation from all canonical networks.

BACKGROUND: Autopsy series commonly report a high percentage of coincident 
pathologies in demented patients, including patients with a clinical diagnosis 
of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). However many clinical and biomarker 
studies report cases with a single neurodegenerative disease. We examined 
multimodal biomarker correlates of the consecutive series of the first 22 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative autopsies. Clinical data, 
neuropsychological measures, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, total and phosphorylated 
tau and α-synuclein and MRI and FDG-PET scans.
RESULTS: Clinical diagnosis was either probable DAT or Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-type mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at last evaluation prior to death. All 
patients had a pathological diagnosis of AD, but only four had pure AD. A 
coincident pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), medial 
temporal lobe pathology (TDP-43 proteinopathy, argyrophilic grain disease and 
hippocampal sclerosis), referred to collectively here as MTL, and vascular 
pathology were present in 45.5%, 40.0% and 22.7% of these patients, 
respectively. Hallucinations were a strong predictor of coincident DLB (100% 
specificity) and a more severe dysexecutive profile was also a useful predictor 
of coincident DLB (80.0% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity). Occipital FDG-PET 
hypometabolism accurately classified coincident DLB (80% sensitivity and 100% 
specificity). Subjects with coincident MTL showed lower hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers can be used to independently predict coincident AD and 
DLB pathology, a common finding in amnestic MCI and DAT patients. Cohorts with 
comprehensive neuropathological assessments and multimodal biomarkers are needed 
to characterize independent predictors for the different neuropathological 
substrates of cognitive impairment.

IMPORTANCE: Tau accumulation in Alzheimer disease (AD) is closely associated 
with cognitive impairment. Quantitating tau accumulation by positron emission 
tomography (PET) will be a useful outcome measure for future clinical trials in 
the AD spectrum.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of β-amyloid (Aβ) on PET with 
subsequent tau accumulation on PET in persons who were cognitively unimpaired 
(CU) to gain insight into temporal associations between Aβ and tau accumulation 
and inform clinical trial design.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included individuals aged 
65 to 85 years who were CU and had participated in the Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging, with serial cognitive assessments, serial magnetic resonance imaging, 
11C-Pittsburgh compound B (Aβ) PET scans, and 18F-flortaucipir PET scans, 
collected from May 2015 to March 2020. Persons were excluded if they lacked 
follow-up PET scans. A similarly evaluated CU group from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were also studied. These data were collected from 
September 2015 to March 2020.
EXPOSURES: Participants were stratified by index Aβ levels on PET into low Aβ 
(≤8 centiloid [CL]), subthreshold Aβ (9-21 CL), suprathreshold Aβ (22-67 CL), 
and high Aβ (≥68 CL).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes over a mean of 2.7 (range, 1.1-4.1) years in 
flortaucipir PET in entorhinal, inferior temporal, and lateral parietal regions 
of interest and an AD meta-region of interest (ROI).
RESULTS: A total of 167 people were included (mean age, 74 [range, 65-85] years; 
75 women [44.9%]); 101 individuals were excluded lacking follow-up, and 114 
individuals from the ADNI were also studied (mean [SD] age, 74.14 [5.29] years; 
64 women [56.1%]). In the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, longitudinal flortaucipir 
accumulation rates in the high Aβ group were greater than the suprathreshold, 
subthreshold, and low Aβ groups in the entorhinal ROI (suprathreshold, 0.025 
[95% CI, 0.013-0.037] standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] units; 
subthreshold, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.014-0.037] SUVR units; low Aβ, 0.034 [95% CI, 
0.02-0.049] SUVR units), inferior temporal ROI (suprathreshold, 0.025 [95% CI, 
0.014-0.035] SUVR units; subthreshold, 0.027 [95% CI, 0.017-0.037] SUVR units; 
low Aβ, 0.035 [95% CI, 0.022-0.047] SUVR units), and the AD meta-ROI 
(suprathreshold, 0.023 [95% CI, 0.013-0.032] SUVR units; subthreshold, 0.025 
[95% CI, 0.016-0.034] SUVR units; low Aβ, 0.032 [95% CI, 0.021-0.043] SUVR 
units) (all P < .001). Flortaucipir accumulation rates in the subthreshold and 
suprathreshold Aβ groups in temporal regions were nonsignificantly elevated 
compared with the low Aβ group. In the ADNI cohort, the variance was larger than 
in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging but point estimates for annualized 
flortaucipir accumulation in the inferior temporal ROI were very similar. An 
estimated 216 participants who were CU per group with PET Aβ of 68 CL or more 
would be needed to detect a 25% annualized reduction in flortaucipir 
accumulation rate in the AD meta-ROI with 80% power.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Substantial flortaucipir accumulation in temporal 
regions is greatest in persons aged 65 to 85 years who were CU and had high 
initial Aβ PET levels, compared with those with lower Aβ levels. Recruiting 
persons who were CU and exhibiting Aβ of 68 CL or more on an index Aβ PET is a 
feasible strategy to recruit for clinical trials in which a change in tau PET 
signal is an outcome measure.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are closely 
associated with Tau proteins accumulation. In this study, we aimed to implement 
radiomics analysis to discover high-order features from pathological biomarker 
and improve the classification accuracy based on Tau PET images. Two 
cross-racial independent cohorts from the ADNI database (121 AD patients, 197 
MCI patients and 211 normal control (NC) subjects) and Huashan hospital (44 AD 
patients, 33 MCI patients and 36 NC subjects) were enrolled. The radiomics 
features of Tau PET imaging of AD related brain regions were computed for 
classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model. The radiomics model 
was trained and validated in the ADNI cohort and tested in the Huashan hospital 
cohort. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) and clinical scores model were 
also performed to compared with radiomics analysis. Additionally, we explored 
the possibility of using Tau PET radiomics features as a good biomarker to make 
binary identification of Tau-negative MCI versus Tau-positive MCI or 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 carrier versus ApoE ε4 non-carrier. We found that the 
radiomics model demonstrated best classification performance in differentiating 
AD/MCI patients and NC in comparison to SUVR and clinical scores models, with an 
accuracy of 84.8 ± 4.5%, 73.1 ± 3.6% in the ANDI cohort. Moreover, the radiomics 
model also demonstrated greater performance in diagnosing AD than other methods 
in the Huashan hospital cohort, with an accuracy of 81.9 ± 6.1%. In addition, 
the radiomics model also showed the satisfactory classification performance in 
the MCI-tau subgroup experiment (72.3 ± 3.5%, 71.9 ± 3.6% and 63.7 ± 5.9%) and 
in the MCI-ApoE subgroup experiment (73.5 ± 4.3%, 70.1 ± 3.9% and 62.5 ± 5.4%). 
In conclusion, our study showed that based on Tau PET radiomics analysis has the 
potential to guide and facilitate clinical diagnosis, further providing evidence 
for identifying the risk factors in MCI patients.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular dysfunction confers risk for functional decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the clinical interplay of these two pathogenic 
processes is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: We utilized Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data 
to examine associations between peripherally derived soluble cell adhesion 
molecules (CAMs) and clinical diagnostic indicators of AD.
METHODS: Using generalized linear regression models, we examined cross-sectional 
relationships of soluble plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-Selectin to baseline diagnosis 
and functional impairment (clinical dementia rating sum-of-boxes, CDR-SB) in the 
ADNI cohort (n = 112 AD, n = 396 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 58 
cognitively normal). We further analyzed associations of these biomarkers with 
brain-based AD biomarkers in a subset with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
data (n = 351). p-values derived from main effects and interaction terms from 
the linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between independent 
and dependent variables for significance (significance level was set at 0.05 a 
priori for all analysis).
RESULTS: Higher mean VCAM-1 (p = 0.0026) and ICAM-1 (p = 0.0189) levels were 
found in AD versus MCI groups; however, not in MCI versus cognitively normal 
groups. Only VCAM-1 was linked with CDR-SB scores (p = 0.0157), and APOE ɛ4 
genotype modified this effect. We observed independent, additive associations 
when VCAM-1 and CSF amyloid-β (Aβ42), total tau, phosphorylated tau (P-tau), or 
P-tau/Aβ42 (all < p = 0.01) were combined in a CDR-SB model; ICAM-1 showed a 
similar pattern, but to a lesser extent.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate independent associations of plasma-based 
vascular biomarkers and CSF biomarkers with AD-related clinical impairment.

Recent advances in biomarker studies compiled from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are summarized here. CSF Aβ42, total tau, and 
phosphorylated tau181 are the most sensitive biomarkers for diagnosing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting the onset of AD in cases with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Many perspective studies on PiB-PET, 
FDG-PET, MRI volumetry, and some neuropsychiatric tests have provided evidence 
for the usefulness of these biomarkers for diagnosing AD and MCI due to AD. 
Basic and clinical studies have contributed considerably to the establishment of 
clinical evidence that supports the usefulness of these markers. Given the 
progress in the diagnosis of preclinical AD, discovery of therapy that is 
essential for the cure of AD is expected soon.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers represent several neurodegenerative 
processes, such as synaptic dysfunction, neuronal inflammation and injury, as 
well as amyloid pathology. We performed an exome-wide rare variant analysis of 
six AD biomarkers (β-amyloid, total/phosphorylated tau, NfL, YKL-40, and 
Neurogranin) to discover genes associated with these markers. Genetic and 
biomarker information was available for 480 participants from two studies: 
EMIF-AD and ADNI. We applied a principal component (PC) analysis to derive 
biomarkers combinations, which represent statistically independent biological 
processes. We then tested whether rare variants in 9576 protein-coding genes 
associate with these PCs using a Meta-SKAT test. We also tested whether the PCs 
are intermediary to gene effects on AD symptoms with a SMUT test. One PC loaded 
on NfL and YKL-40, indicators of neuronal injury and inflammation. Four genes 
were associated with this PC: IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3, and SLC22A10. Mediation tests 
suggest, that these genes also affect dementia symptoms via inflammation/injury. 
We also observed an association between a PC loading on Neurogranin, a marker 
for synaptic functioning, with GABBR2 and CASZ1, but no mediation effects. The 
results suggest that rare variants in IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3, and SLC22A10 heighten 
susceptibility to neuronal injury and inflammation, potentially by altering 
cytoskeleton structure and immune activity disinhibition, resulting in an 
elevated dementia risk. GABBR2 and CASZ1 were associated with synaptic 
functioning, but mediation analyses suggest that the effect of these two genes 
on synaptic functioning is not consequential for AD development.

INTRODUCTION: Rs9296559 within CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) has been 
identified as a susceptibility locus for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent 
studies indicated that CD2AP functioned as a regulator of endocytic trafficking 
to modulate the β-amyloid (Aβ) generation in neurons. Moreover, knockdown of 
cindr, the Drosophila ortholog of CD2AP, enhanced tau-induced neurodegeneration, 
implying CD2AP also participated in tau pathology. However, the role of 
rs9296559 in regulating Aβ and tau metabolism in AD was still unclear.
METHODS: Here, the associations of rs9296559 with CSF Aβ1-42, p-tau, and t-tau 
were performed using a linear regression model in a total of 543 cognitive 
normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD subjects from the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The results were 
replicated in an independent cohort consisting of 198 Chinese subjects recruited 
from our hospital.
RESULTS: In the ADNI cohort, CC + TC genotypes significantly increased CSF t-tau 
and p-tau levels in MCI patients but did not alter CSF tau levels in AD. This 
association was also observed in the replication cohort. Moreover, there was no 
association between rs9296559 and CSF Aβ1-42 level at different disease statuses 
in the two cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that rs9296559 was associated with higher CSF 
t-tau and p-tau levels in MCI, supporting that CD2AP modified AD risk by 
altering tau-related neurodegeneration in the early stage of the AD continuum. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the 
association between CD2AP genotypes and AD CSF biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD) clinical trials enroll patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) meeting biomarker criteria, but specific 
enrollment criteria vary among trials.
METHODS: We used data from AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MCI participants to 
assess AD biomarker eligibility, variation in trial outcome measures, and 
statistical power.
RESULTS: Most (65%) participants meet eligibility criteria based on low 
cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta (Aβ). Relative to trials enrolling exclusively 
based on low cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, trials including participants with a high 
ratio of phosphorylated tau to Aβ would include an additional 15% of 
participants. Fewer (34% to 62%) participants met criteria for Aβ and tau. 
Differences in clinical and demographic characteristics of modeled trial samples 
were minimal. Those with low Aβ and high tau showed the greatest change over 
time on outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Eligibility rates for prodromal trials vary depending on the 
specific biomarker criteria, though differences in demographics and the 
variation associated with outcome measures are minimal. Broadening inclusion 
criteria beyond amyloid alone may facilitate recruitment but include patients 
showing slower progression over time. Biomarker criteria selection should be 
informed by the goal of enrolling individuals most likely to utilize and benefit 
from the intervention under investigation in a particular setting.

To test whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) 
concentration is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and its 
associations with other hallmarks of AD, we examined the CSF GAP-43 measurements 
of 787 participants (245 cognitively normal (CN), 415 individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and 127 individuals with AD dementia) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Associations were 
investigated between CSF GAP-43 and clinical diagnosis, Aβ/tau/neurodegeneration 
(AT(N)) status, CSF and blood biomarkers of AD, cognitive measurements and brain 
neuroimaging findings. CSF GAP-43 levels were increased in patients with AD 
dementia (mean, 6331.05 pg/ml) compared with the CN (mean, 5001.05 pg/ml) and 
MCI (mean, 5118.8 pg/ml) (P < 0.001) groups. CSF GAP-43 correlated with CSF 
phosphorylated tau 181(p-tau) (r = 0.768, P < 0.001), and had high diagnostic 
accuracy in differentiating tau positive status vs. tau negative status (area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.8606). CSF GAP-43 was 
particularly elevated among individuals with tau positive status. High CSF 
GAP-43 was associated with longitudinal deterioration of cognitive scores and 
brain neuroimaging findings. CSF GAP-43 was associated with a clinical diagnosis 
of AD dementia and with an individual's tau status, cognitive measurements and 
findings from neuroimaging. This study implies that CSF GAP-43 as a biomarker of 
synaptic dysfunction could predict the disease progression of AD patients.

IMPORTANCE: Early detection of brain amyloidosis (Aβ+) is pivotal for diagnosing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and optimizing patient management, especially in light 
of emerging treatments. While plasma biomarkers are promising, their combined 
diagnostic value through specific ratios remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of plasma pTau isoform (pTau181 
and pTau217) to Aβ42 ratios in detecting Aβ+ status.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 423 participants from the 
multicenter prospective ALZAN cohort, recruited for cognitive complaints. Aβ+ 
status was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Validation of 
the key findings was performed in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort, where Aβ+ status was determined using PET imaging.
EXPOSURES: Plasma biomarkers (pTau181, pTau217, Aβ40, Aβ42) were measured using 
immunoassays and mass spectrometry, with specific ratios calculated. In the 
ALZAN cohort, the impact of confounding factors such as age, renal function, 
ApoE4 status, body mass index, and the delay between blood collection and 
processing was also evaluated to assess their influence on biomarker 
concentrations and diagnostic performance.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance 
of plasma biomarkers and their ratios for detecting Aβ+ status. Secondary 
outcomes included the proportion of patients classified as low, intermediate, or 
high risk for Aβ+ using a two-cutoff approach.
RESULTS: The pTau181/Aβ42 ratio matched the diagnostic performance of pTau217 
with AUC of 0.911 (0.880-0.936). The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated the highest 
diagnostic accuracy in the ALZAN cohort, with an AUC of 0.927 (0.898-0.950), 
outperforming individual biomarkers. Both ratios effectively mitigated 
confounding factors, such as variations in renal function, and were particularly 
excellent in identifying Aβ+ status in individuals with early cognitive decline. 
Validation in the ADNI cohort confirmed these findings, with consistent 
performance across different measurement methods. The two-cutoff workflow using 
pTau217/Aβ42 reduced the intermediate-risk zone from 16% to 8%, enhancing 
stratification for clinical decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio offers superior diagnostic 
accuracy for detecting Aβ+ compared to individual biomarkers and reduces 
diagnostic uncertainty. These findings highlight the clinical utility of plasma 
biomarker ratios for early AD detection, paving the way for broader 
implementation in clinical and research settings.

INTRODUCTION: Genetic associations for endophenotypes of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) in cognitive stages preceding AD have not been thoroughly evaluated.
METHODS: We conducted genome-wide association studies for AD-related 
endophenotypes including hippocampal volume, logical memory scores, and 
cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and total/phosphorylated tau in cognitively normal 
(CN), mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study.
RESULTS: In CN subjects, study-wide significant (P < 8.3 × 10-9) loci were 
identified for total tau near SRRM4 and C14orf79 and for hippocampal volume near 
MTUS1. In mild cognitive impairment subjects, study-wide significant association 
was found with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near ZNF804B for logical 
memory test of delayed recall scores. We found consistent expression patterns of 
C14orf40 and MTUS1 in carriers with risk alleles of expression SNPs and in 
brains of AD patients, compared with in the noncarriers and in brains of 
controls.
DISCUSSION: Our findings for AD-related brain changes before AD provide insight 
about early AD-related biological processes.

Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) biology and progression are not yet 
fully characterized. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of sex on 
cognitive progression in subjects with high likelihood of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's and followed up to 10 years in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cerebrospinal fluid 
total-tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ42) ratio values were used to sub-classify 559 MCI 
subjects (216 females, 343 males) as having "high" or "low" likelihood for MCI 
due to Alzheimer's. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models incorporating 
all follow-ups. The worsening from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive score (mean, SD) (9 ± 12) in subjects with high likelihood of 
MCI due to Alzheimer's was markedly greater than that in subjects with low 
likelihood (1 ± 6, p < 0.0001). Among MCI due to AD subjects, the mean worsening 
in cognitive score was significantly greater in females (11.58 ± 14) than in 
males (6.87 ± 11, p = 0.006). Our findings highlight the need to further 
investigate these findings in other populations and develop sex specific 
timelines for Alzheimer's disease progression.

OBJECTIVE: To examine neuroanatomical changes associated with depressive 
symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the relationship between brain 
structure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in depressed and 
non-depressed patients.
METHODS: Two independent cohorts were used in this study. The first cohort (KI) 
was collected from the Memory Clinic at Karolinska University Hospital and 
consisted of 41 AD patients. The second cohort was selected and downloaded from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI) and consisted of 
148 patient. Patients underwent medical, neuropsychological assessment, 
laboratory analyses of CSF, including β amyloid 1-42 (Aβ 42), total τ (t-τ), 
phosphorylated τ 181 (p-τ) and brain MRI examination. In the KI cohort, 
depression was assessed using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, and 
in the ADNI cohort the Geriatric Depression Scale was applied. 3D T1-weighted 
MRI images were processed using automated steps for segmentation and surface 
reconstruction implemented in Freesurfer. General linear model analysis was used 
as a statistical approach.
RESULTS: Cortical thinning in AD patients with depressive symptoms compared with 
those without was observed in the left parietal and temporal brain regions in 
both cohorts. Negative correlation between cortical thickness and t-τ was 
greater in depressed compared with non-depressed AD patients in precuneus and 
parahippocampal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms in AD patients are 
associated with cortical thinning in temporal and parietal regions. In addition, 
our findings suggest that τ protein pathology in these areas may contribute to 
the development of depressive symptoms in AD.

The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is the most important genetic risk 
factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms 
responsible for it remain controversial. We used the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to examine the influence of APOE ε4 dose 
on clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers across the AD spectrum (from cognitive 
normal to AD patients with severe cognitive impairment). A total of 1718 
participants from the ADNI cohort were selected, and we evaluated the impact of 
ε4 dose on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels' Abeta1-42 (Aβ1-42), tau, and 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau); cortical amyloid deposition (Florbetapir-PET-AV45); 
brain atrophy (MRI); brain metabolism (FDG-PET); hippocampal metabolism; and 
cognitive declines, through different cognitive subgroups. We found that (1) ε4 
was associated with decreased CSF beta-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and increased cerebral 
Aβ deposition across the AD spectrum; (2) increased CSF tau, P-tau and cerebral 
hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, and cognition decline were all associated 
with APOE ε4 in prodromal AD stage; (3) increased CSF tau, P-tau and cerebral 
hypometabolism appear to begin earlier than hippocampal atrophy and cognitive 
decline. We hypothesized that APOE ε4 increases cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) 
deposition in all the stages of AD development, and also influences Aβ-initiated 
cascade of downstream neurodegenerative effects, thereby increasing the risk of 
AD.

OBJECTIVE: New diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been developed using biomarkers aiming to 
establish whether the clinical syndrome is likely due to underlying AD. We 
investigated the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting progression from amnesic MCI to dementia, 
testing the hypotheses that (1) markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration provide 
distinct and complementary prognostic information over different time intervals, 
and that (2) evidence of neurodegeneration in amyloid-negative MCI individuals 
would be useful prognostically.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the ADNI-1 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative Phase 1) database on all individuals with a baseline diagnosis of 
MCI, baseline MRI and CSF data, and at least one follow-up visit. MRI data were 
processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a 
measure known as the ``AD signature,'' as well as hippocampal volume. The CSF 
biomarkers amyloid-β, total tau, and phospho tau were also examined. We 
performed logistic regression analyses to identify the best baseline biomarker 
predictors of progression to dementia over 1 or 3 years, and Cox regression 
models to test the utility of these markers for predicting time-to-dementia.
RESULTS: For prediction of dementia in MCI, the AD signature cortical thickness 
biomarker performed better than hippocampal volume. Although CSF tau measures 
were better than CSF amyloid-β at predicting dementia within 1 year, the AD 
signature was better than all CSF measures at prediction over this relatively 
short-term interval. CSF amyloid-β was superior to tau and AD signature at 
predicting dementia over 3 years. When CSF amyloid-β was dichotomized using 
previously published cutoff values and treated as a categorical variable, a 
multivariate stepwise Cox regression model indicated that both the AD signature 
MRI marker and the categorical CSF amyloid-β marker were useful in predicting 
time-to-event diagnosis of AD dementia.
CONCLUSION: In amnesic MCI, short-term (1 year) prognosis of progression to 
dementia relates strongly to baseline markers of neurodegeneration, with the AD 
signature MRI biomarker of cortical thickness performing the best among MRI and 
CSF markers studied here. Longer-term (3 year) prognosis in these individuals 
was better predicted by a marker indicative of brain amyloid. Prediction of 
time-to-event in a survival model was predicted by the combination of these 
biomarkers. These results provide further support for emerging models of the 
temporal relationship of pathophysiologic events in AD and demonstrate the 
utility of these biomarkers at the prodromal stage of the illness.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation algorithms make it 
possible to study detailed medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures as 
hippocampal subfields and amygdala subnuclei, offering opportunities to develop 
biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We identified the MTL substructures significantly associated with 
tau-positron emission tomography (PET) signal in 581 non-demented individuals 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3). We confirmed our 
results in our UCLouvain cohort including 110 non-demented individuals by 
comparing volumes between individuals with different visual Braak's stages and 
clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Four amygdala subnuclei (cortical, central, medial, and accessory 
basal) were associated with tau in amyloid beta-positive (Aβ+) clinically normal 
(CN) individuals, while the global amygdala and hippocampal volumes were not. 
Using UCLouvain data, we observed that both Braak I-II and Aβ+ CN individuals 
had smaller volumes in these subnuclei, while no significant difference was 
observed in the global structure volumes or other subfields.
CONCLUSION: Measuring specific amygdala subnuclei, early atrophy may serve as a 
marker of temporal tauopathy in preclinical AD, identifying individuals at risk 
of progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amygdala atrophy is not homogeneous in preclinical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Tau pathology is associated with atrophy of specific amygdala 
subnuclei, specifically, the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal 
subnuclei. Hippocampal and amygdala volume is not associated with tau in 
preclinical AD. Hippocampus and CA1-3 volume is reduced in preclinical AD, 
regardless of tau.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers (ARBs) 
may be protective against dementia, and studies in transgenic animals indicate 
that this may be due to improved amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether taking ARBs was associated with an 
attenuation of age-related increases in cerebral Aβ retention, and reduced 
progression to dementia.
METHODS: Eight hundred seventy-one stroke-free and dementia-free older adults 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study underwent 
baseline lumbar puncture, and a subgroup (n = 124) underwent 12 and 24 month 
follow-up lumbar puncture. Participants were followed at variable intervals for 
clinical progression to dementia. Linear mixed models and ANCOVA compared ARBs 
users with those taking other antihypertensives (O-antiHTN) or no 
antihypertensives (No-antiHTN) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ and 
phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels. Cox regression and chi-square analyses 
compared groups on progression to dementia.
RESULTS: ARBs users exhibited greater vascular risk and lower educational 
attainment than the No-antiHTN group. Longitudinal analyses indicated higher CSF 
Aβ and lower P-tau in ARBs users versus other groups. Cross-sectional analyses 
revealed age-related decreases in CSF Aβ in other groups but not ARBs users. 
ARBs users were less likely to progress to dementia and showed reduced rate of 
progression relative to the No-antiHTN group.
DISCUSSION: Patients taking ARBs showed an attenuation of age-related decreases 
in CSF Aβ, a finding that is consistent with studies done in transgenic animals. 
These findings may partly explain why ARBs users show reduced progression to 
dementia despite their lower educational attainment and greater vascular risk 
burden.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) more 
accurately predict progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are more strongly 
associated with AD biomarkers and neuroimaging profiles than ADNI criteria. 
However, research to date has been conducted in relatively healthy samples with 
few comorbidities. Given that history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for AD and common in 
Veterans, we compared neuropsychological, typical (Petersen/Winblad), and ADNI 
criteria for MCI in Vietnam-era Veterans with histories of TBI or PTSD.
METHOD: 267 Veterans (mean age = 69.8) from the DOD-ADNI study were evaluated 
for MCI using neuropsychological, typical, and ADNI criteria. Linear regressions 
adjusting for age and education assessed associations between MCI status and AD 
biomarker levels (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] p-tau181, t-tau, and Aβ42) by 
diagnostic criteria. Logistic regressions adjusting for age and education 
assessed the effects of TBI severity and PTSD symptom severity simultaneously on 
MCI classification by each criteria.
RESULTS: Agreement between criteria was poor. Neuropsychological criteria 
identified more Veterans with MCI than typical or ADNI criteria, and were 
associated with higher CSF p-tau181 and t-tau. Typical and ADNI criteria were 
not associated with CSF biomarkers. PTSD symptom severity predicted MCI 
diagnosis by neuropsychological and ADNI criteria. History of moderate/severe 
TBI predicted MCI by typical and ADNI criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: MCI diagnosis using sensitive neuropsychological criteria is more 
strongly associated with AD biomarkers than conventional diagnostic methods. MCI 
diagnostics in Veterans would benefit from incorporation of comprehensive 
neuropsychological methods and consideration of the impact of PTSD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and stroke risk factors independently 
predict cognitive impairment, likely through independent disease pathways. 
However, limited work has sought to describe the dynamic interplay between these 
important risk factors. This article evaluated the interaction between stroke 
risk and AD biomarkers on hippocampal volume and cognitive performance. We first 
evaluated the interaction between stroke risk factors and AD biomarkers using 
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 1202). We 
then extended our findings to an independent autopsy data set from the National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 1122) using measures of AD pathology. 
Stroke risk was quantified using the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile. In ADNI, 
stroke risk interacted with tau and amyloid levels in relation to baseline and 
longitudinal cognitive performance. Similarly, in NACC, stroke risk interacted 
with amyloid and tau positivity on cognitive performance. The effect of stroke 
risk factors on cognition was strongest in the absence of AD biomarkers or 
neuropathology, providing additional evidence that AD biomarkers and stroke risk 
factors relate to cognition through independent pathways.

INTRODUCTION: Factors responsible for the deposition of pathological tau in the 
brain are incompletely understood. This study links macroscale tau deposition in 
the human brain to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics using resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).
METHODS: Low-frequency (< 0.1 Hz) resting-state global brain activity is coupled 
with CSF flow and potentially reflects CSF dynamics-related clearance. We 
examined the correlation between rsfMRI measures of CSF inflow and global 
activity (gBOLD-CSF coupling) as a predictor, interacting with amyloid beta 
(Aβ), of tau and cortical thickness (dependent variables) across Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants from cognitively unimpaired 
through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
RESULTS: Tau deposition in Aβ+ participants, accompanied by cortical thinning 
and cognitive decline, is associated with decreased gBOLD-CSF coupling. Tau 
mediates the relationship between coupling and thickness.
DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that resting-state global brain activity and CSF 
movements comodulate Alzheimer's tau deposition, presumably related to CSF 
clearance.
HIGHLIGHTS: A non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
assessment of a CSF clearance-related process is carried out. Global brain 
activity is coupled with CSF inflow in human fMRI during resting state. Global 
fMRI-CSF coupling is correlated with tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
coupling measure is also associated with cortical thickness, mediated by tau.

In Alzheimer's diseases (AD), tau pathology is strongly associated with 
cognitive decline. Preclinical evidence suggests that tau spreads across 
connected neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Supporting this, 
cross-sectional AD studies show that tau deposition patterns resemble functional 
brain networks. However, whether higher functional connectivity is associated 
with higher rates of tau accumulation is unclear. Here, we combine resting-state 
fMRI with longitudinal tau-PET in two independent samples including 53 (ADNI) 
and 41 (BioFINDER) amyloid-biomarker defined AD subjects and 28 (ADNI) vs. 16 
(BioFINDER) amyloid-negative healthy controls. In both samples, AD subjects show 
faster tau accumulation than controls. Second, in AD, higher fMRI-assessed 
connectivity between 400 regions of interest (ROIs) is associated with 
correlated tau-PET accumulation in corresponding ROIs. Third, we show that a 
model including baseline connectivity and tau-PET is associated with future 
tau-PET accumulation. Together, connectivity is associated with tau spread in 
AD, supporting the view of transneuronal tau propagation.

PURPOSE: Left-right asymmetry, an important feature of brain development, has 
been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, although it's less discussed in 
typical Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to investigate whether asymmetric 
tau deposition plays a potential role in AD heterogeneity.
METHODS: Two independent cohorts consisting of patients with mild cognitive 
impairment due to AD and AD dementia with tau PET imaging were enrolled [the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort with 18F-Flortaucipir, 
the Shanghai Memory Study (SMS) cohort with 18F-Florzolotau]. Based on the 
absolute global tau interhemispheric differences, each cohort was divided into 
two groups (asymmetric versus symmetric tau distribution). The two groups were 
cross-sectionally compared in terms of demographic, cognitive characteristics, 
and pathological burden. The cognitive decline trajectories were analyzed 
longitudinally.
RESULTS: Fourteen (23.3%) and 42 (48.3%) patients in the ADNI and SMS cohorts 
showed an asymmetric tau distribution, respectively. An asymmetric tau 
distribution was associated with an earlier age at disease onset (proportion of 
early-onset AD: ADNI/SMS/combined cohorts, p = 0.093/0.026/0.001) and more 
severe pathological burden (i.e., global tau burden: ADNI/SMS cohorts, 
p < 0.001/= 0.007). And patients with an asymmetric tau distribution were 
characterized by a steeper cognitive decline longitudinally (i.e., the annual 
decline of Mini-Mental Status Examination score: ADNI/SMS/combined cohorts, 
p = 0.053 / 0.035 / < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetry in tau deposition, which may be associated with an 
earlier age at onset, more severe pathological burden, and a steeper cognitive

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of Ab and tau, Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) 
imaging and hippocampal atrophy are promising Alzheimer's disease biomarkers yet 
the associations between them are not known. We applied a validated, automated 
hippocampal labeling method and 3D radial distance mapping to the 1.5T 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 388 ADNI subjects with 
baseline CSF Ab(42), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau(181)) and 
98 subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using PIB. We used 
linear regression to investigate associations between hippocampal atrophy and 
average cortical, parietal and precuneal PIB standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR) and CSF Ab(42), t-tau, p-tau(181), t-tau/Ab(42) and p-tau(181)/Ab(42). 
All CSF measures showed significant associations with hippocampal volume and 
radial distance in the pooled sample. Strongest correlations were seen for 
p-tau(181), followed by p-tau(181)/Ab(42) ratio, t-tau/Ab(42) ratio, t-tau and 
Ab(42). p-tau(181) showed stronger correlation in ApoE4 carriers, while t-tau 
showed stronger correlation in ApoE4 noncarriers. Of the 3 PIB measures the 
precuneal SUVR showed strongest associations with hippocampal atrophy.

BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α) signaling pathway plays a 
significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the 
relationship between TNF-α related inflammatory proteins and pathological 
markers of AD, and examine their possibility as a predictor of the conversion of 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.
METHODS: This study included both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. The 
levels of TNF-α related inflammatory proteins, Aβ1-42, total-tau(t-tau), 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed in 
healthy controls (HC, n = 90), MCI (n = 116), and AD participants (n = 75) from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Kaplan-Meier analyses 
were used to evaluate the predictive value of the examined putative AD markers 
after follow-up visits.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional cohort, we observed higher CSF levels of TNF-α 
related inflammatory proteins in the MCI and AD patients with positive tau 
pathology. TNF receptors (TNFR) were more closely associated with t-tau and 
p-tau than Aβ1-42, in HC, MCI and AD subjects. In the longitudinal cohort with a 
mean follow-up of 30.2 months, MCI patients with high levels of CSF TNFR1 
(p = 0.001) and low levels of TNFR2 (p < 0.001) were more likely to develop into 
AD.
CONCLUSION: TNFR-signaling might be involved in the early pathogenesis of AD and 
TNF receptors may serve as potential predictive biomarkers for MCI.

OBJECTIVE: Both low and high body mass index (BMI) has been associated with 
cognitive impairment and dementia risk, including Alzheimer disease (AD). We 
examined the relationship of BMI with potential underlying biological substrates 
for cognitive impairment.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from participants enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with PET imaging using 
Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB, n = 101) or CSF analyses (n = 405) for β-amyloid 
peptide (Aβ) and total tau. We assessed the relationship of CSF biomarkers and 
global PiB uptake with BMI using linear regression controlling for age and sex. 
We also assessed BMI differences between those who were and were not considered 
biomarker positive. Finally, we assessed BMI change over 2 years in relationship 
to AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: No dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD groups were not 
different in age, education, or BMI. In the overall sample, CSF Aβ (β = 0.181, p 
< 0.001), tau (β = -0.179, p < 0.001), tau/Aβ ratio (β = -0.180, p < 0.001), and 
global PiB uptake (β = -0.272, p = 0.005) were associated with BMI, with markers 
of increased AD burden associated with lower BMI. Fewer overweight individuals 
had biomarker levels indicative of pathophysiology (p < 0.01). These 
relationships were strongest in the MCI and no dementia groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence and burden of in vivo biomarkers of cerebral amyloid 
and tau are associated with lower BMI in cognitively normal and MCI individuals. 
This supports previous findings of systemic change in the earliest phases of the 
disease. Further, MCI in those who are overweight may be more likely to result 
from heterogeneous pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: The association between omega-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and cognition, brain 
imaging and biomarkers is still not fully established.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyze the cross-sectional and retrospective 
longitudinal associations between erythrocyte ω-3 index and cognition, brain 
imaging, and biomarkers among older adults.
METHODS: A total of 832 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI-3) 
participants, with a mean (SD) age of 74.0 (7.9) y, 50.8% female, 55.9% 
cognitively normal, 32.7% with mild cognitive impairment, and 11.4% with 
Alzheimer disease (AD) were included. A low ω-3 index (%EPA + %DHA) was defined 
as the lowest quartile (≤3.70%). Cognitive tests [composite score, AD Assessment 
Scale Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Trail Making Test, 
Category Fluency, Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment] 
and brain variables [hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), 
positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau] were considered as 
outcomes in regression models.
RESULTS: Low ω-3 index was not associated with cognition, hippocampal, and WMH 
volume or brain Aβ and tau after adjustment for demographics, ApoEε4, 
cardiovascular disease, BMI, and total intracranial volume in the 
cross-sectional analysis. In the retrospective analysis, low ω-3 index was 
associated with greater Aβ accumulation (adjusted β = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03; 
P = 0.003). The composite cognitive score did not differ between groups; 
however, low ω-3 index was significantly associated with greater WMS-delayed 
recall cognitive decline (adjusted β = -1.18; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.19; P = 0.019), 
but unexpectedly lower total ADAS-Cog cognitive decline. Low ω-3 index was 
cross-sectionally associated with lower WMS performance (adjusted β = -1.81, 
SE = 0.73, P = 0.014) and higher tau accumulation among ApoE ε4 carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinally, low ω-3 index was associated with greater Aβ 
accumulation and WMS cognitive decline but unexpectedly with lower total 
ADAS-Cog cognitive decline. Although no associations were cross-sectionally 
found in the whole population, low ω-3 index was associated with lower WMS 
cognition and higher tau accumulation among ApoE ε4 carriers. The Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as 
NCT00106899.

INTRODUCTION: The bridging integrator 1(BIN1) rs744373 risk polymorphism has 
been linked to increased [18F]AV1451 signal in non-demented older adults (ie., 
mild cognitive impairment [MCI] plus cognitively normal [CN] individuals). 
However, the association of BIN1 with in vivo tau, amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, and 
cognitive impairment in the asymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
remains unknown.
METHODS: The BIN1 effect on [18F]AV1451 binding was evaluated in 59 cognitively 
normal (CN) participants (39% apolipoprotein E [APOE ε4]) from the Flemish 
Prevent AD Cohort KU Leuven (F-PACK), as well as in 66 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) CN participants, using voxelwise and regional 
statistics. For comparison, 52 MCI patients from ADNI were also studied.
RESULTS: Forty-four percent of F-PACK participants were BIN1 rs744373 
risk-allele carriers, 21% showed high amyloid burden, and 8% had elevated 
[18F]AV1451 binding. In ADNI, 53% and 50% of CNs and MCIs, respectively, carried 
the BIN1 rs744373 risk-allele. Amyloid positivity was present in 23% of CNs and 
51% of MCIs, whereas 2% of CNs and 35% of MCIs showed elevated [18F]AV1451 
binding. There was no significant effect of BIN1 on voxelwise or regional 
[18F]AV1451 in F-PACK or ADNI CNs, or in the pooled CN sample. No significant 
association between BIN1 and [18F]AV1451 was obtained in ADNI MCI patients. 
However, in the MCI group, numerically higher [18F]AV1451 binding was observed 
in the BIN1 risk-allele group compared to the BIN1 normal group in regions 
corresponding to more progressed tau pathology.
DISCUSSION: We could not confirm the association between BIN1 rs744373 
risk-allele and elevated [18F]AV1451 signal in CN older adults or MCI. 
Numerically higher [18F]AV1451 binding was observed, however, in the MCI BIN1 
risk-allele group, indicating that the previously reported positive effect may 
be confounded by group. Therefore, when studying how the BIN1 risk polymorphism 
influences AD pathogenesis, a distinction should be made between asymptomatic, 
MCI, and dementia stages of AD.

Background Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays 
an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be 
detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm 
with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the 
pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of 
clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the 
brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD 
neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant 
information on AD pathogenesis. Methods We performed a comprehensive analysis to 
identify blood DNAm associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological 
biomarkers for AD. Our study included matched samples of whole blood DNA 
methylation, CSF Aβ 42 , phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau 181 ), and total tau 
(tTau) biomarkers data, measured on the same subjects and at the same clinical 
visits from a total of 202 subjects (123 CN or cognitively normal, 79 AD) in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. To validate our 
findings, we also examined the association between premortem blood DNAm and 
postmortem brain neuropathology measured on a group of 69 subjects in the London 
dataset. Results We identified a number of novel associations between blood DNAm 
and CSF biomarkers, demonstrating that changes in pathological processes in the 
CSF are reflected in the blood epigenome. Overall, the CSF biomarker-associated 
DNAm is relatively distinct in CN and AD subjects, highlighting the importance 
of analyzing omics data measured on cognitively normal subjects (which includes 
preclinical AD subjects) to identify diagnostic biomarkers, and considering 
disease stages in the development and testing of AD treatment strategies. 
Moreover, our analysis revealed biological processes associated with early brain 
impairment relevant to AD are marked by DNAm in the blood, and blood DNAm at 
several CpGs in the DMR on HOXA5 gene are associated with pTau 181 in the CSF, 
as well as tau-pathology and DNAm in the brain, nominating DNAm at this locus as 
a promising candidate AD biomarker. Conclusions Our study provides a valuable 
resource for future mechanistic and biomarker studies of DNAm in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary 
tangles. The recent approval of anti-amyloid therapeutic medications highlights 
the crucial need for early detection of Aβ pathological abnormalities in 
individuals without dementia to facilitate timely intervention and treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to identify cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers strongly associated with Aβ pathological positivity in a 
non-demented cohort and evaluate their clinical values.
METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 51 CSF proteins (excluding 
Aβ42, pTau, and Tau) obtained from 474 non-demented participants sourced from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. By utilizing 
the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, we 
identified potential proteins indicative of Aβ pathological positivity and 
evaluated their performance in tracking longitudinal pathological progression.
RESULTS: Our LASSO analysis unveiled three candidates: apolipoprotein E (APOE), 
chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding 
protein 1 (SMOC1). While SMOC1 did not correlate with Aβ42-related cognitive 
alterations, it displayed better abilities in discriminating both CSF-Aβ 
positivity and Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) positivity than the other 
two candidates. It could precisely predict longitudinal Aβ-PET status 
conversion. Notably, SMOC1 was the only protein showing associations with 
longitudinal Aβ-PET trajectory and enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of Aβ42. 
The assessment of combined Aβ42 and SMOC1 yielded valuable clinical insights.
CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidated SMOC1 as a potential biomarker for detecting 
Aβ abnormalities. Aβ42 combining SMOC1 offered critical implications in AD 
pathological diagnosis and management.

The abnormal deposition of amyloid-β protein in the brain plays an important 
role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), being considered a potential clinical 
biomarker. To investigate genetic associations with amyloid-β we used biomarker 
data and genome-wide variants from individuals with AD and mild cognitive 
impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
We used a standard linear model and retested the associations with a mixed 
linear model to correct the residual sample structure. Both methods' results 
showed two identical significant SNPs associated with the A β-42 levels in CSF 
(rs2075650 at intron region TOMM40 with p-value ≥ 1 × 10-16 and rs439401 in the 
intergenic region of LOC100129500 and APOC1 with p-value ≥ 1 × 10-9) and 
highlighted APOC1 and TOMM40, which are well-known genes previously associated 
with AD. Extending our analysis, we considered possible candidate genes mapped 
to SNPs with p-value ≥ 1 × 10-6 to explore gene-set enrichment e gene-gene 
network analysis, which reveals genes related to synaptic transmission, 
transmission of nerve impulses, cell-cell signaling and neurological processes. 
These genes require fine mapping and replication studies to allow more detailed 
understanding of how they may contribute to the genetic architecture of AD.

OBJECTIVE: Disease-related metabolic brain patterns have been verified for a 
variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
study aimed to explore and validate the pattern derived from cognitively normal 
controls (NCs) in the Alzheimer's continuum.
METHODS: This study was based on two cohorts; one from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the other from the Sino Longitudinal Study on 
Cognitive Decline (SILCODE). Each subject underwent [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]florbetapir-PET imaging. 
Participants were binary-grouped based on β-amyloid (Aβ) status, and the 
positivity was defined as Aβ+. Voxel-based scaled subprofile model/principal 
component analysis (SSM/PCA) was used to generate the "at-risk AD-related 
metabolic pattern (ARADRP)" for NCs. The pattern expression score was obtained 
and compared between the groups, and receiver operating characteristic curves 
were drawn. Notably, we conducted cross-validation to verify the robustness and 
correlation analyses to explore the relationships between the score and 
AD-related pathological biomarkers.
RESULTS: Forty-eight Aβ+ NCs and 48 Aβ- NCs were included in the ADNI cohort, 
and 25 Aβ+ NCs and 30 Aβ- NCs were included in the SILCODE cohort. The ARADRPs 
were identified from the combined cohorts and the two separate cohorts, 
characterized by relatively lower regional loadings in the posterior parts of 
the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and regions of the temporal gyrus, as well 
as relatively higher values in the superior/middle frontal gyrus and other 
areas. Patterns identified from the two separate cohorts showed some regional 
differences, including the temporal gyrus, basal ganglia regions, anterior parts 
of the precuneus, and middle cingulate. Cross-validation suggested that the 
pattern expression score was significantly higher in the Aβ+ group of both 
cohorts (p < 0.01), and contributed to the diagnosis of Aβ+ NCs (with area under 
the curve values of 0.696-0.815). The correlation analysis revealed that the 
score was related to tau pathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid (p-tau: 
p < 0.02; t-tau: p < 0.03), but not Aβ pathology assessed with 
[18F]florbetapir-PET (p > 0.23).
CONCLUSIONS: ARADRP exists for NCs, and the acquired pattern expression score 
shows a certain ability to discriminate Aβ+ NCs from Aβ- NCs. The SSM/PCA method 
is expected to be helpful in the ultra-early diagnosis of AD in clinical 
practice.

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) has been considered as a promising modifiable 
risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Nonetheless, it is still 
unclear whether age-related hearing loss associates with neurodegenerative 
biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants with ARHL were selected 
from the established Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. In multivariable models, the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations of ARHL with CSF β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau measurements, brain Aβ 
load, and cortical structural measures were explored. ARHL was associated with 
higher CSF levels of tau (p < 0.001) or ptau181 (p < 0.05) at baseline as well 
as faster elevation rates of these two types of biomarkers (p < 0.05). Although 
the baseline volume/thickness of hippocampus (p < 0.05) and entorhinal cortex (p 
< 0.0005) were higher in individuals with ARHL, these two regions (p < 0.01 for 
hippocampus, p < 0.05 for entorhinal cortex) displayed significantly accelerated 
atrophy in individuals with ARHL. No association of ARHL with CSF or brain Aβ 
levels was found. Subgroup analyses indicated that the above effects of ARHL 
were more significant in non-demented stage. Age-related hearing loss was 
associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid tau levels and atrophy of 
entorhinal cortex.

Educational attainment is widely accepted as a cognitive reserve variable. 
However, few studies have demonstrated that education statistically moderates 
the effects of pathology on cognition. Here, we explored this issue in a sample 
of 441 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment participants from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort who had AD markers (Aβ42, 
tau, structural brain volumes) at baseline and underwent cognitive testing at 
baseline and at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month time points. An AD-related 
biomarker (atrophy/pathology) composite at baseline was developed using stepwise 
backward linear regression. Potential moderation effects of education on the 
relationship between AD biomarkers and cognition were explored using linear 
mixed models. Education was positively correlated with cognition, and biomarkers 
were negatively correlated with cognition, across domains and diagnostic groups. 
However, education generally did not moderate the effects of biomarkers on 
baseline or longitudinal cognition. Our results do not support the hypothesis 
that education protects cognitive function from brain pathology in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, questioning its accepted 
status as a reserve variable.

INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests a connection between vulnerability to 
infections and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The nectin cell adhesion molecule 2 
(NECTIN2) gene coding for a membrane component of adherens junctions is involved 
in response to infection, and its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6859 
was significantly associated with AD risk in several human cohorts. It is 
unclear, however, how exactly rs6859 influences the development of AD pathology. 
The aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (pTau) is a key pathological 
feature of neurodegeneration in AD, which may be induced by infections, among 
other factors, and potentially influenced by genes involved in both AD and 
vulnerability to infections, such as NECTIN2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a causal mediation analysis (CMA) on a 
sample of 708 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). The relationship between rs6859 and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with AD 
(yes/no) as the outcome and pTau-181 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
acting as a mediator in this association, was assessed. Adjusted estimates from 
the probit and linear regression models were used in the CMA model, where an 
additive model considered an increase in dosage of the rs6859 A allele (AD risk 
factor).
RESULTS: The increase in dose of allele A of the SNP rs6859 resulted in about 
0.144 increase per standard deviation (SD) of pTau-181 (95% CI: 0.041, 0.248, 
p<0.01). When included together in the probit model, the change in A allele dose 
and each standard deviation change in pTau-181 predicted 6.84% and 9.79% higher 
probabilities for AD, respectively. In the CMA, the proportion of the average 
mediated effect was 17.05% and was higher for the risk allele homozygotes (AA), 
at 19.40% (95% CI: 6.20%, 43.00%, p<0.01). The sensitivity analysis confirmed 
the evidence of a robust mediation effect.
CONCLUSION: This study reported a new causal relationship between pTau-181 and 
AD. We found that the association between rs6859 in the NECTIN2 gene and AD is 
partly mediated by pTau-181 levels in CSF. The rest of this association may be 
mediated by other factors. Further research, using other biomarkers, is needed 
to uncover the remaining mechanisms of the association between the NECTIN2 gene 
and AD.

BACKGROUND: Recently, genetic variants of the neuronal sortilin-related receptor 
with A-type repeats (SORL1, also called LR11 or sorLA) have emerged as risk 
factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: In this study, SORL1 gene polymorphisms, which have been shown to be 
related to AD, were analyzed for associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ(1-42)), phosphorylated tau181, and total tau levels in a 
non-Hispanic Caucasian sample, which encompassed 100 cognitively healthy elderly 
individuals, 166 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 87 patients with 
probable AD. The data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). Moreover, the impact of 
gene-gene interactions between SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, the major genetic risk factor for 
sporadic AD, on Aβ(1-42) concentrations was investigated.
RESULTS: Significant associations between CSF Aβ(1-42) levels and the SORL1 SNPs 
23 (rs3824968) and 24 (rs2282649) were detected in the AD group. The latter 
association became marginally statistically insignificant after Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons. Carriers of the SORL1 SNP24 T allele and 
the SNP23 A allele both had lower CSF Aβ(1-42) concentrations than non-carriers 
of these alleles. The analysis of the impact of interactions between APOE ε4 
allele and SORL1 SNPs on CSF Aβ(1-42) levels unraveled significant influences of 
APOE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further support for the notion that SORL1 
genetic variants are related to AD pathology, probably by regulating the amyloid 
cascade.

A potential role for ABI3 gene has been suggested in the risk of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), but the detailed mechanism before typical AD onset was unclear. In 
this study, we investigated the associations of ABI3 common variants with 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognitive function scores among non-demented 
elderly from the ADNI database. We found that, in the progressive mild cognitive 
impairment group, rs5978930 was associated with total tau levels and rs16947151 
was associated with cognitive function scores at baseline and over time, 
suggesting that ABI3 variants may be associated with cognitive decline and may 
influence AD onset through tau pathology.

Tau PET has allowed for critical insights into in vivo patterns of tau 
accumulation and change in individuals early in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
continuum. A key methodological step in tau PET analyses is the selection of a 
reference region, but there is not yet consensus on the optimal region 
especially for longitudinal tau PET analyses. This study examines how reference 
region selection influences results related to disease stage at baseline and 
over time. Longitudinal flortaucipir ([18F]-AV1451) PET scans were examined 
using several common reference regions (e.g., eroded subcortical white matter, 
inferior cerebellar gray matter) in 62 clinically unimpaired amyloid negative 
(CU A-) individuals, 73 CU amyloid positive (CU A+) individuals, and 64 amyloid 
positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI A+) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cross-sectionally, both 
reference regions resulted in robust group differences between CU A-, CU A+, and 
MCI A+ groups, along with significant associations with CSF phosphorylated tau 
(pTau-181). However, these results were more focally specific and akin to Braak 
Staging when using eroded white matter, whereas effects with inferior cerebellum 
were globally distributed across most cortical regions. Longitudinally, 
utilization of eroded white matter revealed significant accumulation greater 
than zero across more regions whereas change over time was diminished using 
inferior cerebellum. Interestingly, the inferior temporal target region seemed 
most robust to reference region selection with expected cross-sectional and 
longitudinal signal across both reference regions. With few exceptions, baseline 
tau did not significantly predict longitudinal change in tau in the same region 
regardless of reference region. In summary, reference region selection deserves 
further evaluation as this methodological step may lead to disparate findings. 
Inferior cerebellar gray matter may be more sensitive to cross-sectional 
flortaucipir differences, whereas eroded subcortical white matter may be more 
sensitive for longitudinal analyses examining regional patterns of change.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the cognitive profile and 
prospective cognitive changes in non-demented adults with elevated Modified 
Dementia Risk Scores (MDRS), while also exploring the potential relationship 
between these associations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neuroinflammation.
METHODS: Within the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) 
database, 994 participants without dementia were assessed on MDRS, CSF 
biomarkers and cognition. We examined the associations of the MDRS with CSF 
biomarkers and cognitive scores using linear regressions. Causal mediation 
analyses were conducted to analyze the associations among MDRS, brain 
pathologies, and cognition. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) study was used to validate the mediation effects and to investigate the 
longitudinal association between MDRS and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: The results revealed that higher MDRS were linked to poorer cognitive 
performance (Model 1: PFDR  < 0.001; Model 2: PFDR  < 0.001) and increases in 
CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (P-tau, Model 1: PFDR  < 0.001; Model 2: PFDR 
 < 0.001), total tau (T-tau, Model 1: PFDR  < 0.001; Model 2: PFDR  < 0.001), 
P-tau/Aβ42 ratio (Model 1: PFDR  = 0.023; Model 2: PFDR  = 0.028), T-tau/Aβ42 
ratio (Model 1: PFDR  < 0.001; Model 2: PFDR  < 0.001) and soluble triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTrem2, Model 1: PFDR  < 0.001; Model 2: 
PFDR  < 0.001) in the CABLE study. The impact of MDRS on cognition was partially 
mediated by neuroinflammation and tau pathology. These mediation effects were 
replicated in the ADNI study. Baseline MDRS were significantly associated with 
future cognitive decline, as indicated by lower scores on the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE, Model 1: PFDR  = 0.045; Model 2: PFDR  < 0.001), ADNI 
composite memory score (ADNI-MEM, Model 1: PFDR  = 0.005; Model 2: PFDR 
 < 0.001), ADNI composite executive function score (ADNI-EF, Model 1: PFDR 
 = 0.045; Model 2: PFDR  < 0.001), and higher score on the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale (ADAS13, Model 1: PFDR  = 0.045; Model 2: PFDR  < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: The findings of this study revealed significant associations between 
MDRS and cognitive decline, suggesting a potential role of tau pathology and 
neuroinflammation in the link between MDRS and poorer cognitive performance in 
individuals without dementia. Consequently, the MDRS holds promise as a tool for 
targeted preventive interventions in individuals at high risk of cognitive 
impairment.

BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) rs3764650 has been 
identified to be a susceptibility locus for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its 
role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins was still unclear.
METHODS: The associations of rs3764650 with CSF Aβ1-42, t-tau and p-tau were 
analyzed in non-dementia AD, including preclinical and prodromal AD from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
RESULTS: Finally, GG + GT genotypes significantly decreased CSF Aβ1-42 level, 
but did not alter CSF t-tau and p-tau levels in non-dementia AD at baseline, 
which was further confirmed in longitudinal studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings supported that ABCA7 modified AD risk by altering Aβ 
deposition rather than tau pathology.

β-Amyloid pathology is elevated in ~30% of cognitively normal people over 65, 
and is associated with accelerated neurodegeneration in the pre-clinical stages 
of Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings reveal that brain iron might also act to 
propel neurodegeneration in people with underlying amyloid pathology. Here, 
repeated PET scans of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were used as a biomarker for 
brain hypometabolism and a downstream biomarker of neurodegeneration to 
investigate whether levels of ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; a 
reporter of brain iron load) are associated with prodromal disease progression 
of people with high β-amyloid pathology determined by established cut-off values 
in CSF t-tau/Aβ42 ratio. Nineteen cognitively normal participants with low 
t-tau/Aβ42, and 71 participants with high t-tau/Aβ42 who were cognitively normal 
or had mild cognitive impairment were included as participants from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. These subjects had 
repeated FDG-PET scans at 6-month intervals for 2 years, and yearly intervals 
for up to a further 3 years. In mixed-effects linear models of FDG signal, 
baseline CSF ferritin was associated with an accelerated decline in FDG PET in 
high t-tau/Aβ42 participants (β[SE] = -0.066 [0.017]; P = .0002), but not in 
people with low t-tau/Aβ42 (-0.029 [0.049]; P = .554). These data implicate iron 
as a contributing factor to neurodegeneration associated with β-amyloid 
pathology, and highlight CSF ferritin as a complementary prognostic biomarker to 
the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio that predicts near-term risk for disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a state between normal cognition 
and dementia. However, MCI diagnosis does not necessarily guarantee the 
progression to dementia. Since no previous study investigated brain positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging of MCI-- to-normal reversion, we provided PET 
imaging of MCI- to-normal reversion using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database.
METHODS: We applied comprehensive neuropsychological criteria (NP criteria), 
consisting of memory, language, and attention/executive function domains, to 
include patients with a baseline diagnosis of MCI (n=613). According to the 
criteria, the year 1 status of the patients was categorized into three groups 
(reversion: n=105, stable MCI: n=422, conversion: n=86). Demographic, 
neuropsychological, genetic, CSF, and cognition biomarker variables were 
compared between the groups. Additionally, after adjustment for confounding 
variables, the deposition pattern of amyloid-β and cerebral glucose metabolism 
were compared between three groups via AV45- and FDG-PET modalities, 
respectively.
RESULTS: MCI reversion rate was 17.1% during one year of follow-up. The 
reversion group had the lowest frequency of APOE ε4+ subjects, the highest CSF 
level of amyloid-β, and the lowest CSF levels of t-tau and p-tau. 
Neuropsychological assessments were also suggestive of better cognitive 
performance in the reversion group. Patients with reversion to normal state had 
higher glucose metabolism in bilateral angular and left middle/inferior temporal 
gyri, when compared to those with stable MCI state. Meanwhile, lower amyloid-β 
deposition at baseline was observed in the frontal and parietal regions of the 
reverted subjects. On the other hand, the conversion group showed lower cerebral 
glucose metabolism in bilateral angular and bilateral middle/inferior temporal 
gyri compared to the stable MCI group, whereas the amyloid-β accumulation was 
similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: This longitudinal study provides novel insight regarding the 
application of PET imaging in predicting MCI transition over time.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal tau proteins are independent contributors to cognitive 
impairment. Nevertheless, not all individuals exposed to high-level tau 
pathology will develop cognitive dysfunction. We aimed to construct a model to 
predict cognitive trajectory for this high-risk population.
METHOD: Longitudinal data of 181 non-demented adults (mean age= 73.1; female= 
45%), who were determined to have high cerebral burden of abnormal tau by 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of phosphorylated tau (ptau181) or total 
tau, were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Cognitive decline was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination scores 
decline ≥ 3 over three years. A predictive nomogram was constructed using 
stepwise backward regression method. The discrimination, calibration, and 
clinical usefulness of the nomogram were evaluated. The model was validated in 
another 189 non-demented adults via a cross-sectional set (n=149, mean age = 
73.9, female = 51%) and a longitudinal set (n= 40, mean age = 75, female = 48%). 
Finally, the relationships of the calculated risk scores with cognitive decline 
and risk of Alzheimer's disease were examined during an extended 8-year 
follow-up.
RESULT: Lower volume of hippocampus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, p< 0.001), lower 
levels of CSF sTREM2 (OR = 0.76, p = 0.003), higher scores of Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (OR = 1.15, p = 0.001) and Functional 
Activities Questionnaire (OR = 1.16, p = 0.016), and number of APOE ε4 (OR = 
1.88, p = 0.039) were associated with higher risk of cognitive decline 
independent of the amyloid status and were included in the final model. The 
nomogram had an area of under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 for training set, 0.93 
for cross-sectional validation set, and 0.91 for longitudinal validation set. 
Over the 8-year follow-up, the high-risk group exhibited faster cognitive 
decline (p< 0.001) and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia (HR= 
6.21, 95% CI= 3.61-10.66, p< 0.001 ).
CONCLUSION: APOE ε4 status, brain reserve capability, neuroinflammatory marker, 
and neuropsychological scores can help predict cognitive decline in non-demented 
adults with high burden of tau pathology, independent of the presence of amyloid 
pathology.

BACKGROUND: The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and increasing age are 
two of the most important known risk factors for developing Alzheimer disease 
(AD). The diagnosis of AD based on clinical symptoms alone is known to have poor 
specificity; recently developed diagnostic criteria based on biomarkers that 
reflect underlying AD neuropathology allow better assessment of the strength of 
the associations of risk factors with AD. Accordingly, we examined the global 
and age-specific association between APOE genotype and AD by using the A/T/N 
classification, relying on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid 
peptide (A, β-amyloid deposition), phosphorylated tau (T, pathologic tau), and 
total tau (N, neurodegeneration) to identify patients with AD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This case-control study included 1,593 white AD cases 
(55.4% women; mean age 72.8 [range = 44-96] years) with abnormal values of CSF 
biomarkers from nine European memory clinics and the American Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. A total of 11,723 dementia-free 
controls (47.1% women; mean age 65.6 [range = 44-94] years) were drawn from two 
longitudinal cohort studies (Whitehall II and Three-City), in which incident 
cases of dementia over the follow-up were excluded from the control population. 
Odds ratio (OR) and population attributable fraction (PAF) for AD associated 
with APOE genotypes were determined, overall and by 5-year age categories. In 
total, 63.4% of patients with AD and 22.6% of population controls carried at 
least one APOE ε4 allele. Compared with non-ε4 carriers, heterozygous ε4 
carriers had a 4.6 (95% confidence interval 4.1-5.2; p < 0.001) and ε4/ε4 
homozygotes a 25.4 (20.4-31.2; p < 0.001) higher OR of AD in unadjusted 
analysis. This association was modified by age (p for interaction < 0.001). The 
PAF associated with carrying at least one ε4 allele was greatest in the 65-70 
age group (69.7%) and weaker before 55 years (14.2%) and after 85 years (22.6%). 
The protective effect of APOE ε2 allele for AD was unaffected by age. Main study 
limitations are that analyses were based on white individuals and AD cases were 
drawn from memory centers, which may not be representative of the general 
population of patients with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that AD diagnosis based on biomarkers was 
associated with APOE ε4 carrier status, with a higher OR than previously 
reported from studies based on only clinical AD criteria. This association 
differs according to age, with the strongest effect at 65-70 years. These 
findings highlight the need for early interventions for dementia prevention to 
mitigate the effect of APOE ε4 at the population level.

OBJECTIVES: To examine trajectories of depression and apathy over a 5-year 
follow-up period in (prodromal) Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to relate these 
trajectories to AD biomarkers.
METHODS: The trajectories of depression and apathy (measured with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory or its questionnaire) were separately modeled using 
growth mixture models for two cohorts (National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, 
NACC, n = 22 760 and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI, n = 1 
733). The trajectories in ADNI were associated with baseline CSF AD biomarkers 
(Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau) using bias-corrected multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Multiple classes were identified, with the largest classes having no 
symptoms over time. Lower Aβ42 and higher tau (ie, more AD pathology) was 
associated with increased probability of depression and apathy over time, 
compared to classes without symptoms. Lower Aβ42 (but not tau) was associated 
with a steep increase of apathy, whereas higher tau (but not Aβ42 ) was 
associated with a steep decrease of apathy.
DISCUSSION: The trajectories of depression and apathy in individuals on the AD 
spectrum are associated with AD biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers have been 
considered diagnostic biomarkers for a long time, special attention has been 
recently dedicated to lipoproteins and metabolites that could be potentially 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration. Herein, we aimed to 
investigate the relationship between the levels of CSF core biomarkers including 
Aβ-42, TAU, and P-TAU and plasma lipoproteins and metabolites of patients with 
AD from the baseline cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database.
METHOD: Using the ADNI database, fourteen subclasses of lipoproteins as well as 
a number of lipids and fatty acids and low-molecular metabolites including amino 
acids, ketone bodies, and glycolysis-related metabolites in blood samples were 
measured as potential noninvasive markers, and their association with the CSF 
core biomarkers was statistically investigated controlling for age and gender.
RESULTS: A total number of 251 AD subjects were included, among whom 71 subjects 
were negative for the Apo-E ε4 allele and 150 were positive. There was no 
significant difference between the two groups regarding cognitive assessments, 
CSF core biomarkers, and lipoproteins and metabolites except the level of Aβ-42 
(p < 0.001) and phenylalanine (p = 0.049), which were higher in the negative 
group. CSF TAU and P-TAU were significantly correlated with medium and small HDL 
in the negative group, and with extremely large VLDL in the positive group. Our 
results also indicated significant correlations of metabolites including 
unsaturated fatty acids, glycerol, and leucine with CSF core biomarkers.
CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, a number of lipoproteins and metabolites were 
associated with CSF core biomarkers of AD. These correlations showed some 
differences in Apo-E ε4 positive and negative groups, which reminds the role of 
Apo-E gene status in the pathophysiology of AD development. However, further 
research is warranted to explore the exact association of lipoproteins and other 
metabolites with AD core biomarkers and pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Tau PET imaging has emerged as an important tool to detect and 
monitor tangle burden in vivo in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous 
studies demonstrated the association of tau burden with cognitive decline in 
probable AD cohorts. This study introduces a novel approach to analyze tau PET 
data by constructing individualized tau network structure and deriving its graph 
theory-based measures. We hypothesize that the network- based measures are a 
measure of the total tau load and the stage through disease.
METHODS: Using tau PET data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative from 369 
participants, we determine the network measures, global efficiency, global 
strength, and limbic strength, and compare with two regional measures entorhinal 
and tau composite SUVR, in the ability to differentiate, cognitively unimpaired 
(CU), MCI and AD. We also investigate the correlation of these network and 
regional measures and a measure of memory performance, auditory verbal learning 
test for long-term recall memory (AVLT-LTM). Finally, we determine the stages 
based on global efficiency and limbic strength using conditional inference trees 
and compare with Braak staging.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that the derived network measures are able to 
differentiate three clinical stages of AD, CU, MCI, and AD. We also demonstrate 
that these network measures are strongly correlated with memory performance 
overall. Unlike regional tau measurements, the tau network measures were 
significantly associated with AVLT-LTM even in cognitively unimpaired 
individuals. Stages determined from global efficiency and limbic strength, 
visually resembled Braak staging.
DISCUSSION: The strong correlations with memory particularly in CU suggest the 
proposed technique may be used to characterize subtle early tau accumulation. 
Further investigation is ongoing to examine this technique in a longitudinal 
setting.

INTRODUCTION: Altered lipid metabolism is implicated in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but the mechanisms remain obscure. Aging-related declines in circulating 
plasmalogens containing omega-3 fatty acids may increase AD risk by reducing 
plasmalogen availability.
METHODS: We measured four ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtns) and four closely 
related phosphatidylethanolamines (PtdEtns) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 1547 serum) and University of Pennsylvania 
(UPenn; n = 112 plasma) cohorts, and derived indices reflecting PlsEtn and 
PtdEtn metabolism: PL-PX (PlsEtns), PL/PE (PlsEtn/PtdEtn ratios), and PBV 
(plasmalogen biosynthesis value; a composite index). We tested associations with 
baseline diagnosis, cognition, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: Results revealed statistically significant negative relationships in 
ADNI between AD versus CN with PL-PX (P = 0.007) and PBV (P = 0.005), late mild 
cognitive impairment (LMCI) versus cognitively normal (CN) with PL-PX (P = 2.89 
× 10-5 ) and PBV (P = 1.99 × 10-4 ), and AD versus LMCI with PL/PE (P = 1.85 × 
10-4 ). In the UPenn cohort, AD versus CN diagnosis associated negatively with 
PL/PE (P = 0.0191) and PBV (P = 0.0296). In ADNI, cognition was negatively 
associated with plasmalogen indices, including Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale 13-item cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13; PL-PX: P = 3.24 × 10-6 ; PBV: P = 
6.92 × 10-5 ) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; PL-PX: P = 1.28 × 10-9 ; 
PBV: P = 6.50 × 10-9 ). In the UPenn cohort, there was a trend toward a similar 
relationship of MMSE with PL/PE (P = 0.0949). In ADNI, CSF total-tau was 
negatively associated with PL-PX (P = 5.55 × 10-6 ) and PBV (P = 7.77 × 10-6 ). 
Additionally, CSF t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio was negatively associated with these same 
indices (PL-PX, P = 2.73 × 10-6 ; PBV, P = 4.39 × 10-6 ). In the UPenn cohort, 
PL/PE was negatively associated with CSF total-tau (P = 0.031) and t-tau/Aβ1-42 
(P = 0.021). CSF Aβ1-42 was not significantly associated with any of these 
indices in either cohort.
DISCUSSION: These data extend previous studies by showing an association of 
decreased plasmalogen indices with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
cognition, and CSF tau. Future studies are needed to better define mechanistic 
relationships, and to test the effects of interventions designed to replete 
serum plasmalogens.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) levels of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Aβ1-42, t-tau, 
and p-tau) and 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 
hypometabolism in subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 
and specifically to determine which index of neurodegeneration was most 
frequently affected. The secondary objective was to determine the most 
frequently hypometabolic region in patients with a CSF AD signature (abnormal 
Aβ1-42 and abnormal p-tau). We included the 372 subjects (85 normal subjects, 
212 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 75 patients with AD) with a CSF 
biomarker dosage (Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau) and brain FDG-PET. The relationship 
between FDG-PET metabolism (in five regions of interest (ROI) known to be 
damaged in AD) and CSF t-tau and p-tau levels was studied as a function of CSF 
Aβ1-42 status. FDG-PET hypometabolism and CSF t-tau and p-tau levels were 
correlated only in patients with an abnormal CSF Aβ1-42 level (t-tau: 
R2 = 0.044, p = 0.001; p-tau: R2 = 0.02, p = 0.03). In the latter patients, CSF 
p-tau was the most frequently (p = 0.0001) abnormal neurodegeneration marker 
(p-tau: 92.8%; FDG-PET: 56.5%; CSF t-tau: 59.1%). Within the five ROI of FDG 
PET, the angular gyrus metabolism (R2 = 0.149; p = 0.0001) was selected as the 
most tightly associated with CSF AD signature. The relation between CSF markers 
of neurodegeneration (p-tau and t-tau) and brain hypometabolism (in FDG-PET) is 
conditioned by presence of amyloid abnormality. This finding supports the 
current physiopathological model of AD. P-tau is the most frequently impaired 
biomarker. Using FDG PET angular gyrus hypometabolism is the most sensitive to 
CSF-biomarker-defined AD.

BACKGROUND: The Centiloid scale has been developed to standardize measurements 
of amyloid PET imaging. Reference cut-off values of this continuous measurement 
enable the consistent operationalization of decision-making for multicentre 
research studies and clinical trials. In this study, we aimed at deriving 
reference Centiloid thresholds that maximize the agreement against core 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in two large 
independent cohorts.
METHODS: A total of 516 participants of the ALFA+ Study (N = 205) and ADNI 
(N = 311) underwent amyloid PET imaging ([18F]flutemetamol and [18F]florbetapir, 
respectively) and core AD CSF biomarker determination using Elecsys® tests. 
Tracer uptake was quantified in Centiloid units (CL). Optimal Centiloid cut-offs 
were sought that maximize the agreement between PET and dichotomous 
determinations based on CSF levels of Aβ42, tTau, pTau, and their ratios, using 
pre-established reference cut-off values. To this end, a receiver operating 
characteristic analysis (ROC) was conducted, and Centiloid cut-offs were 
calculated as those that maximized the Youden's J Index or the overall 
percentage agreement recorded.
RESULTS: All Centiloid cut-offs fell within the range of 25-35, except for CSF 
Aβ42 that rendered an optimal cut-off value of 12 CL. As expected, the agreement 
of tau/Aβ42 ratios was higher than that of CSF Aβ42. Centiloid cut-off 
robustness was confirmed even when established in an independent cohort and 
against variations of CSF cut-offs.
CONCLUSIONS: A cut-off of 12 CL matches previously reported values derived 
against postmortem measures of AD neuropathology. Together with these previous 
findings, our results flag two relevant inflection points that would serve as 
boundary of different stages of amyloid pathology: one around 12 CL that marks 
the transition from the absence of pathology to subtle pathology and another one 
around 30 CL indicating the presence of established pathology. The derivation of 
robust and generalizable cut-offs for core AD biomarkers requires cohorts with 
adequate representation of intermediate levels.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the association of APOE with amyloid 
deposition, cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) of Aβ, tau, and p-tau, brain 
atrophy, cognition and cognitive complaints in E-MCI patients and cognitively 
healthy older adults (HC) in the ADNI-2 cohort.
METHODS: Two-hundred and nine E-MCI and 123 HC participants from the ADNI-2 
cohort were included. We evaluated the impact of diagnostic status (E-MCI vs. 
HC) and APOE ε4 status (ε4 positive vs. ε4 negative) on cortical amyloid 
deposition (AV-45/Florbetapir SUVR PET scans), brain atrophy (structural MRI 
scans processed using voxel-based morphometry and Freesurfer version 5.1), CSF 
levels of Aβ, tau, and p-tau, and cognitive performance and complaints.
RESULTS: E-MCI participants showed significantly impaired cognition, higher 
levels of cognitive complaints, greater levels of tau and p-tau, and subcortical 
and cortical atrophy relative to HC participants (p < 0.05). Cortical amyloid 
deposition and CSF levels of Aβ were significantly associated with APOE ε4 
status but not E-MCI diagnosis, with ε4 positive participants showing more 
amyloid deposition and lower levels of CSF Aβ than ε4 negative participants. 
Other effects of APOE ε4 status on cognition and CSF tau levels were also 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE ε4 status is associated with amyloid accumulation and lower 
CSF Aβ, as well as increased CSF tau levels in early prodromal stages of AD 
(E-MCI) and HC. Alternatively, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and 
increased complaints are primarily associated with a diagnosis of E-MCI. These 
findings underscore the importance of considering APOE genotype when evaluating 
biomarkers in early stages of disease.

In Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), identifying a high risk of conversion to 
Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (AD) is a primary goal for patient management. 
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely employed to pursue data-driven 
diagnostic and prognostic goals. An agreement on the stability of these 
algorithms -when applied to different biomarkers and other conditions- is far 
from being reached. In this study, we compared the different prognostic 
performances of three supervised ML algorithms fed with multimodal biomarkers of 
MCI subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
algorithms predict MCI conversion to AD. They can also be simultaneously 
employed -with the voting procedure- to improve predictivity. AD prediction 
accuracy is influenced by the nature of the data (i.e., neuropsychological test 
scores, cerebrospinal fluid AD-related proteins and APOE ε4, cerebral structural 
MRI (sMRI) data). In our study, independent of the applied ML algorithms, sMRI 
data showed the lowest accuracy (0.79) compared to other classes. Multimodal 
data were helpful in the algorithms' performances by combining clinical and 
biological measures. Accordingly, using the three ML algorithms, the highest 
accuracy (0.90) was reached by employing neuropsychological and AD-related 
biomarkers. Finally, the feature selection procedure indicated that the most 
critical variables in the respective classes were the ADAS-Cog-13 scale, the 
medial temporal lobe and hippocampus atrophy, and the ratio between 
phosphorylated Tau and Aβ42 proteins. In conclusion, our data support the notion 
that using multiple ML algorithms and multimodal biomarkers helps make more 
accurate and solid predictions.

β-blockers that easily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) seem to diminish the 
risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), hypothetically facilitating waste clearance. 
However, their effect on AD pathophysiological markers is unknown. We compared 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker levels among non-demented individuals 
taking low, intermediate, or high BBB permeable β-blockers in two samples (ADNI: 
n = 216; EPAD: n = 79). We found that CSF amyloid-β levels were higher in 
individuals taking highly permeable β-blockers in the ADNI sample. This result 
was not replicated in EPAD, in which diminished levels of pTau181 and tTau were 
observed. These data suggest that β-blockers may impact AD pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) plays important roles in the 
pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: We sought blood BMP6 involved in the processes underlying cognitive 
decline and detected them in association with AD.
METHODS: A total of 309 participants in Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC) and 
547 participants in Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort 
were included. Blood BMP6 and cognitive functions were measured in all subjects 
of both cohorts at baseline, and in 482 subjects of ADNI cohort after one year. 
A total of 300 subjects in ADNI cohort were detected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
tau biomarker, and 244 received 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: AD patients had lower levels of blood BMP6 compared to normal controls, 
and BMP6 was positively associated with cognitive functions. Longitudinal BMP6 
combing with APOE genotype could distinguish probable AD from normal controls. 
The influence of blood BMP6 on cognition was modulated by tau pathology.
CONCLUSION: Blood BMP6 was associated with cognitive performance and identified 
as a potential predictor for probable AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits considerable phenotypic 
heterogeneity, suggesting the potential existence of subtypes. AD is under 
substantial genetic influence, thus identifying systematic variation in genetic 
risk may provide insights into disease origins.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated genetic heterogeneity in AD risk through a multi-step 
analysis.
METHODS: We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on AD-associated 
variants in the UK Biobank (AD cases = 2,739, controls = 5,478) to assess 
structured genetic heterogeneity. Subsequently, a biclustering algorithm 
searched for distinct disease-specific genetic signatures among subsets of 
cases. Replication tests were conducted using the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (AD cases = 500, controls = 470). We 
categorized a separate set of ADNI individuals with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI; n = 399) into genetic subtypes and examined cognitive, amyloid, and tau 
trajectories.
RESULTS: PCA revealed three distinct clusters ("constellations") driven 
primarily by different correlation patterns in a region of strong LD surrounding 
the MAPT locus. Constellations contained a mixture of cases and controls, 
reflecting disease-relevant but not disease-specific structure. We found two 
disease-specific biclusters among AD cases. Pathway analysis linked 
bicluster-associated variants to neuron morphogenesis and outgrowth. 
Disease-relevant and disease-specific structure replicated in ADNI, and 
bicluster 2 exhibited increased cerebrospinal fluid p-tau and cognitive decline 
over time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study unveils a hierarchical structure of AD genetic risk. 
Disease-relevant constellations may represent haplotype structure that does not 
increase risk directly but may alter the relative importance of other genetic 
risk factors. Biclusters may represent distinct AD genetic subtypes. This 
structure is replicable and relates to differential pathological accumulation

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits considerable phenotypic 
heterogeneity, suggesting the potential existence of subtypes. AD is under 
substantial genetic influence, thus identifying systematic variation in genetic 
risk may provide insights into disease origins.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated genetic heterogeneity in AD risk through a multi-step 
analysis.
METHODS: We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on AD-associated 
variants in the UK Biobank (AD cases=2,739, controls=5,478) to assess structured 
genetic heterogeneity. Subsequently, a biclustering algorithm searched for 
distinct disease-specific genetic signatures among subsets of cases. Replication 
tests were conducted using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset (AD cases=500, controls=470). We categorized a separate set of 
ADNI individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=399) into genetic 
subtypes and examined cognitive, amyloid, and tau trajectories.
RESULTS: PCA revealed three distinct clusters ("constellations") driven 
primarily by different correlation patterns in a region of strong LD surrounding 
the MAPT locus. Constellations contained a mixture of cases and controls, 
reflecting disease-relevant but not disease-specific structure. We found two 
disease-specific biclusters among AD cases. Pathway analysis linked 
bicluster-associated variants to neuron morphogenesis and outgrowth. 
Disease-relevant and disease-specific structure replicated in ADNI, and 
bicluster 2 exhibited increased CSF p-tau and cognitive decline over time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study unveils a hierarchical structure of AD genetic risk. 
Disease-relevant constellations may represent haplotype structure that does not 
increase risk directly but may alter the relative importance of other genetic 
risk factors. Biclusters may represent distinct AD genetic subtypes. This 
structure is replicable and relates to differential pathological accumulation 
and cognitive decline over time.

The pathophysiology of negative affect states in older adults is complex, and a 
host of central nervous system and peripheral systemic mechanisms may play 
primary or contributing roles. We conducted an unbiased analysis of 146 plasma 
analytes in a multiplex biochemical biomarker study in relation to number of 
depressive symptoms endorsed by 566 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) at their baseline and 1-year assessments. 
Analytes that were most highly associated with depressive symptoms included 
hepatocyte growth factor, insulin polypeptides, pregnancy-associated plasma 
protein-A and vascular endothelial growth factor. Separate regression models 
assessed contributions of past history of psychiatric illness, antidepressant or 
other psychotropic medicine, apolipoprotein E genotype, body mass index, serum 
glucose and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) τ and amyloid levels, and none of these 
values significantly attenuated the main effects of the candidate analyte levels 
for depressive symptoms score. Ensemble machine learning with Random Forests 
found good accuracy (~80%) in classifying groups with and without depressive 
symptoms. These data begin to identify biochemical biomarkers of depressive 
symptoms in older adults that may be useful in investigations of 
pathophysiological mechanisms of depression in aging and neurodegenerative 
dementias and as targets of novel treatment approaches.

This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional associations between 
regional Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including tau, β-amyloid (Aβ), and 
brain volume, within the Papez circuit, and neuropsychological functioning 
across the preclinical and clinical spectrum of AD. We utilized data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 251 
Aβ-positive participants. Participants were categorized into three groups based 
on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR): 73 individuals with preclinical AD 
(CDR = 0), 114 with prodromal AD (CDR = 0.5), and 64 with clinical AD dementia 
(CDR ≥ 1). Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, gender, and education 
years, were employed to evaluate the associations between five regions of 
interest (the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior 
cingulate cortex, and thalamus) and five neuropsychological tests across the 
three imaging modalities. In the preclinical stage of AD, flortaucipir PET was 
associated with impaired global cognition and episodic memory (range 
standardized β = 0.255-0.498, p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons), 
while florbetapir PET and brain volume were marginally related to global 
cognition (range standardized β = 0.221-0.231, p < 0.05). In the clinical stages 
of AD (prodromal and dementia), both increased flortaucipir uptake and decreased 
brain volume were significantly associated with poorer global neuropsychological 
and episodic memory performance (range standardized β = 0.222-0.621, p < 0.05, 
most regions of interest survived correction for multiple comparisions). 
However, a slight relationship was observed between florbetapir uptake and 
poorer global cognitive function. The regions most affected by flortaucipir PET 
were the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. During 
the clinical stages, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibited the most 
significant volumetric changes. Tau PET and brain volume measurements within the 
Papez circuit are more sensitive indicators of early cognitive deficits in AD 
than Aβ PET. Furthermore, during the clinical stages of AD, both flortaucipir 
PET and brain volume of the Papez circuit are closely correlated with cognitive 
decline. These findings underscore the importance of integrating multiple 
biomarkers for the comprehensive evaluation of AD pathology and its impact on 
cognition.

CONTEXT: There is no rapid and cost effective tool that can be implemented as a 
front-line screening tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the population level.
OBJECTIVE: To generate and cross-validate a blood-based screener for AD that 
yields acceptable accuracy across both serum and plasma.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of serum biomarker proteins were 
conducted on 197 Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants and 199 control 
participants from the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium (TARC) with further 
analysis conducted on plasma proteins from 112 AD and 52 control participants 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The full algorithm 
was derived from a biomarker risk score, clinical lab (glucose, triglycerides, 
total cholesterol, homocysteine), and demographic (age, gender, education, 
APOE*E4 status) data.
MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: 11 proteins met our criteria and were utilized for the biomarker risk 
score. The random forest (RF) biomarker risk score from the TARC serum samples 
(training set) yielded adequate accuracy in the ADNI plasma sample (training 
set) (AUC = 0.70, sensitivity (SN) = 0.54 and specificity (SP) = 0.78), which 
was below that obtained from ADNI cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analyses (t-tau/Aβ 
ratio AUC = 0.92). However, the full algorithm yielded excellent accuracy 
(AUC = 0.88, SN = 0.75, and SP = 0.91). The likelihood ratio of having AD based 
on a positive test finding (LR+) = 7.03 (SE = 1.17; 95% CI = 4.49-14.47), the 
likelihood ratio of not having AD based on the algorithm (LR-) = 3.55 
(SE = 1.15; 2.22-5.71), and the odds ratio of AD were calculated in the ADNI 
cohort (OR) = 28.70 (1.55; 95% CI = 11.86-69.47).
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to create a blood-based screening algorithm that 
works across both serum and plasma that provides a comparable screening accuracy 
to that obtained from CSF analyses.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common and highly heritable with many 
genes and gene variants associated with AD in one or more studies, including 
APOE ε2/ε3/ε4. However, the genetic backgrounds for normal cognition, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in terms of changes in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) levels of Aβ1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P, have not been clearly delineated. 
We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better define 
the genetic backgrounds to these three states in relation to CSF levels.
METHODS: Subjects were participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). The GWAS dataset consisted of 818 participants (mainly 
Caucasian) genotyped using the Illumina Human Genome 610 Quad BeadChips. This 
sample included 410 subjects (119 Normal, 115 MCI and 176 AD) with measurements 
of CSF Aβ1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P Levels. We used PLINK to find genetic 
associations with the three CSF biomarker levels. Association of each of the 
498,205 SNPs was tested using additive, dominant, and general association models 
while considering APOE genotype and age. Finally, an effort was made to better 
identify relevant biochemical pathways for associated genes using the ALIGATOR 
software.
RESULTS: We found that there were some associations with APOE genotype although 
CSF levels were about the same for each subject group; CSF Aβ1-42 levels 
decreased with APOE gene dose for each subject group. T-tau levels tended to be 
higher among AD cases than among normal subjects. From adjusted result using 
APOE genotype and age as covariates, no SNP was associated with CSF levels among 
AD subjects. CYP19A1 'aromatase' (rs2899472), NCAM2, and multiple SNPs located 
on chromosome 10 near the ARL5B gene demonstrated the strongest associations 
with Aβ1-42 in normal subjects. Two genes found to be near the top SNPs, CYP19A1 
(rs2899472, p = 1.90 × 10(-7)) and NCAM2 (rs1022442, p = 2.75 × 10(-7)) have 
been reported as genetic factors related to the progression of AD from previous 
studies. In AD subjects, APOE ε2/ε3 and ε2/ε4 genotypes were associated with 
elevated T-tau levels and ε4/ε4 genotype was associated with elevated T-tau and 
P-tau181P levels. Pathway analysis detected several biological pathways 
implicated in Normal with CSF β-amyloid peptide (Aβ1-42).
CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide association analysis identified several SNPs as 
important factors for CSF biomarker. We also provide new evidence for additional 
candidate genetic risk factors from pathway analysis that can be tested in 
further studies.

BACKGROUND: Recent biomarker studies demonstrated that the central nervous 
system (CNS) environment can be observed from peripherally-derived samples. In a 
previous study, we demonstrated significant hypomethylation of the BRCA1 
promoter region in neuronal cells from post-mortem brains of Alzheimer's disease 
patients through neuron-specific methylome analysis. Thus, we investigate the 
methylation changes in the BRCA1 promoter region in the blood samples.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the methylation level of the BRCA1 promoter in peripheral 
blood from AD patients and normal controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Genomic DNA samples from peripheral blood were 
obtained from the J-ADNI repository, and their biomarker data were obtained 
J-ADNI from the National Bioscience Database Center. Genomic DNA samples from an 
independent cohort for validation was obtained from Niigata University Hospital 
(Niigata, Japan). Amyloid positivity was defied by visual inspection of amyloid 
PET or a CSF Aβ42 value ≤ 333 pg/mL at the baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Methylation level of the BRCA1 promoter was analyzed by 
pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, methylation of the BRCA1 promoter in AD 
patients was not significantly changed; however, in AD patients, it showed a 
positive correlation with AD risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirmed the importance of cell-type specific methylome 
analysis and also suggested that environmental changes in the CNS can be 
detected by observing the peripheral blood, implying that the peripheral BRCA1 
methylation level can be a surrogate for AD.

INTRODUCTION: CSF α-synuclein seed amplification assay (SAA) is a sensitive and 
specific tool for detecting Lewy body (LB) co-pathology in AD.
METHODS: 1637 cross-sectional and 407 longitudinal CSF samples from ADNI were 
tested with SAA. We examined longitudinal dynamics of Aβ, α-synuclein seeds, and 
p-tau181, along with global and domain-specific cognition in stable SAA+, stable 
SAA-, and those who converted to SAA+ from SAA-.
RESULTS: SAA+ individuals had faster cognitive decline than SAA-, notably in 
MCI, and presented with earlier symptom onset. SAA+ conversion was associated 
with CSF Aβ42-positivity but did not impact progression of either Aβ42 or 
p-tau181 status. Aβ42, p-tau181, and α-syn SAA were all strong predictors of 
clinical progression, particularly Aβ42. In vitro α-syn SAA kinetic parameters 
were associated with participant demographics, clinical profiles, and cognitive 
decline.
DISCUSSION: These results highlight the interplay between Aβ and α-synuclein and 
their association with disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
abnormal proteins, such as β-amyloid and tau, in the brain, which precedes 
cognitive impairment. Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk 
factor for AD, few studies have investigated how the presence of DM affects the 
sequential pathogenesis of AD, specifically within the 
amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) and cognition framework.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the trajectories of ATN biomarkers in 
relation to the presence of DM in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD.
DESIGN: Participants with normal cognition (CN) or mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) at baseline were included. Subjects were followed for 12-192 months, with 
neuroimaging and cognitive assessments conducted at every 12 or 24 months.
SETTING: This study utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 603 participants aged 55-90 years were included, 
comprising 284 CN (25 with DM, 259 without DM) and 319 MCI (39 with DM, 280 
without DM) individuals.
MEASUREMENTS: ATN biomarkers were identified using florbetapir positron emission 
tomography (PET), flortaucipir PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
respectively. Cognition was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes (CDR-SB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Moderation analysis was 
conducted to investigate the effect of DM on the association between ATN 
biomarkers of AD.
RESULTS: Elevated amyloid standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were 
associated with increased tau levels in the hippocampus, and this association 
was significantly enhanced by the presence of DM in MCI participants 
(p = 0.021). DM also strengthened the association between increased tau SUVR 
levels and neurodegeneration (indicated by decreased entorhinal cortical 
volumes; p = 0.005) in those with MCI. Furthermore, DM enhanced the association 
of decreased entorhinal (p = 0.012) and middle temporal cortex (p = 0.031) 
volumes with increased (worsened) CDR-SB scores in MCI participants. However, DM 
did not predict significant longitudinal changes in ATN pathology or cognitive 
decline in CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DM may increase the risk of AD by 
accelerating each step of the A-T-N cascade in the prodromal stage of AD, 
underscoring the importance of DM management in preventing the MCI conversion to 
AD.

Alzheimer disease (AD) exhibits spatially heterogeneous 3- or 4-repeat tau 
deposition across participants. Our overall goal was to develop an automated 
method to quantify the heterogeneous burden of tau deposition into a single 
number that would be clinically useful. Methods: We used tau PET scans from 3 
independent cohorts: the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease 
Research Center (Mayo, n = 1,290), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI, n = 831), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 
(OASIS-3, n = 430). A machine learning binary classification model was trained 
on Mayo data and validated on ADNI and OASIS-3 with the goal of predicting 
visual tau positivity (as determined by 3 raters following Food and Drug 
Administration criteria for 18F-flortaucipir). The machine learning model used 
region-specific SUV ratios scaled to cerebellar crus uptake. We estimated 
feature contributions based on an artificial intelligence-explainable method 
(Shapley additive explanations) and formulated a global tau summary measure, Tau 
Heterogeneity Evaluation in Alzheimer's Disease (THETA) score, using SUV ratios 
and Shapley additive explanations for each participant. We compared the 
performance of THETA with that of commonly used meta-regions of interest (ROIs) 
using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes, clinical diagnosis, and histopathologic staging. Results: The model 
achieved a balanced accuracy of 95% on the Mayo test set and at least 87% on the 
validation sets. It classified tau-positive and -negative participants with an 
AUC of 1.00, 0.96, and 0.94 on the Mayo, ADNI, and OASIS-3 cohorts, 
respectively. Across all cohorts, THETA showed a better correlation with the 
Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (ρ ≥ 
0.45, P < 0.05) than did meta-ROIs (ρ < 0.44, P < 0.05) and discriminated 
between participants who were cognitively unimpaired and those who had mild 
cognitive impairment with an effect size of 10.09, compared with an effect size 
of 3.08 for meta-ROIs. Conclusion: Our proposed approach identifies positive tau 
PET scans and provides a quantitative summary measure, THETA, that effectively 
captures heterogeneous tau deposition observed in AD. The application of THETA 
for quantifying tau PET in AD exhibits great potential.

Inflammatory changes are among the key markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
related pathological changes. Pro-inflammatory analytes have been related to 
cognitive decline while others have been related to attenuating neuronal death. 
Among them, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) and soluble tumor necrosis factor 
receptor 2 (sTNFR2) have been described as impacting favorable clinical outcomes 
in AD. We therefore evaluate the effect of CSF sTREM2 and sTNFR2 when taken 
together on AD biomarkers and longitudinal clinical decline to understand their 
relative role on impacting AD clinical biomarkers and subsequent clinical 
outcomes. This longitudinal observational cohort study included 168 
amyloid-positive (A+) and p-tau-positive (T+) participants with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) with 109 of them having concomitant CSF sTREM2 and sTNFR2 data 
and 48 A+ T+ participants with MCI from a tertiary memory clinic cohort. An 
exploratory analysis was performed using data from 86 cognitively normal (CN) 
participants from ADNI with 72 of them having concomitant CSF AD biomarkers and 
CSF sTREM2 and sTNFR2 data. General linear models were used to evaluate the 
effect of sTREM2 and sTNFR2 levels on baseline CSF Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau, and a 
linear mixed-effects model was used to assess longitudinal cognitive change 
after controlling for well-known covariates. Among ADNI A+ T+ MCI and AD 
dementia participants, CSF sTNFR2 had a stronger association, than CSF sTREM2, 
with CSF t-tau and p-tau. This was replicated among A+ T+ MCI participants from 
the memory clinic cohort. On the contrary, among A+ T+ CN participants, CSF 
sTREM2 explained significant variance in CSF t-tau and p-tau, while CSF sTNFR2 
did not. When the effects of CSF sTNFR2 and t-tau on longitudinal cognitive 
change were taken into account, higher CSF sTREM2 predicted slower cognitive 
decline in A+ T+ AD dementia participants and faster decline in A+ T+ CN 
participants. Our results show that given the dynamic changes in sTREM2 and 
sTNFR2, the clinical impact of these distinct inflammation related biomarkers in 
tracking AD temporal progression across disease stages are likely to differ.

INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) studies of tau 
accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have noted reduced increases or frank 
decreases in tau signal. We investigated how such reductions related to 
analytical confounds and disease progression markers in atypical AD.
METHODS: We assessed regional and interindividual variation in longitudinal 
change on 18 F-flortaucipir PET imaging in 24 amyloid beta (Aβ)+ patients with 
atypical, early-onset amnestic or non-amnestic AD plus 62 Aβ- and 132 Aβ+ 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants.
RESULTS: In atypical AD, 18 F-flortaucipir uptake slowed or declined over time 
in areas with high baseline signal and older, more impaired individuals. ADNI 
participants had reduced longitudinal change in early Braak stage regions 
relative to late-stage areas.
DISCUSSION: Results suggested radioligand uptake plateaus or declines in 
advanced neurodegeneration. Further research should investigate whether results 
generalize to other radioligands and whether they relate to changes of the 
radioligand binding site structure or accessibility.

BACKGROUND: Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) has been identified as one of the most 
associated loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and recently was reported to 
modulate tau pathology to mediate AD in vitro. However, the effects of BIN1 on 
the AD related biomarkers in AD continuum were not specifically assessed.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the effects of BIN1 loci on AD specific biomarkers (CSF 
proteins, brain structures, glucose and amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolisms) to 
investigate the role BIN1 in AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: We calculated the associations of BIN1 loci with these markers at 
baseline and follow-up in multiple linear models in 812 ADNI subjects.
RESULTS: BIN1 loci were significantly associated with the levels of T-tau 
(rs744373: pc = 0.047, rs13031703: pc = 0.042) and P-tau (rs744373: pc = 0.044, 
rs13031703: pc = 0.019), but not with Aβ in CSF test. BIN1 genotypes were 
strongly related to atrophy of hippocampus (rs7561528: pc = 0.011), CA1 
(rs1469980: pc = 0.029) and parahippocampus (rs72838284, pc = 0.017) on MRI, and 
to glucose metabolism on FDG-PET, but not to Aβ deposition on AV45-PET imaging. 
Furthermore, haplotype and subgroup analysis confirmed these significant 
findings. In addition, the loci associated with these markers were also 
identified to influence the risk for AD in the meta-analysis of 74 046 European 
individuals.
CONCLUSION: This study supported that BIN1 contributes to the risk of AD by 
altering neural degeneration (abnormal tau, brain atrophy and glucose 
metabolism) but not Aβ pathology.

BACKGROUND: Lipidomics may provide insight into biochemical processes driving 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and ensuing clinical trajectories.
OBJECTIVE: To identify a peripheral lipidomics signature associated with AD 
pathology and investigate its potential to predict clinical progression.
METHODS: We used Bayesian elastic net regression to select plasma lipid classes 
associated with the CSF pTau/Aβ42 ratio as a biomarker of AD pathology in 
preclinical and prodromal AD cases from the ADNI cohort. Consensus clustering of 
the selected lipid classes was used to identify lipidomic endophenotypes and 
study their association with clinical progression.
RESULTS: In the APOE4-adjusted model, ether-glycerophospholipids, 
lyso-glycerophospholipids, free-fatty acids, cholesterol esters, and complex 
sphingolipids were found to be associated with the CSF pTau/Aβ42 ratio. We found 
an optimal number of five lipidomic endophenotypes in the prodromal and 
preclinical cases, respectively. In the prodromal cases, these clusters differed 
with respect to the risk of clinical progression as measured by clinical 
dementia rating score conversion.
CONCLUSION: Lipid alterations can be captured at the earliest phases of AD. A 
lipidomic signature in blood may provide a dynamic overview of an individual's 
metabolic status and may support identifying different risks of clinical 
progression.

INTRODUCTION: Relationship between self- and informant memory concerns and tau 
aggregation was assessed in adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Regional mean standardized uptake value ratios were extracted from 
[18F]flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) scans of 82 at-risk adults 
in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Associations 
between self- and informant ECog memory scores and tau aggregation were analyzed 
on both regional and voxelwise bases. Analyses were completed both on the whole 
sample and restricted to amyloid-positive individuals only.
RESULTS: Memory concerns were associated with tau aggregation. Self-perception 
was more associated with frontal tau. In contrast, informant scores were more 
associated with parietal tau. This source-by-region interaction was more 
prominent in amyloid-positive participants and observed in both regional and 
voxelwise analyses.
DISCUSSION: Quantitative assessment of perceived memory functioning may be 
useful for screening older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Individuals 
and their informants may provide complementary information relating to the 
anatomical distribution of tau.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety, apathy and depression are common in subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and may herald Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
investigated whether these symptoms correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
markers for AD in subjects with MCI. Method Subjects with MCI (n=268) were 
selected from the 'Development of screening guidelines and criteria for 
pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease' (DESCRIPA) and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies. We measured amyloid β(1-42) protein 
(Aβ42) and total tau (t-tau) in CSF. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were measured 
with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were reported by 55 subjects (21%), anxiety by 35 
subjects (13%) and apathy by 49 subjects (18%). The presence of anxiety was 
associated with abnormal CSF Aβ42 [odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 1.6-3.3] and t-tau (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.9-3.6) concentrations and with the 
combination of abnormal concentrations of both Aβ42 and t-tau (OR 3.1, 95% CI 
2.0-4.7). The presence of agitation and irritability was associated with 
abnormal concentrations of Aβ42 (agitation: OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3; 
irritability: OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.3). Symptoms of depression and apathy were 
not related to any of the CSF markers.
CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with MCI, symptoms of anxiety, agitation and 
irritability may reflect underlying AD pathology, whereas symptoms of depression 
and apathy do not.

BACKGROUND: According to the new 'AT(N)' system, those with a normal amyloid 
biomarker but with abnormal tauopathy or biomarkers of neurodegeneration or 
neuronal injury, have been labeled suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology 
(SNAP). We aimed to estimate the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories 
of SNAP individuals in non-demented elders and its comparison with individual in 
the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology using 'AT(N)' system.
METHODS: We included individuals with available baseline cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ (A), CSF phosphorylated tau examination (T) and 18F-uorodeoxyglucose 
PET or volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (N) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database. Longitudinal change in clinical outcomes are 
assessed using linear mixed effects models. Conversion risk from cognitively 
normal (CN) to cognitively impairment, and conversion from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to dementia are assessed using multivariate Cox proportional 
hazard models.
RESULTS: Totally, 366 SNAP individuals were included (114 A-T-N-, 154 A-T + N-, 
54 A-T-N + and 44 A-T + N+) of whom 178 were CN and 188 were MCI. Compared with 
A-T-N-, CN elders with A-T + N-, A-T-N + and A-T + N + had a faster rate of 
ADNI-MEM score decline. Moreover, CN older individuals with A-T + N + also had a 
faster rate of decline in ADNI-MEM score than those with A-T + N- individuals. 
MCI patients with A-T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF decline 
and hippocampal volume loss compared with A-T-N- and A-T + N- profiles. CN older 
individuals with A-T + N + had an increased risk of conversion to cognitive 
impairment (CDR-GS ≥ 0.5) compared with A-T + N- and A-T-N-. In MCI patients, 
A-T + N + also had an increased risk of conversion to dementia compared with A-T 
+ N- and A-T-N-. Compared with A-T + N-, CN elders and MCI patients with A + T + 
N- and A + T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM score, ADNI-EF score decline, 
and hippocampal volume loss. CN individuals with A + T + N + had a faster rate 
of ADNI-EF score decline compare with A-T + N + individuals. Moreover, MCI 
patients with A + T + N + also had a faster rate of decline in ADNI-MEM score, 
ADNI-EF score and hippocampal volume loss than those with A-T + N + individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from clinical, imaging and biomarker studies on SNAP, 
and its comparison with AD pathophysiology offered an important foundation for 
future studies.

The structural connectivity (SC) of the medial temporal lobe and its associated 
cortical anterior temporal and posterior medial networks (MTL-AT-PM) is linked 
to pathologies and memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
neuroimaging analyses cannot tell us how SC changes occur in AD at the molecular 
level and do not provide a means of intervening to slow/prevent 
pathology-related changes in MTL-AT-PM SC. The current study aimed to understand 
how and where AD-related changes occur within MTL-AT-PM using proteomics. We 
used a 4-step approach in 101 older adults from a local sample, aiming to 
understand how proteins and SC in combination at the multivariate level predict 
AD pathology, and to identify specific proteins related to SC and AD pathology. 
Separately, we validated the discovered proteins in relation to SC and AD 
pathology using ADNI sample. We identified 12 latent factors linking proteins 
and SC; five showed significant relationships with AD pathology and/or episodic 
memory. Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins and tumor necrosis factor 
receptors, and hippocampal/parahippocampal edges contributed most to AD-related 
latent factors. Fast causal inference found protein-protein, protein-SC, and 
protein-pathology pathways, with seven proteins showing directional links to SC 
and AD-related neurodegeneration. We validated these results by identifying 
significant relationships between six available proteins with SC and 
amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau in ADNI. We identified multivariate 
relationships between proteins and MTL-AT-PM networks that add to our 
understanding of AD pathology and suggest specific non-pathological proteins 
that warrant further study in relation to brain networks and AD pathology as 
possible therapeutic targets.

Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia exhibit significant 
heterogeneity across clinical symptoms, atrophy patterns, and spatial 
distribution of Tau deposition. Most previous studies of AD heterogeneity have 
focused on atypical clinical subtypes, defined subtypes with a single modality, 
or restricted their analyses to a priori brain regions and cognitive tests. 
Here, we considered a data-driven hierarchical Bayesian model to identify latent 
factors from atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits simultaneously, thus 
exploiting the rich dimensionality within each modality. Unlike most previous 
studies, our model allows each factor to be expressed to varying degrees within 
an individual, in order to reflect potential multiple co-existing pathologies. 
By applying our model to ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants, we found three 
atrophy-cognitive factors. The first factor was associated with medial temporal 
lobe atrophy, episodic memory deficits and disorientation to time/place 
("MTL-Memory"). The second factor was associated with lateral temporal atrophy 
and language deficits ("Lateral Temporal-Language"). The third factor was 
associated with atrophy in posterior bilateral cortex, and visuospatial 
executive function deficits ("Posterior Cortical-Executive"). While the 
MTL-Memory and Posterior Cortical-Executive factors were discussed in previous 
literature, the Lateral Temporal-Language factor is novel and emerged only by 
considering atrophy and cognition jointly. Several analyses were performed to 
ensure generalizability, replicability and stability of the estimated factors. 
First, the factors generalized to new participants within a 10-fold 
cross-validation of ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants. Second, the factors were 
replicated in an independent ADNI-1 AD dementia cohort. Third, factor loadings 
of ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants were longitudinally stable, suggesting 
that these factors capture heterogeneity across patients, rather than 
longitudinal disease progression. Fourth, the model outperformed canonical 
correlation analysis at capturing associations between atrophy patterns and 
cognitive deficits. To explore the influence of the factors early in the disease 
process, factor loadings were estimated in ADNI-GO/2 mild cognitively impaired 
(MCI) participants. Although the associations between the atrophy patterns and 
cognitive profiles were weak in MCI compared to AD, we found that factor 
loadings were associated with inter-individual regional variation in Tau uptake. 
Taken together, these results suggest that distinct atrophy-cognitive patterns 
exist in typical Alzheimer's disease, and are associated with distinct patterns 
of Tau depositions before clinical dementia emerges.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ42) 
accompanied by brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Several recent studies have 
shown that Aβ42 accumulation is associated with gray matter (GM) changes prior 
to the development of cognitive impairment, in the so-called preclinical stage 
of the AD (pre-AD). It also has been proved that the GM atrophy profile is not 
linear, both in normal ageing but, especially, on AD. However, several other 
factors may influence this association and may have an impact on the 
generalization of results from different samples. In this work, we estimate 
differences in rates of GM volume change in cognitively healthy elders in 
association with baseline core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and 
assess to what these differences are sample dependent. We report the dependence 
of atrophy rates, measured in a two-year interval, on Aβ42, computed both over 
continuous and categorical values of Aβ42, at voxel-level (p < 0.001; k < 100) 
and corrected for sex, age and education. Analyses were performed jointly and 
separately, on two samples. The first sample was formed of 31 individuals (22 
Ctrl and 9 pre-AD), aged 60-80 and recruited at the Hospital Clinic of 
Barcelona. The second sample was a replica of the first one with subjects 
selected from the ADNI dataset. We also investigated the dependence of the GM 
atrophy rate on the basal levels of continuous p-tau and on the p-tau/Aβ42 
ratio. Correlation analyses on the whole sample showed a dependence of GM 
atrophy rates on Aβ42 in medial and orbital frontal, precuneus, cingulate, 
medial temporal regions and cerebellum. Correlations with p-tau were located in 
the left hippocampus, parahippocampus and striatal nuclei whereas correlation 
with p-tau/Aβ42 was mainly found in ventral and medial temporal areas. Regarding 
analyses performed separately, we found a substantial discrepancy of results 
between samples, illustrating the complexities of comparing two independent 
datasets even when using the same inclusion criteria. Such discrepancies may 
lead to significant differences in the sample size needed to detect a particular 
reduction on cerebral atrophy rates in prevention trials. Higher cognitive 
reserve and more advanced pathological progression in the ADNI sample could 
partially account for the observed discrepancies. Taken together, our findings 
in these two samples highlight the importance of comparing and merging 
independent datasets to draw more robust and generalizable conclusions on the 
structural changes in the preclinical stages of AD.

BACKGROUND: Tools for efficient evaluation of amyloid- and tau-PET images are 
needed in both clinical and research settings.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to validate a semi-automated image analysis 
methodology, called Biomarker Localization, Analysis, Visualization, Extraction, 
and Registration (BLAzER). We tested BLAzER using two different segmentation 
platforms, FreeSurfer (FS) and Neuroreader (NR), for regional brain PET 
quantification in participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) dataset.
METHODS: 127 amyloid-PET and 55 tau-PET studies with volumetric MRIs were 
obtained from ADNI. The BLAzER methodology utilizes segmentation of MR images by 
FS or NR, then visualizes and quantifies regional brain PET data using 
FDA-cleared software (MIM), enabling quality control to ensure optimal 
registration and to detect segmentation errors.
RESULTS: BLAzER analysis required ∼5 min plus segmentation time. BLAzER using FS 
segmentation showed strong agreement with ADNI for global amyloid-PET 
standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) (r = 0.9922, p < 0.001) and regional 
tau-PET SUVRs across all Braak staging regions (r > 0.97, p < 0.001) with high 
inter-operator reproducibility (ICC > 0.97) and nearly identical dichotomization 
as amyloid-positive or -negative (2 discrepant cases out of 127). Comparing FS 
versus NR segmentation with BLAzER, global SUVRs were strongly correlated for 
amyloid-PET (r = 0.9841, p < 0.001), but were systematically higher (4% on 
average) with NR, likely due to more inclusion of white matter with NR-defined 
regions.
CONCLUSIONS: BLAzER provides an efficient methodology for regional brain PET 
quantification. FDA-cleared components and visualization of registration reduce 
barriers between research and clinical applications.

AIM: Biomarkers and image markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as 
cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and p-tau, are effective predictors of cognitive 
decline or dementia. The aim of this study was to integrate these markers with a 
disease progression model and to identify their abnormal ranges.
METHODS: The data of 395 participants, including 86 normal subjects, 108 early 
mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) subjects, 120 late mild cognitive impairment 
(LMCI) subjects, and 81 AD subjects were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. For the participants, baseline and 
long-term data on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and p-tau, hippocampal volume, and 
ADAS-cog were available. Various linear and nonlinear models were tested to 
determine the associations among the ratio of Aβ42 to p-tau (the Ratio), 
hippocampal volume and ADAS-cog.
RESULTS: The most likely models for the Ratio, hippocampal volume, and ADAS-cog 
(logistic, Emax, and linear models, respectively) were used to construct the 
final model. Baseline disease state had an impact on all the 3 endpoints (the 
Ratio, hippocampal volume, and ADAS-cog), while APOEε4 genotype and age only 
influence the Ratio and hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSION: The Ratio can be used to identify the disease stage for an 
individual, and clinical measures integrated with the Ratio improve the accuracy 
of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD conversion forecasting.

BACKGROUND: As cognitive function declines with age, identifying factors 
affecting the trajectory of cognitive decline is an indispensable step toward 
developing intervention strategies to improve the quality of the elderly life.
OBJECTIVE: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on 
memory function to explore single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated 
with the rate of memory decline.
METHODS: Seven hundred and nine eligible non-Hispanic Caucasians from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included for analysis 
after quality control. GWAS was performed with linear regression. We 
subsequently tested whether the associations remained significant in subgroup 
analysis and also examined the impact of SNPs on the longitudinal changes in 
other neuropsychological measures and amyloid pathology.
RESULTS: We identified rs13374761-A in SLAMF1 gene associated with less memory 
decline (MAF = 0.071, β= 0.0103, p = 4.14×10-8). Subgroup analysis showed 
stability of results across groups with different diagnosis at baseline. 
Rs13374761-A also had protective effects on global cognition (p = 0.024), 
episodic memory (p = 0.024), and semantic memory (p = 0.042), and exerts 
protection against a decrease in CSF Aβ42 concentration (p = 0.0463) and an 
increase in Aβ loading in cerebral cortex (p = 0.00666) among minor allele 
carriers.
CONCLUSION: A novel variant in gene SLAMF1 affects the rate of memory decline in 
the aged population. Given the protective effect of this variant, SLAMF1 should 
be further investigated as a potential preventive and therapeutic target for 
monitoring cognition trajectories.

IMPORTANCE: Several studies suggest that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele 
modulates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42). Whether this 
effect is secondary to the association of the APOE ε4 allele with cortical Aβ 
deposition or whether APOE ε4 directly influences CSF levels of Aβ42 
independently of Aβ pathology remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the APOE genotype affects the diagnostic accuracy 
of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), in particular Aβ42 levels, and 
whether the association of APOE ε4 with CSF biomarkers depends on cortical Aβ 
status.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We collected data from 4 different centers in 
Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Cohort A consisted of 1345 individuals aged 23 to 
99 years with baseline CSF samples, including 309 with AD, 287 with prodromal 
AD, 399 with stable mild cognitive impairment, 99 with dementias other than AD, 
and 251 controls. Cohort B included 105 nondemented younger individuals (aged 
20-34 years) with CSF samples available. Cohort C included 118 patients aged 60 
to 80 years with mild cognitive symptoms who underwent flutemetamol F 18 
([18F]flumetamol) positron emission tomography amyloid imaging and CSF tap.
EXPOSURES: Standard care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ42 and total and 
phosphorylated tau in relation to the APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 polymorphism in different 
diagnostic groups and in cases with or without cortical uptake of 
[18F]flutemetamol.
RESULTS: The CSF levels of Aβ42 but not total and phosphorylated tau were lower 
in APOE ε4 carriers compared with noncarriers irrespective of diagnostic group 
(cohort A). Despite this, CSF levels of Aβ42 differed between participants with 
AD when compared with controls and those with stable mild cognitive impairment, 
even when stratifying for APOE genotype (P < .001 to P = .006). Multiple binary 
logistic regression revealed that CSF levels of Aβ42 and APOE ε4 genotype were 
independent predictors of AD diagnosis. In cohort B, APOE ε4 carrier status did 
not influence CSF levels of Aβ42. Moreover, when stratifying for cortical uptake 
of [18F]flutemetamol in cohort C, APOE ε4 genotype did not influence CSF levels 
of Aβ42. This result was replicated in a cohort with individuals from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using carbon 11-labeled 
Pittsburgh Compound B scanning.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ42 are strongly 
associated with the diagnosis of AD and cortical Aβ accumulation independent of 
APOE genotype. The clinical cutoff for CSF levels of Aβ42 should be the same for 
all APOE genotypes.

BACKGROUND: Although aging is the strongest risk factor for the development of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), it remains uncertain if the blood DNA methylation 
clock, which reflects the effect of biological aging on DNA methylation (DNAme) 
status of blood cells, may be used as a surrogate biomarker for AD pathology in 
the central nervous system (CNS).
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a practical model to predict for A/T/N-based AD 
biomarkers as the prediction targets using the aging acceleration of blood 
cells.
METHODS: We obtained data of North American ADNI study participants (n = 317) 
whose blood DNA methylation microarray (Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC 
Beadchips) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers (Aβ, t-tau, and p-tau) 
were recorded simultaneously. Methylation clock was calculated to conduct 
machine learning, in order to predict binary statuses (+ or -) for A 
(corresponding to the lowered CSF Aβ), T (the elevated CSF p-tau), or N (the 
elevated CSF t-tau). The predictive performance of the models was evaluated by 
area under curve (AUC) in the test subset within ADNI.
RESULTS: Among the 317 included samples, 194 (61.2%) were A+, 247 (77.9%) were 
T+, and 104 (32.8%) were N+. The degree of blood aging acceleration showed weak 
positive correlation with the CSF Aβ levels, even after adjustment with APOE 
genotype and other covariates. However, the contribution of aging acceleration 
to improve the predictive performance of models was not significant for any of 
A+, T+, or N+.
CONCLUSION: Our exploratory attempts could not demonstrate the substantial 
utility of the peripheral blood cells' methylation clock as a predictor for 
A/T/N-based CSF biomarkers of AD, and further additional work should be 
conducted to determine whether the blood DNAme signatures including methylation 
clock have substantial utility in detecting underlying amyloid, tau or 
neurodegeneration pathology of AD.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the predictive value of different classes of 
markers in the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) over an extended 4-year follow-up in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
METHODS: MCI patients were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG), and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers at baseline and were followed on a yearly 
basis for 4 years to ascertain progression to AD. Logistic regression models 
were fitted in clusters, including demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive 
markers, and biomarkers (morphometric, PET-FDG, CSF, amyloid-β, and tau).
RESULTS: The predictive model at 4 years revealed that two cognitive measures, 
an episodic memory measure and a Clock Drawing screening test, were the best 
predictors of conversion (area under the curve = 0.78).
CONCLUSIONS: This model of prediction is consistent with the previous model at 2 
years, thus highlighting the importance of cognitive measures in progression 
from MCI to AD. Cognitive markers were more robust predictors than biomarkers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of MRI-visible perivascular spaces 
(PVS) with cognitive impairment in military veterans with traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), and whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau and Aβ mediate this effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 55 Vietnam War veterans with a history of TBI 
and 52 non-TBI Vietnam War veterans from the Department of Defense Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. All the subjects had brain MRI, 
CSF p-tau, Aβ, and neuropsychological examinations. MRI-visible PVS number and 
grade were rated on MRI in the centrum semiovale (CSO-PVS) and basal ganglia 
(BG-PVS). Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the association 
between MRI-visible PVS and cognitive impairment and the interaction effect of 
TBI. Additionally, mediation effect of CSF biomarkers on the relationship 
between MRI-visible PVS and cognitive impairment was explored in TBI group.
RESULTS: Compared with military control, TBI group had higher CSO-PVS number (p 
= 0.001), CSF p-tau (p = 0.022) and poorer performance in verbal memory (p = 
0.022). High CSO-PVS number was associated with poor verbal memory in TBI group 
(β = -0.039, 95% CI -0.062, -0.016), but not in military control group (β = 
0.019, 95% CI -0.004, 0.043) (p-interaction = 0.003). Further mediation analysis 
revealed that CSF p-tau had a significant indirect effect (β = -0.009, 95% CI: 
-0.022 -0.001, p = 0.001) and mediated 18.75% effect for the relationship 
between CSO-PVS and verbal memory in TBI group.
CONCLUSION: MRI-visible CSO-PVS was more common in Vietnam War veterans with a 
history of TBI and was associated with poor verbal memory, mediated partially by 
CSF p-tau.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine if patterns of CSF inflammatory 
markers are correlated with global cognition, episodic memory, hippocampal 
volume, and CSF AD-related pathologies among non-demented older people.
METHODS: We included 217 non-demented older individuals, including 87 subjects 
with normal cognition (NC) and 130 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Hierarchical 
cluster analysis including nine inflammatory markers in CSF [Tumor necrosis 
factor-α(TNF-α), TNF-R1, TNF-R2, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), TGF-β2, 
TGF-β3, Interleukin-21 (IL-21), IL-6, and IL-7] was conducted.
RESULTS: We identified two clusters among non-demented older people based on 
nine inflammatory markers in CSF. Compared to the first cluster, the second 
cluster showed significantly higher levels of CSF inflammatory markers (TNF-R1, 
TNF-R2, TGF-β1, TGF-β3, and IL-6). Further, the second cluster was also 
associated with higher levels of t-tau and p-tau levels in CSF.
CONCLUSION: We observed a subgroup of non-demented older people characterized by 
increased levels of inflammatory markers in CSF. Further, this subgroup showed 
higher levels of t-tau and p-tau levels in CSF.

BACKGROUND: Current hypothetical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis 
emphasize the role of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau deposition, and neurodegenerative 
changes in the mesial temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal cortex and 
hippocampus. However, many individuals with clinical AD who come to autopsy also 
exhibit cerebrovascular disease. The relationship between AD and vascular 
pathology is unclear, especially whether they represent additive and independent 
effects on neuronal injury. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to (1) confirm whether entorhinal cortex and 
hippocampal volume are associated with memory among individuals with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for AD; and (2) determine 
whether regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, a radiological marker 
of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, is associated with entorhinal cortex 
and hippocampal volume independent of putative AD biomarkers in this group.
METHODS: Cognitive test scores, entorhinal cortex volume, hippocampus volume, 
intracranial volume, and cerebrospinal fluid-derived phosphorylated tau and 
Aβ1-42 protein levels were measured in 199 subjects with amnestic MCI (mean 
age = 74.89 ± 7.47). Lobar WMH volumes were derived from T1-, proton-density-, 
and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. We examined the association 
between entorhinal cortex volume and cognition. Next, we examined the 
association of tau and Aβ1-42 with entorhinal cortex volume and between lobar 
WMH and entorhinal cortex volume. Finally, tau, Aβ1-42, and regional WMH volumes 
were entered simultaneously to predict entorhinal cortex volume. We repeated the 
analyses with hippocampal volume instead of entorhinal cortex volume. The 
analyses were also repeated with the sample restricted to those MCI patients who 
transitioned to AD on subsequent ADNI follow-up visits (n = 86).
RESULTS: Larger entorhinal cortex volume was associated with better memory but 
not with performance on a task of executive functioning. Lower levels of Aβ1-42 
and higher temporal WMH volumes were associated with smaller entorhinal cortex 
volume. When entered simultaneously, temporal lobe WMH volume was more reliably 
associated with entorhinal cortex volume than was Aβ1-42. The findings were 
similar for hippocampus volume and when the sample was restricted to MCI 
patients who subsequently transitioned to AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the role of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 
volume in influencing memory decline in amnestic MCI, and emphasize that even in 
this nominally AD prodromal condition, WMH may be influencing regional 
neurodegeneration.

OBJECTIVE: We explored a novel model based on deep learning radiomics (DLR) to 
differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
patients and normal control (NC) subjects. This model was validated in an 
exploratory study using tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) scans.
METHODS: In this study, we selected tau-PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI), which included a total of 211 NC, 197 
MCI, and 117 AD subjects. The dataset was divided into one training/validation 
group and one separate external group for testing. The proposed DLR model 
contained the following three steps: (1) pre-training of candidate deep learning 
models; (2) extraction and selection of DLR features; (3) classification based 
on support vector machine (SVM). In the comparative experiments, we compared the 
DLR model with three traditional models, including the SUVR model, traditional 
radiomics model, and a clinical model. Ten-fold cross-validation was carried out 
200 times in the experiments.
RESULTS: Compared with other models, the DLR model achieved the best 
classification performance, with an accuracy of 90.76% ± 2.15% in NC vs. MCI, 
88.43% ± 2.32% in MCI vs. AD, and 99.92% ± 0.51% in NC vs. AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed DLR model had the potential clinical value to 
discriminate AD, MCI and NC.

OBJECTIVE: Develop a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker signature for mild 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
subjects.
METHODS: Amyloid-beta 1 to 42 peptide (A beta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and tau 
phosphorylated at the threonine 181 were measured in (1) cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) samples obtained during baseline evaluation of 100 mild AD, 196 mild 
cognitive impairment, and 114 elderly cognitively normal (NC) subjects in ADNI; 
and (2) independent 56 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 52 age-matched elderly NCs 
using a multiplex immunoassay. Detection of an AD CSF profile for t-tau and A 
beta(1-42) in ADNI subjects was achieved using receiver operating characteristic 
cut points and logistic regression models derived from the autopsy-confirmed CSF 
data.
RESULTS: CSF A beta(1-42) was the most sensitive biomarker for AD in the autopsy 
cohort of CSF samples: receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 
0.913 and sensitivity for AD detection of 96.4%. In the ADNI cohort, a logistic 
regression model for A beta(1-42), t-tau, and APO epsilon 4 allele count 
provided the best assessment delineation of mild AD. An AD-like baseline CSF 
profile for t-tau/A beta(1-42) was detected in 33 of 37 ADNI mild cognitive 
impairment subjects who converted to probable AD during the first year of the 
study.
INTERPRETATION: The CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by A beta(1-42) and 
t-tau in the autopsy-confirmed AD cohort and confirmed in the cohort followed in 
ADNI for 12 months detects mild AD in a large, multisite, prospective clinical 
investigation, and this signature appears to predict conversion from mild 
cognitive impairment to AD.

BACKGROUND: The percentage of verbal forgetting (VF%) measure of the Rey 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) has been proposed to differentiate 
patients diagnosed clinically with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB).
OBJECTIVE: To determine if VF% aligns with gold-standard biomarker and autopsy 
evidence of AD and DLB neuropathology.
METHODS: Clinical, cognitive, sociodemographic, and biomarker data were 
collected from 315 patients with baseline cognitive impairment and 485 normal 
controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). AD markers 
included reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β, elevated total-tau and 
phosphorylated-tau, hippocampal atrophy, and the presence of amyloid plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy. DLB markers included reduced CSF 
α-synuclein, preserved hippocampus, atrophied putamen, occipital glucose 
metabolism, and the presence of Lewy bodies at autopsy. Cognitively impaired 
participants were classified as ADVF% (n = 190) or DLBVF% (n = 125) based on 
their RAVLT VF% scores using a 75% cut-off (≥75%  = ADVF%, <75%  = DLBVF%). 
Postmortem data were available for 13 ADVF% participants, 13 DLBVF% patients, 
and six healthy controls.
RESULTS: ADVF% and DLBVF% participants did not differ on CSF or neuroimaging 
biomarkers, with the exception of total tau levels which were higher in ADVF%. 
In the subset of participants with autopsy data, comorbid AD and DLB pathology 
was most frequent in ADVF% participants, and pure DLB pathology was most 
frequent in DLBVF% participants, however, these differences were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The RAVLT VF% measure does not reliably align with AD and DLB 
neuropathology in ADNI participants.

Preclinical changes that precede the onset of symptoms and eventual diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a target for potential preventive interventions. A 
large body of evidence suggests that inflammation is closely associated with AD 
pathogenesis and may be a promising target pathway for such interventions. 
However, little is known about the association between systemic inflammation and 
preclinical AD pathophysiology. We first examined whether the acute-phase 
protein, alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M), a major component of the innate immune 
system, was associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of neuronal injury 
in preclinical AD and risk of incident AD in the predictors of cognitive decline 
among normal individuals (BIOCARD) cohort. We find that A2M concentration in 
blood is significantly associated with CSF concentrations of the neuronal injury 
markers, tau and phosphorylated tau, and that higher baseline serum A2M 
concentration is associated with an almost threefold greater risk of progression 
to clinical symptoms of AD in men. These findings were replicated in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) study. Then, utilizing a systems level 
approach combining large multi-tissue gene expression datasets with mass 
spectrometry-based proteomic analyses of brain tissue, we identified an A2M gene 
network that includes regulator of calcineurin (RCAN1), an inhibitor of 
calcineurin, a well-characterized tau phosphatase. A2M gene and protein 
expression in the brain were significantly associated with gene and protein 
expression levels of calcineurin. Collectively these novel findings suggest that 
A2M is associated with preclinical AD, reflects early neuronal injury in the 
disease course and may be responsive to tau phosphorylation in the brain through 
the RCAN1-calcineurin pathway.

The close correlation between abnormally low pre-mortem cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) concentrations of amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ(1-42)) and plaque burden measured by 
amyloid imaging as well as between pathologically increased levels of CSF tau 
and the extent of neurodegeneration measured by MRI has led to growing interest 
in using these biomarkers to predict the presence of AD plaque and tangle 
pathology. A challenge for the widespread use of these CSF biomarkers is the 
high variability in the assays used to measure these analytes which has been 
ascribed to multiple pre-analytical and analytical test performance factors. To 
address this challenge, we conducted a seven-center inter-laboratory 
standardization study for CSF total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (p-tau(181)) and 
Aβ(1-42) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
Aliquots prepared from five CSF pools assembled from multiple elderly controls 
(n = 3) and AD patients (n = 2) were the primary test samples analyzed in each 
of three analytical runs by the participating laboratories using a common batch 
of research use only immunoassay reagents (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, xMAP technology, 
from Innogenetics) on the Luminex analytical platform. To account for the 
combined effects on overall precision of CSF samples (fixed effect), different 
laboratories and analytical runs (random effects), these data were analyzed by 
mixed-effects modeling with the following results: within center %CV 95% CI 
values (mean) of 4.0-6.0% (5.3%) for CSF Aβ(1-42); 6.4-6.8% (6.7%) for t-tau and 
5.5-18.0% (10.8%) for p-tau(181) and inter-center %CV 95% CI range of 15.9-19.8% 
(17.9%) for Aβ(1-42), 9.6-15.2% (13.1%) for t-tau and 11.3-18.2% (14.6%) for 
p-tau(181). Long-term experience by the ADNI biomarker core laboratory 
replicated this degree of within-center precision. Diagnostic threshold CSF 
concentrations for Aβ(1-42) and for the ratio t-tau/Aβ(1-42) were determined in 
an ADNI independent, autopsy-confirmed AD cohort from whom ante-mortem CSF was 
obtained, and a clinically defined group of cognitively normal controls (NCs) 
provides statistically significant separation of those who progressed from MCI 
to AD in the ADNI study. These data suggest that interrogation of ante-mortem 
CSF in cognitively impaired individuals to determine levels of t-tau, p-tau(181) 
and Aβ(1-42), together with MRI and amyloid imaging biomarkers, could replace 
autopsy confirmation of AD plaque and tangle pathology as the "gold standard" 
for the diagnosis of definite AD in the near future.

The choroid plexus (ChP) is a major source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
production, with a direct and indirect role in protein clearance, and 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested the link between the 
ChP volume and levels of CSF proteins in 2 data sets of (i) healthy controls, 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 509), and (ii) healthy controls and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers 
Initiative (N = 302). All patients had baseline CSF proteins (amyloid-β, total 
and phosphorylated-tau and α-synuclein (only in Parkinson's Progression Markers 
Initiative)). ChP was automatically segmented on 3T structural T1-weighted MRIs. 
We found negative associations between ChP volume and CSF proteins, which were 
stronger in healthy controls, early-MCI patients, and PD patients compared with 
late-MCI and AD patients. Further grouping of patients of ADNI dataset into 
amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative based on their florbetapir (AV45) PET 
imaging showed that the association between ChP volume and CSF proteins 
(t/p-tau) was lower in amyloid-positive group. Our findings support the possible 
role of ChP in the clearance of CSF proteins, provide evidence for ChP 
dysfunction in AD, and suggest the need to account for the ChP volume in future 
studies of CSF-based biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Besides their other roles, brain imaging and other biomarkers of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have the potential to inform a cognitively unimpaired 
(CU) person's likelihood of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
benefit subject selection when evaluating promising prevention therapies. We 
previously described that among baseline FDG-PET and MRI measures known to be 
preferentially affected in the preclinical and clinical stages of AD, 
hippocampal volume was the best predictor of incident MCI within 2 years 
(79%sensitivity/78%specificity), using standard automated MRI volumetric 
algorithmic programs, binary logistic regression, and leave-one-out procedures.
OBJECTIVE: To improve the same prediction by using different hippocampal 
features and machine learning methods, cross-validated via two independent and 
prospective cohorts (Arizona and ADNI).
METHODS: Patch-based sparse coding algorithms were applied to hippocampal 
surface features of baseline TI-MRIs from 78 CU adults who subsequently 
progressed to amnestic MCI in approximately 2 years ("progressors") and 80 
matched adults who remained CU for at least 4 years ("nonprogressors"). 
Nonprogressors and progressors were matched for age, sex, education, and 
apolipoprotein E4 allele dose. We did not include amyloid or tau biomarkers in 
defining MCI.
RESULTS: We achieved 92%prediction accuracy in the Arizona cohort, 92%prediction 
accuracy in the ADNI cohort, and 90%prediction accuracy when combining the two 
demographically distinct cohorts, as compared to 79%(Arizona) and 72%(ADNI) 
prediction accuracy using hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSION: Surface multivariate morphometry and sparse coding, applied to 
individual MRIs, may accurately predict imminent progression to MCI even in the 
absence of other AD biomarkers.

A family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases one's risk of developing 
late-onset AD (LOAD), and a maternal family history of LOAD influences risk more 
than a paternal family history. Accumulating evidence suggests that a family 
history of dementia associates with AD-typical biomarker changes. We analyzed 
cross-sectional data from non-demented, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
LOAD participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with 
PET imaging using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB, n = 99) and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) analysis (n = 403) for amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and total tau. We assessed 
the relationship of CSF and PiB biomarkers and family history of dementia, as 
well as parent gender effects. In the larger analysis of CSF biomarkers, we 
assessed diagnosis groups individually. In the overall sample, CSF Aβ, tau/Aβ 
ratio, and global PiB uptake were significantly different between family history 
positive and negative groups, with markers of increased AD burden associated 
with a positive maternal family history of dementia. Moreover, a maternal family 
history of dementia was associated with significantly greater PiB Aβ load in the 
brain in the parietal cortex, precuneus, and sensorimotor cortex. Individuals 
with MCI positive for a maternal family history of dementia had significantly 
more markers of AD pathophysiology than individuals with no family history of 
dementia. A family history of dementia is associated with AD-typical biomarker 
changes. These biomarker associations are most robust in individuals with a 
maternal family history, suggesting that a maternally inherited factor 
influences AD risk.

Studies of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have 
indicated that much of the variability observed in the biomarkers may be due to 
measurement error. Biomarkers are often obtained with measurement error, which 
may make the diagnostic biomarker appear less effective than it truly is. In the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, technical 
replicates of CSF biomarkers are available; the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center database contains longitudinal replicates of CSF biomarkers. 
We focus on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as 
the measure of diagnostic effectiveness for differentiating AD from normal 
cognition using CSF biomarkers and compare AUC estimates obtained by a more 
standard, naïve method (which uses a single observation per subject and ignores 
measurement error) to a maximum likelihood (ML) based method (which uses all 
replicates per subject and adjusts for measurement error). The choice of 
analysis method depends upon the noise to signal ratio (i.e., the magnitude of 
the measurement error variability relative to the true biomarker variability); 
moderate to high ratios may significantly bias the naïve AUC estimate, and the 
ML-based method would be preferred. The noise to signal ratios were low for the 
ADNI biomarkers but high for the tTau and pTau biomarkers in NACC. 
Correspondingly, the naïve and ML-based AUC estimates were nearly identical in 
the ADNI data but dissimilar for the tTau and pTau biomarkers in the NACC data. 
Therefore, using the naïve method is adequate for analysis of CSF biomarkers in 
the ADNI study, but the ML method is recommended for the NACC data.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases require characterization based on 
underlying biology using biochemical biomarkers. Mixed pathology complicates 
discovery of biomarkers and characterization of cohorts, but inclusion of 
greater numbers of patients with different, related diseases with frequently 
co-occurring pathology could allow better accuracy. Combining cohorts collected 
from different studies would be a more efficient use of resources than 
recruiting subjects from each population of interest for each study.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of combining existing datasets by 
controlling pre-analytic variables in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) studies.
METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected and processed from 30 subjects 
according to both the ADNI and PPMI protocols. Relationships between reported 
levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers in 
the same subject under each protocol were examined.
RESULTS: Protocol-related differences were observed for Aβ, but not t-tau or 
α-syn, and trended different for p-tau and pS129. Values of α-syn differed by 
platform. Conversion of α-syn values between ADNI and PPMI platforms did not 
completely eliminate differences in distribution.
DISCUSSION: Factors not captured in the pre-analytical sample handling influence 
reported biomarker values. Assay standardization and better harmonized 
characterization of cohorts should be included in future studies of CSF 
biomarkers.

Mounting evidence shows that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the 
propagation of tau aggregates throughout the brain in a prion-like manner. Since 
current pathology imaging technologies only provide a spatial mapping of tau 
accumulation, computational modeling becomes indispensable in analyzing the 
spatiotemporal propagation patterns of widespread tau aggregates from the 
longitudinal data. However, current state-of-the-art works focus on the 
longitudinal change of focal patterns, lacking a system-level understanding of 
the tau propagation mechanism that can explain and forecast the cascade of tau 
accumulation. To address this limitation, we conceptualize that the 
intercellular spreading of tau pathology forms a dynamic system where each node 
(brain region) is ubiquitously wired with other nodes while interacting with the 
build-up of pathological burdens. In this context, we formulate the biological 
process of tau spreading in a principled potential energy transport model 
(constrained by brain network topology), which allows us to develop an 
explainable neural network for uncovering the spatiotemporal dynamics of tau 
propagation from the longitudinal tau-PET scans. Specifically, we first 
translate the transport equation into a GNN (graph neural network) backbone, 
where the spreading flows are essentially driven by the potential energy of tau 
accumulation at each node. Conventional GNNs employ a l2-norm graph smoothness 
prior, resulting in nearly equal potential energies across nodes, leading to 
vanishing flows. Following this clue, we introduce the total variation (TV) into 
the graph transport model, where the nature of system's Euler-Lagrange equations 
is to maximize the spreading flow while minimizing the overall potential energy. 
On top of this min-max optimization scenario, we design a generative adversarial 
network (GAN-like) to characterize the TV-based spreading flow of tau 
aggregates, coined TauFlowNet. We evaluate our TauFlowNet on ADNI and OASIS 
datasets in terms of the prediction accuracy of future tau accumulation and 
explore the propagation mechanism of tau aggregates as the disease progresses. 
Compared to the current counterpart methods, our physics-informed deep model 
yields more accurate and interpretable results, demonstrating great potential in 
discovering novel neurobiological mechanisms through the lens of machine 
learning.

BACKGROUND: There is a clear need for simple and effective tests to identify 
individuals who are most likely to develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both for the 
purposes of clinical trial recruitment but also for improved management of 
patients who may be experiencing early pre-clinical symptoms or who have 
clinical concerns.
OBJECTIVES: To predict individuals at greatest risk of progression of cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease in individuals from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using a polygenic risk scoring algorithm. 
To compare the performance of a PRS algorithm in predicting cognitive decline 
against that of using the pTau/Aß1-42 ratio CSF biomarker profile.
DESIGN: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative study conducted across over 50 sites in the US and 
Canada.
SETTING: Multi-center genetics study.
PARTICPANTS: 515 subjects who upon entry to the study were diagnosed as 
cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment.
MEASUREMENTS: Use of genotyping and/or whole genome sequencing data to calculate 
polygenic risk scores and assess ability to predict subsequent cognitive decline 
as measured by CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog13 over 4 years.
RESULTS: The overall performance for predicting those individuals who would 
decline by at least 15 ADAS-Cog13 points from a baseline mild cognitive 
impairment in 4 years was 72.8% (CI:67.9-77.7) AUC increasing to 79.1% (CI: 
75.6-82.6) when also including cognitively normal participants. Assessing mild 
cognitive impaired subjects only and using a threshold of greater than 0.6, the 
high genetic risk participant group declined, on average, by 1.4 points (CDR-SB) 
more than the low risk group over 4 years. The performance of the PRS algorithm 
tested was similar to that of the pTau/Aß1-42 ratio CSF biomarker profile in 
predicting cognitive decline.
CONCLUSION: Calculating polygenic risk scores offers a simple and effective way, 
using DNA extracted from a simple mouth swab, to select mild cognitively 
impaired patients who are most likely to decline cognitively over the next four 
years.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein (α-syn) seed amplification 
assay (SAA) is a sensitive and specific tool for detecting Lewy body 
co-pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: A total of 1637 cross-sectional and 407 longitudinal CSF samples from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were tested with SAA. We 
examined longitudinal dynamics of amyloid beta (Aβ), α-syn seeds, and 
phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), along with global and domain-specific 
cognition in stable SAA+, stable SAA-, and those who converted to SAA+ from 
SAA-.
RESULTS: SAA+ individuals had faster cognitive decline than SAA-, notably in 
mild cognitive impairment, and presented with earlier symptom onset. SAA+ 
conversion was associated with CSF Aβ42 positivity but did not impact the 
progression of either CSF Aβ42 or CSF p-tau181 status. CSF Aβ42, p-tau181, and 
α-syn SAA were all strong predictors of clinical progression, particularly CSF 
Aβ42. In vitro, CSF α-syn SAA kinetic parameters were associated with 
participant demographics, clinical profiles, and cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: These results highlight the interplay between amyloid and α-syn and 
their association with disease progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Seed amplification assay (SAA) positivity was associated with 
greater cognitive decline and earlier symptom onset. Thirty-four Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) individuals progressed from SAA- to SAA+, 
that is, ≈ 5% conversion. SAA conversion was associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) 
pathology and greater cognitive decline. SAA status did not impact the 
progression of either CSF Aβ42 or phosphorylated tau181 biomarkers. Change in 
clinical diagnosis was associated with both Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and 
SAA. SAA kinetic parameters were associated with clinical features and 
progression.

BACKGROUND: The complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 gene (CR1) gene has been 
proved to affect the susceptibility of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different 
ethnic and districts groups. However, the effect of CR1 genetic variants on 
amyloid β (Aβ) metabolism of AD human is still unclear. Hence, the aim of this 
study was to investigate genetic influences of CR1 gene on Aβ metabolism.
METHODS: All data of AD patients and normal controls (NC) were obtained from 
alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative database (ADNI) database. In order 
to assess the effect of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CR1 on Aβ 
metabolism, the PLINK software was used to conduct the quality control 
procedures to enroll appropriate SNPs. Moreover, the correlation between CR1 
genotypes and Aβ metabolism in all participants were estimated with multiple 
linear regression models.
RESULTS: After quality control procedures, a total of 329 samples and 83 SNPs 
were enrolled in our study. Moreover, our results identified five SNPs 
(rs10494884, rs11118322, rs1323721, rs17259045 and rs41308433), which were 
linked to Aβ accumulation in brain. In further analyses, rs17259045 was found to 
decrease Aβ accumulation among AD patients. Additionally, our study revealed the 
genetic variants in rs12567945 could increase CSF Aβ42 in NC population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study had revealed several novel SNPs in CR1 genes which might 
be involved in the progression of AD via regulating Aβ accumulation. These 
findings will provide a new basis for the diagnosis and treatment AD.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays a role in neuronal survival and 
development, and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We sought to 
examine the associations of the CSF HGF with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology 
and cognitive function.
METHODS: A total of 238 participants (including 90 cognitively normal (CN) and 
148 mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) who had measurements of CSF HGF were 
included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
Multiple linear regression models were utilized to explore the cross-sectional 
associations of CSF HGF with AD biomarkers (including Aβ42, pTau, and tTau 
proteins) in non-demented participants. Moreover, linear mixed-effects 
regression models were utilized to explore the longitudinal associations of HGF 
subgroups with cognitive function. Mediation analyses were utilized to explore 
the mediation effects of AD markers.
RESULTS: MCI individuals had significantly increased CSF HGF compared with the 
CN individuals. Results of multiple linear regressions showed significant 
correlations of CSF HGF with CSF Aβ42, pTau, and tTau in non-demented 
participants. Higher level of baseline CSF HGF was associated with faster 
cognitive decline. Influences of the baseline CSF HGF on cognition were 
partially mediated by Aβ42, pTau, and tTau pathologies.
CONCLUSIONS: High concentrations of HGF in CSF may be related to faster 
cognitive decline. The cognitive consequences of higher CSF HGF partly stem from 
AD pathology, which suggests that the CSF HGF may be an attractive biomarker 
candidate to track AD progression.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has been 
pivotal in identifying and refining Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers for 
clinical trials. This study leverages longitudinal data from participants who 
have progressed to amyloid-positivity during their study participation to track 
evolution of biomarkers and cognitive function.
METHODS: We modeled AD biomarker (positron emission tomography [PET], 
structural, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], cognition) trajectories before and after 
observed amyloid-positivity onset time to detect time at which each biomarker 
had detectable trajectory changes.
RESULTS: Analysis of a sub-cohort of the 20-year ADNI study (N = 90) 
recapitulated Alzheimer's progression beginning with amyloid alterations -4.8 to 
-5.3 years relative to amyloid-positivity, succeeded by neurodegeneration 
(t = -4.0 to -4.1 years), and CSF tau (t = -0.4 to -0.5 years). Cognitive 
decline was observed to significantly correspond with emergence of 
amyloid-positivity (t = 0.2 to 2.4 years).
DISCUSSION: Our results corroborate temporal progression curves of AD 
biomarkers, providing insights on earliest detectable changes in objective and 
subjective cognitive function assessments.

Biomarker-assisted diagnosis and intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be 
the key to prevention breakthroughs. One of the hallmarks of AD is the 
accumulation of tau plaques in the human brain. However, current methods to 
detect tau pathology are either invasive (lumbar puncture) or quite costly and 
not widely available (Tau PET). In our previous work, structural MRI-based 
hippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) showed superior 
performance as an effective neurodegenerative biomarker for preclinical AD and 
Patch Analysis-based Surface Correntropy-induced Sparse coding and max-pooling 
(PASCS-MP) has excellent ability to generate low-dimensional representations 
with strong statistical power for brain amyloid prediction. In this work, we 
apply this framework together with ridge regression models to predict Tau 
deposition in Braak12 and Braak34 brain regions separately. We evaluate our 
framework on 925 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Each subject has one pair consisting of a PET image and MRI scan which 
were collected at about the same times. Experimental results suggest that the 
representations from our MMS and PASCS-MP have stronger predictive power and 
their predicted Braak12 and Braak34 are closer to the real values compared to 
the measures derived from other approaches such as hippocampal surface area and 
volume, and shape morphometry features based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM).

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the factors including 
neuropsychological test performances and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
which can predict disease progression of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a 
Japanese population.
METHODS: The group classification on early AD population in both Japanese 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) and North American ADNI 
(NA-ADNI) was performed using the inclusion criteria including brain amyloid 
positivity on positron emission tomography or CSF. Participants with early AD 
from each cohort were stratified into two groups based on a cutoff 1.0 of 
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) change at month 24 (m24): 
participants in "progress group" have CDR-SB change ≥ 1.0 and participants in 
"stable group" have CDR-SB change < 1.0. Then, we performed identification of 
prognostic factors from baseline items including neuropsychological scores 
(Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale[ADAS-cog 13], Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), CDR, FAQ, and Geriatric Depression Scale ), CSF markers (t-tau, p-tau, 
and beta-amyloid 1-42), vital signs (body weight, pulse rate, etc.,), by using 
two statistical approaches, Welch's t-test and simple linear regression by 
ordinary least squares. Comparisons between participants with J-ADNI and 
participants with NA-ADNI were also performed.
RESULTS: Trends of CDR-SB changes were very similar between J-ADNI and NA-ADNI 
early AD population enrolled in this study. Baseline levels of CSF t-tau, p-tau, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, FAQ, and ADAS-cog13 were identified as prognostic 
factors in both J-ADNI and NA-ADNI. Based on a detailed subscale analysis on 
ADAS-cog13, four subscales (Q1: word recall, Q3: construction, Q4: delayed word 
recall, and Q8: word recognition) were identified as prognostic factors in both 
J-ADNI and NA-ADNI.
DISCUSSION: Characterizing population with early AD can provide benefits for 
promoting efficiency in conducting AD clinical trials for disease-modifying 
treatments. Thus, implementing these prognostic factors into clinical trials may 
be potentially a good method to enrich participants with early AD who are 
suitable for evaluating treatment effects.

Purpose: To test whether correcting for unspecific signal from the cerebral 
white matter increases the sensitivity of amyloid-PET for early stages of 
cerebral amyloidosis. Methods: We analyzed 18F-Florbetapir-PET and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) Aβ42 data from 600 older individuals enrolled in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including people with normal cognition, 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We 
determined whether three compartmental partial volume correction (PVC-3), 
explicitly modeling signal spill-in from white matter, significantly improved 
the association of CSF Aβ42 levels with global 18F-Florbetapir-PET values 
compared with standard processing without PVC (non-PVC) and a widely used 
two-compartmental PVC method (PVC-2). In additional voxel-wise analyses, we 
determined the sensitivity of PVC-3 compared with non-PVC and PVC-2 for 
detecting early regional amyloid build-up as modeled by decreasing CSF Aβ42 
levels. For replication, we included an independent sample of 43 older 
individuals with subjective memory complaints from the INveStIGation of 
AlzHeimer's PredicTors cohort (INSIGHT-preAD study). Results: In the ADNI 
sample, PVC-3 18F-Florbetapir-PET values normalized to whole cerebellum signal 
showed significantly stronger associations with CSF Aβ42 levels than non-PVC or 
PVC-2, particularly in the lower range of amyloid levels. These effects were 
replicated in the INSIGHT-preAD sample. PVC-3 18F-Florbetapir-PET data detected 
regional amyloid build-up already at higher (less abnormal) CSF Aβ42 levels than 
non-PVC or PVC-2 data. Conclusion: A PVC approach that explicitly models 
unspecific white matter binding improves the sensitivity of amyloid-PET for 
identifying the earliest stages of cerebral amyloid pathology which has 
implications for future primary prevention trials.

PURPOSE: Automated diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease remain a 
challenging problem that machine learning (ML) techniques have attempted to 
resolve in the last decade. This study introduces a first-of-its-kind 
color-coded visualization mechanism driven by an integrated ML model to predict 
disease trajectory in a 2-year longitudinal study. The main aim of this study is 
to help capture visually in 2D and 3D renderings the diagnosis and prognosis of 
AD, therefore augmenting our understanding of the processes of multiclass 
classification and regression analysis.
METHOD: The proposed method, Machine Learning for Visualizing AD (ML4VisAD), is 
designed to predict disease progression through a visual output. This newly 
developed model takes baseline measurements as input to generate a color-coded 
visual image that reflects disease progression at different time points. The 
architecture of the network relies on convolutional neural networks. With 1123 
subjects selected from the ADNI QT-PAD dataset, we use a 10-fold 
cross-validation process to evaluate the method. Multimodal inputs* include 
neuroimaging data (MRI, PET), neuropsychological test scores (excluding MMSE, 
CDR-SB, and ADAS to avoid bias), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers with 
measures of amyloid beta (ABETA), phosphorylated tau protein (PTAU), total tau 
protein (TAU), and risk factors that include age, gender, years of education, 
and ApoE4 gene.
FINDINGS/RESULTS: Based on subjective scores reached by three raters, the 
results showed an accuracy of 0.82 ± 0.03 for a 3-way classification and 
0.68 ± 0.05 for a 5-way classification. The visual renderings were generated in 
0.08 msec for a 23 × 23 output image and in 0.17 ms for a 45 × 45 output image. 
Through visualization, this study (1) demonstrates that the ML visual output 
augments the prospects for a more accurate diagnosis and (2) highlights why 
multiclass classification and regression analysis are incredibly challenging. An 
online survey was conducted to gauge this visualization platform's merits and 
obtain valuable feedback from users. All implementation codes are shared online 
on GitHub.
CONCLUSION: This approach makes it possible to visualize the many nuances that 
lead to a specific classification or prediction in the disease trajectory, all 
in context to multimodal measurements taken at baseline. This ML model can serve 
as a multiclass classification and prediction model while reinforcing the 
diagnosis and prognosis capabilities by including a visualization platform.

Defining cases and controls on the basis of biomarkers rather than clinical 
diagnosis may reduce sample sizes required for genetic studies. The aim of this 
study was to assess whether characterizing case/control status on the basis of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile would increase power to replicate known 
genetic associations for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Independent of clinical 
diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects with 2 
CSF biomarkers for AD (Aβ1-42 < 192 pg/mL and tau phosphorylated at threonine 
181 (p-tau) > 23 pg/mL, "CSF-positive") were compared with those without CSF 
evidence for AD (Aβ1-42 > 192 pg/mL and 181-phosphorylated tau < 23 pg/mL, 
"CSF-negative"). Minor allele frequency (MAF) and odds ratios (ORs) between 
these 2 groups were calculated for 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
interest. Two hundred thirty-two individuals were CSF-positive and 94 
CSF-negative. There were no differences in age (74.7 ± 7.2 vs. 75.0 ± 6.5 years, 
p = 0.7), but significant differences in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
(25.9 ± 2.6 vs. 28.2 ± 1.7, p < 0.001) between the CSF-positive and CSF-negative 
groups. Significant differences in MAF (p < 0.05, uncorrected) were seen for CR1 
(rs1408077; OR, 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.49), PICALM 
(rs541458; OR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.47-0.98), TOMM40 (rs2075650; OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 
2.61-7.06); and possession of 1 or more APOE ε4 alleles (OR, 9.84; 95% CI, 
5.48-17.67). These results suggest that using biomarkers of AD pathology to 
define case and control status may increase power in genetic association 
studies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are emerging as critically 
important for disease detection and monitoring. Most biomarkers are obtained 
through invasive, resource-intense procedures. A cognitive marker, 
intra-individual cognitive variability (IICV) may provide an alternative or 
adjunct marker of disease risk for individuals unable or disinclined to undergo 
lumbar puncture.
OBJECTIVE: To contrast risk of incident AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
associated with IICV to risk associated with well-established biomarkers: 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau181) and amyloid-β 42 
(Aβ42) peptide.
METHODS: Dispersion in cognitive performance, IICV, was estimated with a 
published algorithm, and included Trail Making Test A and B, Rey Auditory Verbal 
Learning Test (RAVLT), and the American National Adult Reading Test (ANART). CSF 
biomarkers were expressed as a ratio: p-tau181/Aβ42, wherein high values 
signified pathognomonic profiles. Logistic regression models included 
longitudinal data from 349 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
participants who completed lumbar puncture. All subjects were cognitively 
healthy (n = 105) or diagnosed with MCI (n = 244) at baseline. We examined odds 
of conversion associated with baseline elevations in IICV and/or ratio of CSF 
p-tau181/Aβ42.
RESULTS: When included in models alone or in combination with CSF p-tau181/Aβ42, 
one standard IICV unit higher was associated with an estimated odds ratio for 
incident AD or MCI of 2.81 (95% CI: 1.83-4.33) in the most inclusive sample, and 
an odds ratio of 3.41 (95% CI: 2.03-5.73) when restricted to participants with 
MCI. Iterative analyses suggested that IICV independently improved model fit 
even when individual index components were included in comparative models.
CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide preliminary support for IICV as a marker of 
incident AD and MCI. This easily-disseminated, non-invasive marker compared 
favorably to well-established CSF biomarkers.

Accumulating data suggest cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurogranin (Ng) as a 
potential biomarker for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer 
disease (AD). To investigate whether the CSF Ng can be used for diagnosis, 
prognosis, and monitoring of AD, we examined 111 cognitively normal (CN) 
controls, 193 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 95 AD patients in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Correlations were 
tested between baseline CSF Ng levels and baseline core AD biomarkers and 
longitudinal glucose metabolism, brain atrophy and cognitive decline. We 
detected that CSF Ng levels increased with disease severity, and correlated with 
phosphorylated tau and total tau levels within each diagnostic group. High 
baseline CSF Ng levels correlated with longitudinal reductions in cortical 
glucose metabolism within each diagnostic group and hippocampal volume within 
MCI group during follow-up. In addition, high baseline CSF Ng levels correlated 
with cognitive decline as reflected by decreased cognitive scale scores. The CSF 
Ng levels predicted future cognitive impairment (adjusted hazard ratio:3.66, 
95%CI: 1.74-7.70, P = 0.001) in CN controls. These data demonstrate that CSF Ng 
offers diagnostic utility for AD and predicts future cognitive impairment in CN 
individuals and, therefore, may be a useful addition to the current AD 
biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have explored the application of non-invasive 
biomarkers of language dysfunction for the early detection of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, language dysfunction over time may be quite heterogeneous 
within different diagnostic groups.
METHOD: Patient demographics and clinical data were retrieved from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for the participants 
without dementia who had measures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and 
language dysfunction. We analyzed the effect of longitudinal neuropathological 
and clinical correlates in the pathological process of semantic fluency and 
confrontation naming. The mediation effects of AD biomarkers were also explored 
by the mediation analysis.
RESULT: There were 272 subjects without dementia included in this analysis. 
Higher rates of decline in semantic fluency and confrontation naming were 
associated with a higher risk of progression to MCI or AD, and a greater decline 
in cognitive abilities. Moreover, the rate of change in semantic fluency was 
significantly associated with Aβ deposition, while confrontation naming was 
significantly associated with both amyloidosis and tau burden. Mediation 
analyses revealed that both confrontation naming and semantic fluency were 
partially mediated by the Aβ aggregation.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the changes in language dysfunction may partly stem 
from the Aβ deposition, while confrontation naming can also partly originate 
from the increase in tau burden. Therefore, this study sheds light on how 
language dysfunction is partly constitutive of mild cognitive impairment and 
dementia and therefore is an important clinical predictor.

BACKGROUND: Being clinically diagnosed with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely studied. Yet, the clinical and 
structural neuroimaging characteristics for prodromal AD, which are defined as 
A+T+MCI based on the AT (N) system are still highly desirable. This study 
evaluates the differences of the cognitive assessments and structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) between the early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) 
participants based on the AT (N) system. The potential clinical value of the 
structural MRI as a predictor of cognitive decline during follow-up in prodromal 
AD is further investigated.
METHODS: A total of 406 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were chosen and dichotomized into EMCI 
and LMCI groups according to the Second Edition (Logical Memory II) Wechsler 
Memory Scale. Multiple markers' data was collected, including age, sex, years of 
education, ApoE4 status, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, standardized 
uptake values ratios (SUVR) means of florbetapir-PET-AV45, cognitive measures, 
and structural MRI. We chose 197 A+T+MCI participants (prodromal AD) with 
positive biomarkers of Aβ plaques (labeled "A") and fibrillar tau (labeled "T"). 
We diagnosed Aβ plaques positive by the SUVR means of florbetapir-PET-AV45 
(cut-off >1.1) and fibrillar tau positive by CSF phosphorylated-tau at threonine 
181 (p-tau) (cut-off >23 pg/mL). The differences of cognitive assessments and 
regions of interest (ROIs) defined on the MRI template between EMCI and LMCI 
were compared. Furthermore, the potential clinical utility of the MRI as the 
predictor of cognitive decline in prodromal AD was evaluated by investigating 
the relationship between baseline MRI markers and cognition decline at the 
follow-up period, through a linear regression model.
RESULTS: The LMCI participants had a significantly more amyloid burden and CSF 
levels of total t-tau than the EMCI participants. The LMCI participants scored a 
lower result than the EMCI group in the global cognition scales and subscales 
which included tests for memory, delayed recall memory, executive function, 
language, attention and visuospatial skills. The cognition levels declined 
faster in the LMCI participants during the 12- and 24-month follow-up. There 
were significant differences in ROIs on the structural MRI between the two 
groups, including a bilateral entorhinal, a bilateral hippocampus, a bilateral 
amygdala, a bilateral lateral ventricle and cingulate, a corpus callosum, and a 
left temporal. The thickness average of the left entorhinal, the left middle 
temporal, the left superior temporal, and the right isthmus cingulate was a main 
contributor to the decreased global cognition levels. The thickness average of 
the left superior temporal and bilateral entorhinal played a key role in the 
memory domain decline. The thickness average of the left middle temporal, and 
the right isthmus cingulate was significantly associated with an executive 
function decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the AT (N) system, surely, both the EMCI and LMCI 
diagnoses presented significant differences in multiple cognition domains. 
Signature ROIs from the structural MRI tests had correlated a cognitive decline, 
and could act as one potential predictive marker.

New therapies with disease-modifying effects are urgently needed for treating 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nerve growth factor (NGF) protein has demonstrated 
regenerative and neuroprotective effects on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons 
in animal studies. In addition, AD patients treated with NGF have previously 
shown improved cognition, EEG activity, nicotinic binding, and glucose 
metabolism. However, no study to date has analyzed brain atrophy in patients 
treated with NGF producing cells. In this study we present MRI results of the 
first clinical trial in patients with AD using encapsulated NGF biodelivery to 
the basal forebrain. Six AD patients received the treatment during twelve 
months. Patients were grouped as responders and non-responders according to 
their twelve-months change in MMSE. Normative values were created from 131 AD 
patients from ADNI, selecting 36 age- and MMSE-matched patients for interpreting 
the longitudinal changes in MMSE and brain atrophy. Results at baseline 
indicated that responders showed better clinical status and less pathological 
levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42. However, they showed more brain 
atrophy, and neuronal degeneration as evidenced by higher CSF levels of T-tau 
and neurofilaments. At follow-up, responders showed less brain shrinkage and 
better progression in the clinical variables and CSF biomarkers. Noteworthy, two 
responders showed less brain shrinkage than the normative ADNI group. These 
results together with previous evidence supports the idea that encapsulated 
biodelivery of NGF might have the potential to become a new treatment strategy 
for AD with both symptomatic and disease-modifying effects.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε 4 has been identified as the strongest 
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the importance of 
ApoE ε 4 on clinical and biological heterogeneity of AD is still to be 
determined, particularly at the prodromal stage. Here, we evaluate the 
association of ApoE ε 4 with clinical cognition and neuroimaging regions in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) participants based on the AT (N) system, which is 
increasingly essential for developing a precise assessment of AD.
METHODS: We stratified 178 A+T+MCI participants (prodromal AD) into ApoE ε 4 (+) 
and ApoE ε 4 (-) according to ApoE genotype from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We determined Aβ-positivity (A+) by the 
standardized uptake values ratios (SUVR) means of florbetapir-PET-AV45 (the 
cut-off value of 1.1) and fibrillar tau-positivity (T+) by cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) phosphorylated-tau at threonine 181 position (p-Tau) (cut-off value of 23 
pg/mL). We evaluated the effect of ApoE ε 4 status on cognitive conditions and 
brain atrophy from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A 
multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare the differences of 
cognitive scores and brain atrophy from structural MRI regions of interest 
(ROIs) between both groups. Furthermore, we performed a linear regression model 
to assess the correlation between signature ROIs of structural MRI and cognitive 
scores in the prodromal AD participants.
RESULTS: ApoE ε 4 (+) prodromal AD participants had lower levels of CSF Aβ 1-42, 
higher levels of t-Tau, more memory and global cognitive impairment, and faster 
decline of global cognition, compared to ApoE ε 4 (-) prodromal AD. ApoE ε 4 (+) 
prodromal AD participants had a thinner cortical thickness of bilateral 
entorhinal, smaller subcortical volume of the left amygdala, bilateral 
hippocampus, and left ventral diencephalon (DC) relative to ApoE ε 4 (-) 
prodromal AD. Furthermore, the cortical thickness average of bilateral 
entorhinal was highly correlated with memory and global cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: ApoE ε 4 status in prodromal AD participants has an important 
effect on clinical cognitive domains. After ascertaining the ApoE ε 4 status, 
specific MRI regions can be correlated to the cognitive domain and will be 
helpful for precise assessment in prodromal AD.

cerebral amyloid deposition, and disease progression. The genome-wide 
association study was performed via a meta-analysis of two non-overlapping 
discovery sample sets to identify genetic variants other than APOE ε4 predictive 
of the CSF biomarker level (Aβ1-42, t-Tau, p-Tau181P, t-Tau:Aβ1-42 ratio, and 
p-Tau181P:Aβ1-42 ratio) in patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Loci passing a genome-wide significance 
threshold of P < 5 x 10-8 were followed-up for replication in an independent 
sample set. We also performed joint meta-analysis of both discovery sample sets 
together with the replication sample set. In the discovery phase, we identified 
variants in FRA10AC1 associated with CSF Aβ1-42 level passing the genome-wide 
significance threshold (directly genotyped SNV rs10509663 PFE = 1.1 x 10-9, 
imputed SNV rs116953792 PFE = 3.5 x 10-10), rs116953792 (Pone-sided = 0.04) 
achieved replication. This association became stronger in the joint 
meta-analysis (directly genotyped SNV rs10509663 PFE = 1.7 x 10-9, imputed SNV 
rs116953792 PFE = 7.6 x 10-11). Additionally, we identified locus 15q21 (imputed 
SNV rs1503351 PFE = 4.0 x 10-8) associated with CSF Aβ1-42 level. No other 
variants passed the genome-wide significance threshold for other CSF biomarkers 
in either the discovery sample sets or joint analysis. Gene set enrichment 
analyses suggested that targeted genes mediated by miR-33, miR-146, and miR-193 
were enriched in various GWAS analyses. This finding is particularly important 
because CSF biomarkers confer disease susceptibility and may be predictive of 
the likelihood of disease progression in Alzheimer's Disease.

We evaluated the effect of the antidiabetic drug metformin on patients enrolled 
in the ADNI study considering patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Employing data from this observational study, we 
performed a principal component analysis focusing on the cognitive sphere by 
evaluating data from neuropsychological tests included in a modified version of 
the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive 
Composite (ADCS-PACC). Second, we included the levels of amyloid-β, tau, and 
phosphorylated tau in CSF. We found that MCI metformin-treated patients were 
globally characterized as subjects with a better cognitive performance and CSF 
biomarkers profile than the mean population of MCI patients. On the other hand, 
control subjects and type 2 diabetes patients (T2D) were paired by age, gender, 
ApoE allele, and years of education, defining three groups: MCI, MCI + T2D, and 
MCI + T2D + metformin. We evaluated the effect of T2D and metformin treatment 
employing the PACC score and composites defined from standardized ADNI variables 
to evaluate the memory and learning function. We found that MCI + T2D patients 
had a worse cognitive performance than MCI patients, but this deleterious effect 
was not observed in MCI + T2D + metformin patients. These cognitive variations 
were associated with changes in cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. 
Finally, no differences were found in metabolic plasmatic parameters (glycemia, 
cholesterol, triglycerides). Our study-employing different strategies for data 
analysis from the global study ADNI-shows a beneficial effect of metformin 
treatment on cognitive performance, CSF biomarkers profile, and neuroanatomical 
measures in MCI due to AD patients.

According to the latest Braak staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau pathology 
occurs earliest in the brain in the locus coeruleus (LC) of the brainstem, then 
propagates to the transentorhinal cortex (TEC), and later to other neocortical 
regions. Recent animal and in vivo human brain imaging research also support the 
trans-axonal propagation of tau pathology. In addition, neurochemical studies 
link norepinephrine to behavioral symptoms in AD. It is thus critical to examine 
the integrity of the LC-TEC pathway in studying the early development of the 
disease, but there has been limited work in this direction. By leveraging the 
high-resolution and multi-shell diffusion MRI data from the Human Connectome 
Project (HCP), in this work we develop a novel method for the reconstruction of 
the LC-TEC pathway in a cohort of 40 HCP subjects carefully selected based on 
rigorous quality control of the residual distortion artifacts in the brainstem. 
A probabilistic atlas of the LC-TEC pathway of both hemispheres is then 
developed in the MNI152 space and distributed publicly on the NITRC website. To 
apply our atlas on clinical imaging data, we develop an automated approach to 
calculate the medial core of the LC-TEC pathway for localized analysis of 
connectivity changes. In a cohort of 138 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we demonstrate the detection of the decreased 
fiber integrity in the LC-TEC pathways with increasing disease severity.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the complex connection between chronic sleep 
disturbance (CSD) and cognitive progression.
METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was 
used to assign 784 non-dementia elderly into two groups: a normal sleep group 
(528 participants) and a CSD group (256 participants) via the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory (NPI)-sleep subitem. Blood transcriptomics, blood neutrophil, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
neutrophil-related inflammatory factors were measured. We also investigated gene 
set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Cox proportional hazards model for risk factors, 
and mediation and interaction effects between indicators. Cognitive progression 
is defined as the progression from cognitively normal to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI)/dementia or from MCI to dementia.
RESULTS: CSD could significantly affect cognitive function. The activated 
neutrophil pathways for cognitive progression in CSD were identified by 
transcriptomics GSEA, which was reflected by increased blood neutrophil level 
and its correlation with cognitive progression in CSD. High tau burden mediated 
the influence of neutrophils on cognitive function and exacerbated the 
CSD-related risk of left hippocampal atrophy. Elevated neutrophil-related 
inflammatory factors were observed in the cognitive progression of CSD and were 
associated with brain tau burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Activated neutrophil pathway triggering tau pathology may underline 
the mechanism of cognitive progression in CSD.

BACKGROUND: Genetic research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has primarily focused 
on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathogenesis, with fewer studies exploring tau pathology. 
Elucidating the genetic basis of tau pathology could identify novel pathways in 
AD.
METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study of tau standard uptake 
value ratios (SUVRs) from [18]F-flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) 
images to identify genetic variants underlying Tau pathology. Genetic data and 
tau-SUVRs from [18]F-flortaucipir PET images were acquired from the A4 (311 with 
preclinical AD) and ADNI (280 cognitively normal, 76 with mild cognitive 
impairment, and 19 AD patients) studies. Circulating plasma proteins in UK 
Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBPPP, N=54,129) were used to validate 
genetic findings. SNP genotypes were tested for association with Tau-SUVR levels 
adjusting for age, sex and population substructure variables. AD association of 
polygenic risk scores (PRS) of tau and amyloid-SUVRs were assessed. Causal 
effect of plasma protein levels on Tau pathology were tested using Mendelian 
randomization analyses.
RESULTS: GWAS of tau-SUVR revealed two significant loci: rs78636169 
(P=5.76×10-10) in JARID2 and rs7292124 (P=2.20×10-8) near ISX. Gene-based 
analysis of tau deposition highlighted APOE (P=2.55×10-6), CTNNA3 (P=2.86×10-6) 
and JARID2 (P=1.23×10-4), a component of the PRC2 multi-protein complex which 
regulates gene expression. Mendelian randomization analysis of available 
circulating plasma proteins in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBPPP) 
identified LRRFIP1, a protein that binds with PRC2 multi-protein complex, as 
potentially causally linked to tau pathology. Genes associated with both amyloid 
and tau pathologies were enriched in endocytosis and signal transduction 
pathways. AD polygenic risk score (PRS) was associated with amyloid-SUVR but not 
with tau-SUVR. Amyloid-SUVR PRS had a notable association with AD clinical 
status, particularly in younger APOE-ε4 carriers, whereas tau-SUVR PRS showed a 
stronger association in older carriers.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel potential therapeutic target, JARID2 in the 
PRC2 multi-protein complex, for tau pathology. Furthermore, gene pathway 
analysis clarified the distinct roles of Aβ and tau in AD progression, 
underscoring the complexity of genetic influences across different stages of the 
disease.

Neuropathological studies have shown that the typical neurofibrillary pathology 
of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD) preferentially 
affects specific brain regions whereas others remain relatively spared. It has 
been suggested that the distinct regional distribution profile of tau pathology 
in AD may be a consequence of the intrinsic network structure of the human 
brain. The spatially distributed brain regions that are most affected by the 
spread of tau pathology may hence reflect an interconnected neuronal system. 
Here, we characterized the brain-wide regional distribution profile of tau 
pathology in AD using 18F-AV 1451 tau-sensitive positron emission tomography 
(PET) imaging, and studied this pattern in relation to the functional network 
organization of the human brain. Specifically, we quantified the spatial 
correspondence of the regional distribution pattern of PET-evidenced tau 
pathology in AD with functional brain networks characterized by large-scale 
resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data in healthy 
subjects. Regional distribution patterns of increased PET-evidenced tau 
pathology in AD compared to controls were characterized in two independent 
samples of prodromal and manifest AD cases (the Swedish BioFINDER study, n = 44; 
the ADNI study, n = 35). In the BioFINDER study we found that the typical AD tau 
pattern involved predominantly inferior, medial, and lateral temporal cortical 
areas, as well as the precuneus/posterior cingulate, and lateral parts of the 
parietal and occipital cortex. This pattern overlapped primarily with the dorsal 
attention, and to some extent with higher visual, limbic and parts of the 
default-mode network. PET-evidenced tau pathology in the ADNI replication 
sample, which represented a more prodromal group of AD cases, was less 
pronounced but showed a highly similar spatial distribution profile, suggesting 
an earlier-stage snapshot of a consistently progressing regional pattern. In 
conclusion, the present study indicates that the regional deposition of tau 
aggregates in AD predominantly affects higher-order cognitive over primary 
sensory-motor networks, but does not appear to be specific for the default-mode 
or related limbic networks.

Biomarkers, both biological and imaging, are indicators of specific changes that 
characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in vivo. Knowing the precise 
relationship between biomarkers and disease severity would allow for accurate 
disease staging and possible forecasting of decline. Jack et al. suggested as an 
initial hypothesis that this relationship be sigmoidal; the objective of this 
article is to determine, using large-scale population data from ADNI, the 
precise shape of this association. We considered six different models (linear; 
quadratic; robust quadratic; local quadratic regression; penalized B-spline; and 
sigmoid) and used the Akaike Information Criterion to gauge how well these 
models compare in conforming to the data. We included 576 subjects (229 
controls, 193 AD, and 154 mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to 
AD) from the ADNI study, for whom baseline data on cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 
(Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total-tau (t-tau), hippocampal volumes, 
and FDG-PET were available. Analysis of this cross-sectional dataset showed that 
a local quadratic regression model was 42% more likely than a sigmoid to be the 
best model for Aβ42. This ratio augments to 22% and 73% for Penalized B-Spline 
in the case of p-tau and t-tau, respectively; to 3500% for the linear model for 
FDG-PET; and to 6700% for the Penalized B-Spline for hippocampal volumes. 
Preliminary, cross-sectional evidence therefore indicates that the shape of the 
association with disease severity is non-linear and differs between biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: We examined networks of tau connectivity between brain regions 
based on correlations of their [18F]flortaucipir positron emission tomography 
(PET) uptake to evaluate sex-specific differences in brain-wide tau propagation.
METHODS: PET data of clinically normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used 
to examine differences in network architectures across the groups.
RESULTS: The tau-based network architecture resembled progression of tauopathy 
from Braak stage I to VI regions. Compared to men, women had higher network 
density and an increased number of direct regional connections in co-occurrence 
with increased brain-wide tau burden, particularly at MCI. Several regions, 
including superior parietal lobe and parahippocampus served as connecting 
bridges between communities at different Braak stages.
DISCUSSION: Network characteristics in women may favor an accelerated brain-wide 
tau spread leading to a higher tau burden in women than men with MCI with 
implications for the greater female preponderance in Alzheimer's disease 
diagnosis.

Although genome-wide association studies have identified multiple Alzheimer's 
disease (AD)-associated loci by selecting the main effects of individual 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the interpretation of genetic variance 
in AD is limited. Based on the linear regression method, we performed 
genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 to identify 
potential genetic epistasis implicated in AD, with age, gender, and diagnosis as 
covariates. A GPU-based method was used to address the computational challenges 
posed by the analysis of epistasis. We found 368 SNP pairs to be statistically 
significant, and highly significant SNP-SNP interactions were identified between 
the marginal main effects of SNP pairs, which explained a relatively high 
variance at the Aβ42 level. Our results replicated 100 previously reported 
AD-related genes and 5 gene-gene interaction pairs of the protein-protein 
interaction network. Our bioinformatics analyses provided preliminary evidence 
that the 5-overlapping gene-gene interaction pairs play critical roles in 
inducing synaptic loss and dysfunction, thereby leading to memory decline and 
cognitive impairment in AD-affected brains.

Stereotypical isocortical tau protein pathology along the Braak stages has been 
described as an instigator of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Less is known about tau pathology in motor regions, although higher-order motor 
deficits such as praxis dysfunction are part of the clinical description. Here, 
we examined how tau pathology in cytoarchitectonically mapped regions of the 
primary and higher-order motor network in comparison to primary visual and 
sensory regions varies across the clinical spectrum of AD. We analyzed tau PET 
scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 84) and dementia of the 
Alzheimer's disease type (DAD; N = 25). Additionally, an amyloid-negative sample 
of healthy older individuals (HC; N = 26) were included. Standard uptake ratio 
values (SUVRs) were extracted in native space from the left and the right 
hemispheres. A repeated measurement analysis of variance was conducted to assess 
the effect of diagnostic disease category on tau pathology in the individual 
motor regions, controlling for age. We observed that tau pathology varies as a 
function of diagnostic category in predominantly higher motor regions (i.e., 
supplementary motor area, superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, and dorsal 
premotor cortex) compared to primary visual, sensory and motor regions. Indeed, 
tau in higher-order motor regions was significantly associated with decline in 
cognitive function. Together, these results expand our knowledge on the in vivo 
pattern of tau pathology in AD and suggest that higher motor regions are not 
spared from tau aggregation in the course of disease, potentially contributing 
to the symptomatic appearance of the disease.

Machine learning methods pool diverse information to perform computer-assisted 
diagnosis and predict future clinical decline. We introduce a machine learning 
method to boost power in clinical trials. We created a Support Vector Machine 
algorithm that combines brain imaging and other biomarkers to classify 737 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) subjects as having 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal controls. 
We trained our classifiers based on example data including: MRI measures of 
hippocampal, ventricular, and temporal lobe volumes, a PET-FDG numerical 
summary, CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau, and Abeta(42)), ApoE genotype, age, sex, 
and body mass index. MRI measures contributed most to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
classification; PET-FDG and CSF biomarkers, particularly Abeta(42), contributed 
more to MCI classification. Using all biomarkers jointly, we used our classifier 
to select the one-third of the subjects most likely to decline. In this 
subsample, fewer than 40 AD and MCI subjects would be needed to detect a 25% 
slowing in temporal lobe atrophy rates with 80% power--a substantial boosting of 
power relative to standard imaging measures.

It is an open issue whether blood biomarkers serve to diagnose Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) or monitor its progression over time from prodromal stages. Here, 
we addressed this question starting from data of the European FP7 
IMI-PharmaCog/E-ADNI longitudinal study in amnesic mild cognitive impairment 
(aMCI) patients including biological, clinical, neuropsychological (e.g., 
ADAS-Cog13), neuroimaging, and electroencephalographic measures. 
PharmaCog/E-ADNI patients were classified as "positive" (i.e., "prodromal AD" n 
= 76) or "negative" (n = 52) based on a diagnostic cut-off of Aβ42/P-tau in 
cerebrospinal fluid as well as APOE ε 4 genotype. Blood was sampled at baseline 
and at two follow-ups (12 and 18 months), when plasma amyloid peptide 42 and 40 
(Aβ42, Aβ40) and apolipoprotein J (clusterin, CLU) were assessed. Linear Mixed 
Models found no significant differences in plasma molecules between the 
"positive" (i.e., prodromal AD) and "negative" groups at baseline. In contrast, 
plasma Aβ42 showed a greater reduction over time in the prodromal AD than the 
"negative" aMCI group (p = 0.048), while CLU and Aβ40 increased, but similarly 
in the two groups. Furthermore, plasma Aβ42 correlated with the ADAS-Cog13 score 
both in aMCI patients as a whole and the prodromal AD group alone. Finally, CLU 
correlated with the ADAS-Cog13 only in the whole aMCI group, and no association 
with ADAS-Cog13 was found for Aβ40. In conclusion, plasma Aβ42 showed disease 
progression-related features in aMCI patients with prodromal AD.

Biomarkers are the only feasible way to detect and monitor presymptomatic 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). No single biomarker can predict future cognitive 
decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful 
multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of 
disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here 
we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for 
differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD 
subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 
95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. 
We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of 
hippocampal volume and CSF Aβ, t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in 
combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. 
We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model 
would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three 
diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy 
and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed 
better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC 
from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. 
AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not 
for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination 
of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion 
performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex 
achieved AUC = 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while 
CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUC = 0.89 for predicting conversion in 
ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory 
in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the 
disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the 
disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible 
for some of the observed disease heterogeneity.

The 2018 NIA-AA research framework proposes a classification system with 
Amyloid-β deposition, pathologic Tau, and Neurodegeneration (ATN) for diagnosis 
and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database can be utilized to identify diagnostic 
signatures for predicting AD progression, and to determine the utility of this 
NIA-AA research framework. Profiles of 320 peptides from baseline cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) samples of 287 normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD 
subjects followed over a 3-10-year period were measured via multiple reaction 
monitoring mass spectrometry. CSF Aβ42, total-Tau (tTau), phosphorylated-Tau 
(pTau-181), and hippocampal volume were also measured. From these candidate 
markers, optimal signatures with decision thresholds to separate AD and normal 
subjects were first identified via unbiased regression and tree-based 
algorithms. The best performing signature determined via cross-validation was 
then tested in an independent group of MCI subjects to predict future 
progression. This multivariate analysis yielded a simple diagnostic signature 
comprising CSF pTau-181 to Aβ42 ratio, MRI hippocampal volume, and low CSF 
levels of a novel PTPRN peptide, with a decision threshold on each marker. When 
applied to a separate MCI group at baseline, subjects meeting these signature 
criteria experience 4.3-fold faster progression to AD compared to a 2.2-fold 
faster progression using only conventional markers. This novel 4-marker 
signature represents an advance over the current diagnostics based on widely 
used markers, and is easier to use in practice than recently published complex 
signatures. This signature also reinforces the ATN construct from the 2018 
NIA-AA research framework.

Epidemiological studies show mixed findings for serum vitamin B12 (B12) and both 
cognitive and regional volume outcomes. No studies to date have comprehensively 
examined, in non-supplemented individuals, serum B12 level associations with 
neurodegeneration, hypometabolism and cognition across the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) spectrum. Serum B12 was assayed from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship 
Study of Ageing (AIBL). Voxel-wise analyses regressed B12 levels against 
regional grey matter (GM) volume and glucose metabolism (P < 0·05, family-wise 
corrected). For ADNI GM, there were thirty-nine cognitively normal (CN), 
seventy-three mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and thirty-one AD participants. 
For AIBL GM, there were 311 CN, fifty-nine MCI and thirty-one AD participants. 
Covariates were age, sex, baseline diagnosis, APOE4 status and BMI. In ADNI, 
higher B12 was negatively associated with GM in the right precuneus and 
bilateral frontal gyri. When diagnostic groups were examined separately, only 
participants with MCI, or above an established cut-off for cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) total tau showed such associations. In AIBL, higher B12 was associated 
with more GM in the right amygdala and right superior temporal pole, which 
largely seemed to be driven by CN participants that constituted most of the 
sample. Our results suggest that B12 may show different patterns of association 
based on clinical status and, for ADNI, AD CSF biomarkers. Accounting for these 
factors may clarify the relationship between B12 with neural outcomes in 
late-life.

BACKGROUND: To alleviate the interpretation of the core Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid β1-42 (Aβ42), total tau (T-tau), 
and phosphorylated tau (P-tau), the Erlangen Score (ES) interpretation algorithm 
has been proposed.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to assess the predictive properties of the ES 
algorithm on cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI).
METHODS: All MCI subjects with an available baseline CSF sample from ADNI-1 were 
included (n = 193), and assigned an ES between 0 and 4 based on their baseline 
CSF biomarker profile. Structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans and 
MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores were collected at up to 7 times in follow-up 
examinations.
RESULTS: We observed strong and significant correlations between the ES at 
baseline and neuroimaging and cognitive results with patients with 
neurochemically probable AD (ES = 4) progressing significantly (p≤0.01) faster 
than those with a neurochemically improbable AD (ES = 0 or 1), and the subjects 
with neurochemically possible AD (ES = 2 or 3) in-between these two groups.
CONCLUSION: This study further demonstrates the utility of the ES algorithm as a 
as a tool in predicting cognitive and imaging progression in MCI patients.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid, Tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers can stage 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Synaptic biomarkers may help track cognition.
METHODS: In cognitively normal controls, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD, 
we investigated CSF biomarkers in relation to cognitive measures and as 
predictors of cognitive and global decline.
RESULTS: There were 90 normal controls (mean age 73.0, 58% women), 57 MCI (mean 
age 74.3, 35% women), and 46 AD (mean age 70.7, 41% women). CSF Aβ1-42 and 
Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) were decreased, and CSF Tau, neurogranin, and 
SNAP25 increased in AD versus controls. Aβ1-42/Tau or NPTX2/Tau discriminated AD 
and controls best. NPTX2/Tau correlated strongly with cognition in AD and MCI 
and predicted a 2-3-year decline. We replicated findings in the ADNI cohort.
DISCUSSION: CSF synaptic biomarkers, particularly NPTX2, which regulates 
synaptic homeostasis, relate to cognition and predict progression in AD beyond 
Aβ1-42 and Tau. This is relevant for prognosis and clinical trials.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) database is an expansive undertaking 
by government, academia, and industry to pool resources and data on subjects at 
various stage of symptomatic severity due to Alzheimer's disease. As expected, 
magnetic resonance imaging is a major component of the project. Full brain 
images are obtained at every 6-month visit. A range of cognitive tests studying 
executive function and memory are employed less frequently. Two blood draws 
(baseline, 6 months) provide samples to measure concentrations of approximately 
145 plasma biomarkers. In addition, other diagnostic measurements are performed 
including PET imaging, cerebral spinal fluid measurements of amyloid-beta and 
tau peptides, as well as genetic tests, demographics, and vital signs. ADNI data 
is available upon review of an application. There have been numerous reports of 
how various processes evolve during AD progression, including alterations in 
metabolic and neuroendocrine activity, cell survival, and cognitive behavior. 
Lacking an analytic model at the onset, we leveraged recent advances in machine 
learning, which allow us to deal with large, non-linear systems with many 
variables. Of particular note was examining how well binary predictions of 
future disease states could be learned from simple, non-invasive measurements 
like those dependent on blood samples. Such measurements make relatively little 
demands on the time and effort of medical staff or patient. We report findings 
with recall/precision/area under the receiver operator curve after application 
of CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, Our 
results show (i) Random Forests and Gradient Boosting work very well with such 
data, (ii) Prediction quality when applied to relatively easily obtained 
measurements (Cognitive scores, Genetic Risk and plasma biomarkers) achieve 
results that are competitive with magnetic resonance techniques. This is by no 
means an exhaustive study, but instead an exploration of the plausibility of 
defining a series of relatively inexpensive, broad population based tests.

BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene encoding 
the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1, rs1868402) and the 
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883) gene were recently 
associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels in samples from the 
Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (WU) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In these same samples, these 
SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of 
boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an 
independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County 
Dementia Progression Study (DPS).
METHODS: All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb ≤1 (mild) at initial 
clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other 
time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and 
rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these 
SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS.
RESULTS: Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 
alone and change in CDR-sb (P > .10), there was a significant association 
between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the 
high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed >2.9 times faster than noncarriers 
(P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from 
WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk 
allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both 
loci progressed 6 times faster (P < .0001) than all others combined.
CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific 
variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated 
progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a 
better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of 
AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic 
strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common cause of 
dementia in older adults. We tested the variability in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
proteins associated with previously identified HS-Aging risk single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs).
METHODS: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI; n=237) data, 
combining both multiplexed proteomics CSF and genotype data, were used to assess 
the association between CSF analytes and risk SNPs in four genes (SNPs): GRN 
(rs5848), TMEM106B (rs1990622), ABCC9 (rs704180), and KCNMB2 (rs9637454). For 
controls, non-HS-Aging SNPs in APOE (rs429358/rs7412) and MAPT (rs8070723) were 
also analyzed against Aβ1-42 and total tau CSF analytes.
RESULTS: The GRN risk SNP (rs5848) status correlated with variation in CSF 
proteins, with the risk allele (T) associated with increased levels of AXL 
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (AXL), TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Receptor 3 
(TRAIL-R3), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and clusterin (CLU) (all 
p<0.05 after Bonferroni correction). The TRAIL-R3 correlation was significant in 
meta-analysis with an additional dataset (p=5.05×10-5). Further, the rs5848 SNP 
status was associated with increased CSF tau protein - a marker of 
neurodegeneration (p=0.015). These data are remarkable since this GRN SNP has 
been found to be a risk factor for multiple types of dementia-related brain 
pathologies.

Previous research has emphasized the unique impact of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
pathology on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a reflection that tau pathology is 
particularly striking in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortex (ERC, TEC) 
early in the course of disease. However, other brain regions are affected by AD 
pathology during its early phases. Here, we use longitudinal diffeomorphometry 
to measure the atrophy rate from MRI of the amygdala compared with that in the 
ERC and TEC in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls, CU individuals who 
progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with MCI who 
progressed to dementia of the AD type (DAT), using a dataset from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results show 
significantly higher atrophy rates of the amygdala in both groups of 
'converters' (CU→MCI, MCI→DAT) compared to controls, with rates of volume loss 
comparable to rates of thickness loss in the ERC and TEC. We localize atrophy 
within the amygdala within each of these groups using fixed effects modeling. 
Controlling for the familywise error rate highlights the medial regions of the 
amygdala as those with significantly higher atrophy in both groups of converters 
than in controls. Using our recently developed method, referred to as Projective 
LDDMM, we map measures of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) from digital 
pathology to MRI atlases and reconstruct dense 3D spatial distributions of NFT 
density within regions of the MTL. The distribution of NFTs is consistent with 
the spatial distribution of MR measured atrophy rates, revealing high densities 
(and atrophy) in the amygdala (particularly medial), ERC, and rostral third of 
the MTL. The similarity of the location of NFTs in AD and shape changes in a 
well-defined clinical population suggests that amygdalar atrophy rate, as 
measured through MRI may be a viable biomarker for AD.

β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) plays an important 
role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), freeing the amyloid-β (Aβ) 
N-terminus from the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), the first step in Aβ 
formation. Increased BACE1 activity in AD brain or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has 
been reported. Other studies, however, found either no change or a decrease with 
AD diagnosis in either BACE1 activity or sAβPPβ, the N-terminal secreted product 
of BACE1 (sBACE1) activity on AβPP. Here, sBACE1 enzymatic activity and secreted 
AβPPβ (sAβPPβ) were measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 
(ADNI-1) baseline CSF samples and no statistically significant changes were 
found in either measure comparing healthy control, mild cognitively impaired, or 
AD individual samples. While CSF sBACE1 activity and sAβPPβ demonstrated a 
moderate yet significant degree of correlation with each other, there was no 
correlation of either analyte to CSF Aβ peptide ending at residue 42. 
Surprisingly, a stronger correlation was demonstrated between CSF sBACE1 
activity and tau, which was comparable to that between CSF Aβ₄₂ and tau. Unlike 
for these latter two analytes, receiver-operator characteristic curves 
demonstrate that neither CSF sBACE1 activity nor sAβPPβ concentrations can be 
used to differentiate between healthy elderly and AD individuals.

Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and structural imaging markers are suggested as 
biomarkers amended to existing diagnostic criteria of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). But there is no clear instruction on which 
markers should be used at which stage of dementia. This study aimed to first 
investigate associations of the CSF markers as well as volumes and shapes of the 
hippocampus and lateral ventricles with MCI and AD at the baseline and secondly 
apply these baseline markers to predict MCI conversion in a two-year time using 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results 
suggested that the CSF markers, including Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau, distinguished 
MCI or AD from NC, while the Aβ42 CSF marker contributed to the differentiation 
between MCI and AD. The hippocampal shapes performed better than the hippocampal 
volumes in classifying NC and MCI, NC and AD, as well as MCI and AD. 
Interestingly, the ventricular volumes were better than the ventricular shapes 
to distinguish MCI or AD from NC, while the ventricular shapes showed better 
accuracy than the ventricular volumes in classifying MCI and AD. As the CSF 
markers and the structural markers are complementary, the combination of them 
showed great improvements in the classification accuracies of MCI and AD. 
Moreover, the combination of these markers showed high sensitivity but low 
specificity for predicting conversion from MCI to AD in two years. Hence, it is 
feasible to employ a cross-sectional sample to investigate dynamic associations 
of the CSF and imaging markers with MCI and AD and to predict future MCI 
conversion. In particular, the volumetric information may be good for the early 
stage of AD, while morphological shapes should be considered as markers in the 
prediction of MCI conversion to AD together with the CSF markers.

Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of tau and amyloid beta42 suggest 
possible active underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) including neurometabolic 
dysfunction and neurodegeneration leading to eventual cognitive decline. But the 
temporal relationship between CSF, imaging markers of neural function, and 
cognition has not been described. Using a statistical mediation model, we 
examined relationships between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes 
(hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau(181p)), β-amyloid peptides 1-42 (Aβ(1-42)), 
total tau (t-Tau), and their ratios); change in cognitive function; and change 
in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake using positron emission tomography 
(PET). We hypothesized that a) abnormal CSF protein values at baseline, result 
in cognitive declines by decreasing neuronal glucose metabolism across time, and 
b) the role of altered glucose metabolism in the assumed causal chain varies by 
brain region and the nature of CSF protein alteration. Data from 412 individuals 
participating in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) cohort studies were 
included in analyses. At baseline, individuals were cognitively normal (N = 82), 
or impaired: 241 with mild cognitive impairment, and 89 with Alzheimer's 
disease. A parallel-process latent growth curve model was used to test 
mediational effects of changes in regional FDG-PET uptake over time in relation 
to baseline CSF biomarkers and changes in cognition, measured with the 13-item 
Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Findings 
suggested a causal sequence of events; specifically, FDG hypometabolism acted as 
a mediator between antecedent CSF biomarker alterations and subsequent cognitive 
impairment. Higher baseline concentrations of t-Tau, and p-Tau(181p) were more 
predictive of decline in cerebral glucose metabolism than lower baseline 
concentrations of Aβ(1-42). FDG-PET changes appeared to mediate t-Tau or 
t-Tau/Aβ(1-42)-associated cognitive change across all brain regions examined. 
Significant direct effects of alterations in Aβ(1-42) levels on hypometabolism 
were observed in a single brain region: middle/inferior temporal gyrus. Results 
support a temporal framework model in which reduced CSF amyloid-related 
biomarkers occur earlier in the pathogenic pathway, ultimately leading to 
detrimental cognitive effects. Also consistent with this temporal framework 
model, baseline markers of neurofibrillary degeneration predicted changes in 
brain glucose metabolism in turn causing longitudinal cognitive changes, 
suggesting that tau-related burden precedes neurometabolic dysfunction. While 
intriguing, the hypothesized mediational relationships require further 
validation.

Different inflammatory and metabolic pathways have been associated with 
Alzheimeŕs disease (AD). However, only recently multi-analyte panels to study a 
large number of molecules in well characterized cohorts have been made 
available. These panels could help identify molecules that point to the affected 
pathways. We studied the relationship between a panel of plasma biomarkers 
(Human DiscoveryMAP) and presence of AD-like brain atrophy patterns defined by a 
previously published index (SPARE-AD) at baseline in subjects of the ADNI 
cohort. 818 subjects had MRI-derived SPARE-AD scores, of these subjects 69% had 
plasma biomarkers and 51% had CSF tau and Aβ measurements. Significant 
analyte-SPARE-AD and analytes correlations were studied in adjusted models. 
Plasma cortisol and chromogranin A showed a significant association that did not 
remain significant in the CSF signature adjusted model. Plasma macrophage 
inhibitory protein-1α and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 showed a 
significant association with brain atrophy in the adjusted model. Cortisol 
levels showed an inverse association with tests measuring processing speed. Our 
results indicate that stress and insulin responses and cytokines associated with 
recruitment of inflammatory cells in MCI-AD are associated with its 
characteristic AD-like brain atrophy pattern and correlate with clinical changes 
or CSF biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of tau 
and amyloid in the brain. Although the core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD 
biomarkers amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ1-42), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated 
tau 181 (p-tau181) show good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, additional 
biomarkers that can aid in preclinical diagnosis or better track disease 
progression are needed. Activation of the complement system, a pivotal part of 
inflammation, occurs at very early stages in the AD brain. Therefore, CSF levels 
of complement proteins that could be linked to cognitive and structural changes 
in AD may have diagnostic and prognostic value.
METHODS: Using xMAP® technology based assays we measured complement 3 (C3) and 
factor H (FH) in the CSF of 110 controls (CN), 187 mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and 92 AD subjects of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) at baseline. 
All ADNI participants underwent clinical follow-up at 12 month intervals and MCI 
subjects had additional visits at 6 and 18 months. The association between CSF 
biomarkers and different outcome measures were analyzed using Cox proportional 
hazard models (conversion from MCI to AD), logistic regression models 
(classification of clinical groups) and mixed-effects models adjusted for age, 
gender, education, t-tau/Aβ1-42 and APOE ϵ4 presence (baseline and longitudinal 
association between biomarkers and cognitive scores).
RESULTS: Although no association was found between the complement proteins and 
clinical diagnosis or cognitive measures, lower levels of C3 (β = -0.12, 
p = 0.041) and FH (β = -0.075, p = 0.041) were associated with faster cognitive 
decline in MCI subjects as measured by the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive 
subscale (ADAS-Cog) test. Furthermore, lower FH levels were associated with 
larger lateral ventricular volume (p = 0.024), which is indicative of brain 
atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms a lack of suitability of CSF C3 and FH as 
diagnostic biomarkers of AD, but points to their modest potential as prognostic 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cognitively impaired patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental benefit of biomarkers for 
prediction of Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) when added stepwise in the order of their collection in 
clinical routine. The model started with cognitive status characterized by the 
ADAS-13 score. Hippocampus volume (HV), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau 
(pTau), and the FDG t-sum score in an AD meta-region-of-interest were compared 
as neurodegeneration markers. CSF-Aβ1-42 was used as amyloidosis marker. The 
incremental prognostic benefit from these markers was assessed by stepwise 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in 402 ADNI MCI subjects. Predefined cutoffs were 
used to dichotomize patients as 'negative' or 'positive' for AD characteristic 
alteration with respect to each marker. Among the neurodegeneration markers, 
CSF-pTau provided the best incremental risk stratification when added to 
ADAS-13. FDG PET outperformed HV only in MCI subjects with relatively preserved 
cognition. Adding CSF-Aβ provided further risk stratification in pTau-positive 
subjects, independent of their cognitive status. Stepwise integration of 
biomarkers allows stepwise refinement of risk estimates for MCI-to-ADD 
progression. Incremental benefit strongly depends on the patient's status 
according to the preceding diagnostic steps. The stepwise Kaplan-Meier curves 
might be useful to optimize diagnostic workflow in individual patients.

The strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 
Apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (ApoE ε4). The interaction between sex and ApoE 
ε4 carrier status on AD risk remains an area of intense investigation. We 
hypothesized that sex modulates the relationship between ApoE ε4 carrier status 
and brain tau deposition (a quantitative endophenotype in AD) in individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Preprocessed 18F-AV-1451 tau and 
18F-AV-45 amyloid PET images, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans, demographic information, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau 
(t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements from 108 MCI subjects in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were included. After 
downloading pre-processed images from ADNI, an iterative reblurred Van 
Cittertiteration partial volume correction (PVC) method was applied to all PET 
images. MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) 
were defined in standard space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) 
images relative to cerebellum were computed. ApoE ε4 by sex interaction analyses 
on 18F-AV-1451 and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) were assessed using generalized linear 
models. The association between 18F-AV-1451 SUVR and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) was 
assessed. Results: After applying PVC and controlling for age, education level 
and global cortical 18F-AV-45 SUVR, we found that the entorhinal cortex, 
amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and occipital ROIs 
exhibited a significant ApoE ε4 by sex interaction effect (false discovery rate 
P < 0.1) among MCI individuals. We also found a significant ApoE ε4 by sex 
interaction effect on CSF t-tau and p-tau. 18F-AV-1451 SUVR in the 5 ROIs with 
ApoE ε4 by sex interaction was significantly correlated with CSF p-tau and 
t-tau. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that women are more susceptible to ApoE 
ε4-associated accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in MCI compared to males. 
Both CSF tau (p-tau, t-tau) and brain tau PET are robust quantitative biomarkers 
for studying ApoE ε4 by sex effects on brain tau deposition in MCI participants.

Hippocampal injury in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process is 
region-specific and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures of localized 
hippocampus (HP) atrophy are known to detect region-specific changes associated 
with clinical AD, but it is unclear whether these measures provide information 
that is independent of that already provided by measures of total HP volume. 
Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association between localized HP 
atrophy measures and AD-related measures including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
amyloid beta and tau concentrations, and cognitive performance, in statistical 
models that also included total HP volume as a covariate. A computational 
technique termed localized components analysis (LoCA) was used to identify 7 
independent patterns of HP atrophy among 390 semiautomatically delineated HP 
from baseline magnetic resonance imaging of participants in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Among cognitively normal participants, 
multiple measures of localized HP atrophy were significantly associated with CSF 
amyloid concentration, while total HP volume was not. In addition, among all 
participants, localized HP atrophy measures and total HP volume were both 
independently and additively associated with CSF tau concentration, performance 
on numerous neuropsychological tests, and discrimination between normal, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD clinical diagnostic groups. Together, these 
results suggest that regional measures of hippocampal atrophy provided by 
localized components analysis may be more sensitive than total HP volume to the 
effects of AD pathology burden among cognitively normal individuals and may 
provide information about HP regions whose deficits may have especially profound 
cognitive consequences throughout the AD clinical course.

The suggested revision of the NINCDS-ADRDA criterion for the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes at least one abnormal biomarker among magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF). We aimed to investigate if the combination of baseline MRI and CSF 
could enhance the classification of AD compared to using either alone and 
predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion at multiple future time 
points. 369 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
were included in the study (AD=96, MCI=162 and CTL=111). Freesurfer was used to 
generate regional subcortical volumes and cortical thickness measures. A total 
of 60 variables were used for orthogonal partial least squares to latent 
structures (OPLS) multivariate analysis (57 MRI measures and 3 CSF measures: 
Aβ(42), t-tau and p-tau). Combining MRI and CSF gave the best results for 
distinguishing AD vs. CTL. We found an accuracy of 91.8% for the combined model 
at baseline compared to 81.6% for CSF measures and 87.0% for MRI measures alone. 
The combined model also gave the best accuracy when distinguishing between MCI 
vs. CTL (77.6%) at baseline. MCI subjects who converted to AD by 12 and 18month 
follow-up were accurately predicted at baseline using an AD vs. CTL model (82.9% 
and 86.4% respectively), with lower prediction accuracies for those MCI subjects 
converting by 24 and 36month follow up (75.4% and 68.0% respectively). The 
overall prediction accuracies for converters and non-converters ranged from 
58.6% to 66.4% at different time points. Combining MRI and CSF measures in a 
multivariate model at baseline gave better accuracy for discriminating between 
AD and CTL, between MCI and CTL and for predicting future conversion from MCI to 
AD, than using either MRI or CSF separately.

BACKGROUND: Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection using cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers has been recommended as enrichment strategy for trials 
involving mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients.
OBJECTIVE: To model a prodromal AD trial for identifying MRI structural 
biomarkers to improve subject selection and to be used as surrogate outcomes of 
disease progression.
METHODS: APOE ɛ4 specific CSF Aβ42/P-tau cut-offs were used to identify MCI with 
prodromal AD (Aβ42/P-tau positive) in the WP5-PharmaCog (E-ADNI) cohort. Linear 
mixed models were performed 1) with baseline structural biomarker, time, and 
biomarker×time interaction as factors to predict longitudinal changes in 
ADAS-cog13, 2) with Aβ42/P-tau status, time, and Aβ42/P-tau status×time 
interaction as factors to explain the longitudinal changes in MRI measures, and 
3) to compute sample size estimation for a trial implemented with the selected 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: Only baseline lateral ventricle volume was able to identify a subgroup 
of prodromal AD patients who declined faster (interaction, p = 0.003). Lateral 
ventricle volume and medial temporal lobe measures were the biomarkers most 
sensitive to disease progression (interaction, p≤0.042). Enrichment through 
ventricular volume reduced the sample size that a clinical trial would require 
from 13 to 76%, depending on structural outcome variable. The biomarker needing 
the lowest sample size was the hippocampal subfield GC-ML-DG (granule cells of 
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) (n = 82 per arm to demonstrate a 20% 
atrophy reduction).
CONCLUSION: MRI structural biomarkers can enrich prodromal AD with fast 
progressors and significantly decrease group size in clinical trials of disease 
modifying drugs.

Ephrin type-A receptor 1 (EPHA1) (11771145) was documented to be one of the most 
strongly associated locus with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a recent 
meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies. However, its contribution 
to the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear to date. Here, we addressed the role 
of EPHA1 in AD by investigating the influence of EPHA1 on cerebrospinal fluid 
and neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical stages from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We did not detect significant 
association of EPHA1 with amyloid-β deposition or tau protein. However, the 
A-allele in the mild cognitive impairment group remarkably prevented hippocampal 
atrophy (partial correlation coefficient 2.812, 95% CI 0.651 to 4.973) at 
two-year follow-up. Additionally, AD subjects with the A-allele displayed less 
atrophy and greater cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in the right 
lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation coefficient 540.10, 
95% CI 247.26 to 832.95; CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.056, 95% CI 
0.024 to 0.087) and inferior temporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation 
coefficient 327.98, 95% CI 11.65 to 644.31; CMRgl: partial correlation 
coefficient 0.055, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.091) at baseline. This study suggests EPHA1 
(rs11771145) interferes with the pathological alteration of the hippocampus and 
the lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri throughout the AD 
process, leading to a lower risk of AD. However, the limited sample size and 
follow-up as well as the diversity across ethnicities precluded explanation of 
these findings.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau proteins are considered as critical factors 
that affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Although many studies have conducted on these two proteins, little study has 
investigated the relationship between their spatial distributions. This study 
aims to explore the associations of spatial patterns between Aβ deposition and 
tau deposition in patients with MCI and normal control (NC).
METHODS: We used multimodality positron emission tomography (PET) data from a 
clinically heterogeneous population of patients with MCI and NC. All data were 
obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
containing information of 65 patients with MCI and 75 NC who both had undergone 
AV45 (Aβ) and AV1451 (tau) PET. To assess the spatial distribution of Aβ and tau 
deposition, we employed parallel independent component analysis (pICA), which 
enabled the joint analysis of multimodal imaging data. pICA was conducted to 
identify the significant difference and correlation relationship of brain 
networks between Aβ PET and tau PET in MCI and NC groups.
RESULTS: Our results revealed the strongly correlated network between Aβ PET and 
tau PET were colocalized with the default-mode network (DMN). Simultaneously, in 
comparison of the spatial distribution between Aβ PET and tau PET, it was found 
that the significant differences between MCI and NC were mainly distributed in 
DMN, cognitive control network and visual networks. The altered brain networks 
obtained from pICA analysis are consistent with the abnormalities of brain 
network in MCI patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested the abnormal spatial distribution regions of tau 
PET were correlated with the abnormal spatial distribution regions of Aβ PET, 
and both of which were located in DMN network. This study revealed that 
combining pICA with multimodal imaging data is an effective approach for 
distinguishing MCI patients from NC group.

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid plaques are hallmark neuropathological 
features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is some debate as to which 
neuropathological feature comes first in the disease process, with early autopsy 
studies suggesting that NFT develop first, and more recent neuroimaging studies 
supporting the early role of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers of Aβ₄₂ and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been shown to 
serve as in vivo proxy measures of amyloid plaques and NFT, respectively. The 
aim of this study was to examine the association between CSF biomarkers and rate 
of atrophy in the precuneus and hippocampus. These regions were selected because 
the precuneus appears to be affected early and severely by Aβ deposition, and 
the hippocampus similarly by NFT pathology. We predicted (1) baseline Aβ₄₂ would 
be related to accelerated rate of cortical thinning in the precuneus and volume 
loss in the hippocampus, with the latter relationship expected to be weaker, (2) 
baseline p-tau(181p) would be related to accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy 
and cortical thinning in the precuneus, with the latter relationship expected to 
be weaker. Using all ADNI cohorts, we fitted separate linear mixed-effects 
models for changes in hippocampus and precuneus longitudinal outcome measures 
with baseline CSF biomarkers modeled as predictors. Results partially supported 
our hypotheses: Both baseline p-tau(181p) and Aβ₄₂ were associated with 
hippocampal atrophy over time. Neither p-tau(181p) nor Aβ₄₂ were significantly 
related to cortical thinning in the precuneus over time. However, follow-up 
analyses demonstrated that having abnormal levels of both Aβ₄₂ and p-tau(181p) 
was associated with an accelerated rate of atrophy in both the hippocampus and 
precuneus. Results support early effects of Aβ in the Alzheimer's disease 
process, which are less apparent than and perhaps dependent on p-tau effects as 
the disease progresses. However, amyloid deposition alone may be insufficient 
for emergence of significant morphometric changes and clinical symptoms.

BACKGROUND: In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the validation of 
biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and for use as a surrogate outcome in AD 
clinical trials is of considerable research interest.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical profile and genetic, neuroimaging and 
neurophysiological biomarkers of prodromal AD in amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI) patients enrolled in the IMI WP5 PharmaCog (also referred to 
as the European ADNI study).
METHODS: A total of 147 aMCI patients were enrolled in 13 European memory 
clinics. Patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and lumbar puncture to 
assess the levels of amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ42), tau and p-tau, and blood 
samples were collected. Genetic (APOE), neuroimaging (3T morphometry and 
diffusion MRI) and EEG (with resting-state and auditory oddball event-related 
potential (AO-ERP) paradigm) biomarkers were evaluated.
RESULTS: Prodromal AD was found in 55 aMCI patients defined by low Aβ42 in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (Aβ positive). Compared to the aMCI group with high Aβ42 
levels (Aβ negative), Aβ positive patients showed poorer visual (P = 0.001), 
spatial recognition (P < 0.0005) and working (P = 0.024) memory, as well as a 
higher frequency of APOE4 (P < 0.0005), lower hippocampal volume (P = 0.04), 
reduced thickness of the parietal cortex (P < 0.009) and structural connectivity 
of the corpus callosum (P < 0.05), higher amplitude of delta rhythms at rest (P 
= 0.03) and lower amplitude of posterior cingulate sources of AO-ERP (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, in aMCI patients, prodromal AD is 
characterized by a distinctive cognitive profile and genetic, neuroimaging and 
neurophysiological biomarkers. Longitudinal assessment will help to identify the 
role of these biomarkers in AD progression.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different biomarkers for AD may potentially be 
complementary in diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Our aim was to combine MR 
imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers in the diagnostic classification and 2-year 
prognosis of MCI and AD, by examining the following: 1) which measures are most 
sensitive to diagnostic status, 2) to what extent the methods provide unique 
information in diagnostic classification, and 3) which measures are most 
predictive of clinical decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADNI baseline MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 42 
controls, 73 patients with MCI, and 38 patients with AD; and 2-year clinical 
follow-up data for 36 controls, 51 patients with MCI, and 25 patients with AD 
were analyzed. The hippocampus and entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial, 
precuneus, inferior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, lateral, and 
medial orbitofrontal cortices were used as regions of interest. CSF variables 
included Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/Abeta42 and p-tau/Abeta42. 
Regression analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of measures to 
diagnostic status as well as 2-year change in CDR-SB, MMSE, and delayed logical 
memory in MCI.
RESULTS: Hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/Abeta42 uniquely 
predicted diagnostic group. Change in CDR-SB was best predicted by retrosplenial 
thickness; MMSE, by retrosplenial metabolism and thickness; and delayed logical 
memory, by hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: All biomarkers were sensitive to the diagnostic group. Combining MR 
imaging morphometry and CSF biomarkers improved diagnostic classification 
(controls versus AD). MR imaging morphometry and PET were largely overlapping in 
value for discrimination. Baseline MR imaging and PET measures were more 
predictive of clinical change in MCI than were CSF measures.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors of missing data in a longitudinal study of 
Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a 
clinic-based, multicenter, longitudinal study with blood, CSF, PET, and MRI 
scans repeatedly measured in 229 participants with normal cognition (NC), 397 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 193 with mild AD during 2005-2007. We 
used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the 
associations between baseline demographic/clinical features and loss of 
biomarker follow-ups in ADNI.
RESULTS: CSF studies tended to recruit and retain patients with MCI with more 
AD-like features, including lower levels of baseline CSF Aβ(42). Depression was 
the major predictor for MCI dropouts, while family history of AD kept more 
patients with AD enrolled in PET and MRI studies. Poor cognitive performance was 
associated with loss of follow-up in most biomarker studies, even among NC 
participants. The presence of vascular risk factors seemed more critical than 
cognitive function for predicting dropouts in AD.
CONCLUSION: The missing data are not missing completely at random in ADNI and 
likely conditional on certain features in addition to cognitive function. 
Missing data predictors vary across biomarkers and even MCI and AD groups do not 
share the same missing data pattern. Understanding the missing data structure 
may help in the design of future longitudinal studies and clinical trials in AD.

It was unclear whether sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was a circulating 
biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the cross-sectional 
relationships between plasma SHBG and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in 
707 non-demented adults. Next, the influences of plasma SHBG on dynamic changes 
of CSF Aβ42, hippocampus volume, brain metabolism, and cognition were explored 
in 448 non-demented adults from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Finally, the predictive and diagnostic values of plasma SHBG in AD were 
explored. A positive correlation was found between SHBG levels in plasma and 
CSF. Individuals with higher plasma SHBG levels had lower CSF Aβ42 (p < 0.005), 
after adjusting for age, gender, education, APOE4 allele, and cognitive scores. 
Though no significant difference of plasma SHBG was observed between mild AD 
dementia and healthy normal, plasma SHBG could contribute to accelerated rates 
of CSF Aβ42 decrease (p < 0.0005), decline in brain metabolism (p < 0.05), and 
hippocampus atrophy (p < 0.01), cognitive decline (p < 0.01), as well as higher 
risk of AD dementia (p < 0.05). These findings indicated plasma SHBG could be a 
prodromal biomarker to predict disease progression in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Identifying low-cost, minimally-invasive screening instruments for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial enrichment will improve the efficiency of AD 
trials.
METHODS: A total of 685 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) were grouped according to cutoffs of genetic risk factor (G) 
polygenic hazard score (PHS) and tau pathology (T) plasma phosphorylated tau-181 
(p-tau181) into four groups: G+T+, G-T-, G+T-, and G-T+. We assessed the 
associations between group level and longitudinal cognitive decline and AD 
conversion. Power analyses compared the estimated sample size required to detect 
differences in cognitive decline.
RESULTS: The G+T+ group was associated with faster cognitive decline and higher 
AD risk. Clinical trials enrolling G+T+ participants would benefit from 
significantly reduced sample sizes compared with similar trials using only 
single makers as an inclusion criterion.
DISCUSSION: The combination of two low-cost, minimally-invasive 
measures-genetics and plasma biomarkers-would be a promising screening procedure 
for clinical trial enrollment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Participants with unimpaired or mildly impaired cognition were 
grouped based on cutoffs on genetic risk factors (G: polygenic hazardous score 
[PHS]) and Alzheimer's pathology (T: baseline plasma phosphorylated tau-181 
[p-tau181]). Participants with high PHSs and plasma p-tau181 levels (G+T+) were 
at risk of faster cognitive decline and AD progression. The combination of PHS 
and plasma p-tau181 could enhance clinical trial enrichment more effectively 
than using single biomarkers.

The North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was 
originally conceived as a study to develop markers of disease progression, but 
has also become a strong technological platform for the multi-centric collection 
of clinical data and imaging and biological markers. Because the ADNI platform 
was first imported in Europe, thanks to the pilot European ADNI, several 
ADNI-related initiatives have flourished, funded by the European Commission's 
7th Framework Programme, national governments, and the Alzheimer's Association 
aimed at: (i) collecting fresh data ADNI style (FP7 AddNeuroMed, Innovative 
Medicine Initiative Pharma-Cog/European ADNI, Swedish ADNI, and Italian ADNI); 
(ii) developing standard operational procedures for the collection of markers 
(International Harmonization of CSF Abeta42 and tau, and European Alzheimer's 
Disease Consortium-ADNI Harmonization of Hippocampal Volumetry); and (iii) 
developing infrastructures for the treatment of ADNI data (FP7 neuGRID and 
outGRID, and the French Centre pour l'Acquisition et le Traitement de l'Image). 
Although this fragmented scenario is not surprising given the structure of 
scientific funding in Europe, opportunities are being developed for high order 
networking and harmonization at the continental level (Joint Programming for 
Neurodegenerative Diseases).

INTRODUCTION: We integrated plasma biomarkers from the Taiwan Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and propose a workflow to identify individuals 
showing amyloid-positive positron emission tomography (PET) with 
low/intermediate tau burden based on [18F]Florzolotau PET-based quantification.
METHODS: We assessed 361 participants across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
non-AD continuum and measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, 
amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein levels at two medical centers. We evaluated the diagnostic 
potential of these biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among all plasma biomarkers, p-tau217 had the highest consistency with 
amyloid PET results (area under the curve = 0.94), and a cutoff value could have 
reduced the number of confirmatory amyloid PET scans by 57.5%. In amyloid 
PET-positive cases intending to use anti-amyloid therapy, p-tau217 level, along 
with clinical parameters, had the highest predictive ability for 
low/intermediate tau burden.
DISCUSSION: A two-step workflow based on p-tau217 and confirmatory amyloid PET 
could accurately classify AD patients showing low/intermediate tau burden.
HIGHLIGHTS: The emergence of anti-amyloid therapy increases the need to 
accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of plasma biomarkers, 
especially phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), can help in the diagnosis of AD. 
P-tau217 is a better predictor of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
positivity than other core biomarkers. In amyloid PET-positive individuals, 
p-tau217 can predict tau burden. We propose a two-step workflow to identify AD 
cases suitable for treatment.

Brain amyloid deposition is an early pathological event in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and abnormally low levels amyloid-β42 peptide (Aβ42) in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) can be detected in preclinical AD. To identify the genetic 
determinants that regulate the rate of CSF Aβ42 decline among non-demented 
elders, we conducted a genome-wide association study involved 321 non-demented 
elders from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1/GO/2 cohorts 
restricted to non-Hispanic Caucasians. A novel genome-wide significant 
association of higher annualized percent decline of CSF Aβ42 in the gene CBFA2T3 
(CBFA2/RUNX1 translocation partner 3; rs13333659-T; p = 2.24 × 10-9) was 
identified. Besides displaying abnormal CSF Aβ42 levels, rs13333659-T carriers 
were more likely to exhibit a greater longitudinal cognitive decline (p = 0.029, 
β = 0.097) and hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.029, β = -0.160) in the non-demented 
elders, especially for the participants who were amyloid-positive at baseline. 
These findings suggest rs13333659 in CBFA2T3 as a risk locus to modulate the 
decline rate of CSF Aβ42 preceding the onset of clinical symptoms.

BACKGROUND: There is accumulating evidence that synaptic loss precedes neuronal 
loss and correlates best with impaired memory formation in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is 
a newly discovered marker indicating synaptic damage. We here test CSF SNAP-25 
and SNAP-25/amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) ratio as a diagnostic marker for predicting 
cognitive decline and brain structural change in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
METHODS: We stratified 139 participants from the ADNI database into cognitively 
normal (CN; n = 52), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI; n = 22), 
progressive MCI (pMCI; n = 47), and dementia due to AD (n = 18). Spearman 
correlation was performed to test the relationships between biomarkers. Overall 
diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) was obtained from receiver 
operating curve (ROC) analyses. Cox proportional hazard models tested the effect 
of CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/Aβ42 measures on the conversion from MCI to AD. 
Relationships between the CSF SNAP-25 levels, SNAP-25/Aβ42 ratio, and diagnostic 
groups were tested with linear regressions. Linear mixed-effects models and 
linear regression models were used to evaluate CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/Aβ42 as 
predictors of AD features, including cognition measured by the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and brain structure and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) 
measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/Aβ42 were increased in patients with pMCI and 
AD compared with CN, and in pMCI and AD compared with sMCI. Cognitively normal 
subjects who progressed to MCI or AD during follow-up had increased SNAP-25/Aβ42 
ratio compared with nonprogressors. CSF SNAP-25, especially SNAP-25/Aβ42, offers 
diagnostic utility for pMCI and AD. CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/Aβ42 significantly 
predicted conversion from MCI to AD. In addition, elevated SNAP-25/Aβ42 ratio 
was associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in pMCI and the rate of 
change of cognitive impairment in CN over the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that both CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/Aβ42 ratio are 
already increased at the early clinical stage of AD, and indicate the promise of 
CSF SNAP-25 and SNAP-25/Aβ42 ratio as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for 
the earliest symptomatic stage of AD.

Apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE ε4) is the most significant genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated blood C-reactive protein (CRP) 
further increases the risk of AD for people carrying the APOE ε4 allele. We 
hypothesized that CRP, as a key inflammatory element, could modulate the impact 
of other genetic variants on AD risk. We selected ten single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in reported AD risk loci encoding proteins related to 
inflammation. We then tested the interaction effects between these SNPs and 
blood CRP levels on AD incidence using the Cox proportional hazards model in UK 
Biobank (n = 279,176 white participants with 803 incident AD cases). The five 
top SNPs were tested for their interaction with different CRP cutoffs for AD 
incidence in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Generation 2 cohort (n = 3009, 
incident AD = 156). We found that for higher concentrations of serum CRP, the AD 
risk increased for SNP genotypes in 3 AD-associated genes (SPI1, CD33, and CLU). 
Using the Cox model in stratified genotype analysis, the hazard ratios (HRs) for 
the association between a higher CRP level (≥10 vs. <10 mg/L) and the risk of 
incident AD were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.33-2.84, p < 0.001) for the SPI1 rs1057233-AA 
genotype, 1.75 (95% CI: 1.20-2.55, p = 0.004) for the CD33 rs3865444-CC 
genotype, and 1.76 (95% CI: 1.25-2.48, p = 0.001) for the CLU rs9331896-C 
genotype. In contrast, these associations were not observed in the other 
genotypes of these genes. Finally, two SNPs were validated in 321 Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. We 
observed that the SPI1 and CD33 genotype effects were enhanced by elevated CRP 
levels for the risk of MCI to AD conversion. Furthermore, the SPI1 genotype was 
associated with CSF AD biomarkers, including t-Tau and p-Tau, in the ADNI cohort 
when the blood CRP level was increased (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that 
elevated blood CRP, as a peripheral inflammatory biomarker, is an important 
moderator of the genetic effects of SPI1 and CD33 in addition to APOE ε4 on AD 
risk. Monitoring peripheral CRP levels may be helpful for precise intervention 
and prevention of AD for these genotype carriers.

OBJECTIVE: The pathologic validation of European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Center Harmonized Hippocampal 
Segmentation Protocol (HarP).
METHODS: Temporal lobes of nine Alzheimer's disease (AD) and seven cognitively 
normal subjects were scanned post-mortem at 7 Tesla. Hippocampal volumes were 
obtained with HarP. Six-micrometer-thick hippocampal slices were stained for 
amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and cresyl violet. Hippocampal subfields were manually 
traced. Neuronal counts, Aβ, and tau burden for each hippocampal subfield were 
obtained.
RESULTS: We found significant correlations between hippocampal volume and Braak 
and Braak staging (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau (ρ = -0.53, P = .034), Aβ burden (ρ 
= -0.61, P = .012), and neuronal count (ρ = 0.77, P < .001). Exploratory 
subfield-wise significant associations were found for Aβ in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 
(ρ = -0.58, P = .019) and subiculum (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau in CA2 (ρ = 
-0.59, P = .016), and CA3 (ρ = -0.5, P = .047), and neuronal count in CA1 (ρ = 
0.55, P = .028), CA3 (ρ = 0.65, P = .006), and CA4 (ρ = 0.76, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations provide pathological confirmation of 
hippocampal morphometry as a valid biomarker for AD and pathologic validation of 
HarP.

We aimed to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated with 
neurodegeneration in individuals with and without CSF evidence of Alzheimer 
pathology. We investigated 287 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) subjects (age=74.9±6.9; 22/48/30% with Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive 
impairment/controls) with CSF multiplex analyte data and serial volumetric MRI. 
We calculated brain and hippocampal atrophy rates, ventricular expansion and 
Mini Mental State Examination decline. We used false discovery rate corrected 
regression analyses to assess associations between CSF variables and atrophy 
rates in individuals with and without amyloid pathology, adjusting in stages for 
tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age, sex, ApoE4 status and diagnosis. Analytes 
showing statistically significant independent relationships were entered into 
reverse stepwise analyses. Adjusting for tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age, sex 
and ApoE4, 4/83 analytes were significantly independently associated with brain 
atrophy rate, 1/83 with ventricular expansion and 2/83 with hippocampal atrophy. 
The strongest CSF predictor for the three atrophy measures was low trefoil 
factor 3 (TFF3). High cystatin C (CysC) was associated with higher whole brain 
atrophy and hippocampal atrophy rates. Lower levels of vascular endothelial 
growth factor and chromogranin A (CrA) were associated with higher whole brain 
atrophy. In exploratory reverse stepwise analyses, lower TFF3 was associated 
with higher rates of whole brain, hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion. 
Lower levels of CrA were associated with higher whole brain atrophy rate. The 
relationship between low TFF3 and increased hippocampal atrophy rate remained 
after adjustment for diagnosis. We identified a series of CSF markers that are 
independently associated with rate of neurodegeneration in amyloid-positive 
individuals. TFF3, a substrate for NOTCH processing may be an important 
biomarker of neurodegeneration across the Alzheimer spectrum.

The Alzheimer disease (AD) continuum is a neurodegenerative disorder with 
cognitive decline and pathologic changes. Tau PET imaging can detect tau 
pathology, and 18F-flortaucipir PET imaging is expected to visualize progression 
through the stages of AD, for which quantitative assessment is essential. Two 
measurement methods, statistically defined multiblock barycentric discriminant 
analysis (MUBADA)/parametric estimation of reference signal intensity (PERSI) 
and anatomically defined tau meta-volume of interest (VOI)/cerebellar gray 
matter (CGM) for SUV ratio (SUVR), were compared in this study to assess their 
relationship to AD clinical stage using 2 open multicenter PET databases. 
Methods: Data were selected for 106 cases from 2 databases, AMED Preclinical AD 
study (AMED-PRE) (n = 15) and Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (n = 
91). The data of the participants were categorized into 4 groups based on the 
clinical criteria. Tau PET imaging was conducted using 18F-flortaucipir, and the 
2 SUVR measurement methods, MUBADA/PERSI and tau meta-VOI/CGM, were compared 
among different clinical categories: amyloid-negative cognitively normal, 
preclinical AD, amyloid-negative mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
amyloid-positive MCI. Results: Significant differences were found between 
cognitively normal and preclinical AD, as well as between cognitively normal and 
amyloid-positive MCI and between amyloid-negative MCI and -positive MCI in SUVR 
derived by MUBADA/PERSI, whereas SUVR by tau meta-VOI/CGM did not provide 
significant differences between any pair. The tau meta-VOI/CGM method 
consistently provided higher SUVRs and larger individual variations than 
MUBADA/PERSI, with a mean SUVR difference of 0.136 for the studied databases. 
Conclusion: MUBADA/PERSI provided the SUVR of 18F-flortaucipir uptake with 
better association with the clinical severity of the AD continuum and with 
smaller variability. The results support the usefulness of MUBADA/PERSI as a 
quantitative measure of 18F-flortaucipir uptake in multicenter studies using 
different PET systems and scanning methods. However, limitations of the study 
include the small sample size and the unbalanced distribution among clinical 
categories in the AMED Preclinical AD study database.

Previous work examining Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
normal controls using cluster analysis identified a subgroup characterized by 
substantial brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We 
hypothesized that these effects could be related to vascular damage. Fifty-three 
individuals in the suspected vascular cluster (Normal 2) were compared with 31 
individuals from the cluster characterized as healthy/typical (Normal 1) on a 
variety of outcomes, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, vascular risk factors and outcomes, 
cognitive trajectory, and medications for vascular conditions. Normal 2 was 
significantly older but did not differ on ApoE4+ prevalence. Normal 2 differed 
significantly from Normal 1 on all MRI measures but not on Amyloid-Beta1-42 or 
total tau protein. Normal 2 had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), 
Hachinksi score, and creatinine levels, and took significantly more medications 
for vascular conditions. Normal 2 had marginally significantly higher 
triglycerides and blood glucose. Normal 2 had a worse cognitive trajectory on 
the Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) 30-min delay test and the 
Functional Activity Questionnaire (FAQ). Cerebral atrophy associated with 
multiple vascular risks is common among cognitively normal individuals, forming 
a distinct subgroup with significantly increased cognitive decline. Further 
studies are needed to determine the clinical impact of these findings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence varies by sex, suggesting that sex 
chromosomes, sex hormones and/or their signaling could potentially modulate AD 
risk and progression. Low testosterone levels are reported in men with AD. 
Further, variation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene has been associated with 
AD risk and cognitive impairment. We assessed measures of plasma testosterone 
levels as a biomarker of AD in male participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Baseline testosterone levels were 
significantly different between clinical diagnosis groups [cognitively normal 
controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD], with the lowest testosterone 
levels in men with AD. Lower baseline testosterone levels were associated with 
higher baseline clinical severity. Change in testosterone levels between 
baseline and 1-year follow-up varied by diagnosis; MCI had the greatest 
decreases in testosterone levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Despite 
differences by clinical diagnosis, there was no association between plasma 
testosterone and CSF biomarkers of AD pathology. We also tested single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AR for association with AD risk in a separate 
cohort from ADNI and found 26 SNPs associated with risk for AD. The top 
associated SNP is predicted to be an expression quantitative trait locus for AR 
in multiple tissues, including brain, with the AD-associated risk allele 
predicted to confer lower AR expression. Our findings suggest a link between the 
androgen pathway and AD through Aβ/tau independent pathways. These effects may 
be most pronounced during conversion from MCI to dementia.

Recent developments of tau Positron Emission Tomography (PET) allows assessment 
of regional neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) deposition in human brain. Among the 
tau PET molecular probes, 18F-AV1451 is characterized by high selectivity for 
pathologic tau aggregates over amyloid plaques, limited non-specific binding in 
white and gray matter, and confined off-target binding. The objectives of the 
study are (1) to quantitatively characterize regional brain tau deposition 
measured by 18F-AV1451 PET in cognitively normal older adults (CN), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants; (2) to evaluate the 
correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and 18F-AV1451 PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR); 
and (3) to evaluate the partial volume effects on 18F-AV1451 brain uptake. 
Methods: The study included total 115 participants (CN = 49, MCI = 58, and AD = 
8) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Preprocessed 
18F-AV1451 PET images, structural MRIs, and demographic and clinical assessments 
were downloaded from the ADNI database. A reblurred Van Cittertiteration method 
was used for voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC) on PET images. Structural 
MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization and region of interest (ROI) 
definition in standard space. The parametric images of 18F-AV1451 SUVR relative 
to cerebellum were calculated. The ROI SUVR measurements from PVC and non-PVC 
SUVR images were compared. The correlation between ROI 18F-AV1451 SUVR and the 
measurements of MMSE, CSF total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were 
also assessed. Results: 18F-AV1451 prominently specific binding was found in the 
amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampus, fusiform, posterior cingulate, 
temporal, parietal, and frontal brain regions. Most regional SUVRs showed 
significantly higher uptake of 18F-AV1451 in AD than MCI and CN participants. 
SUVRs of small regions like amygdala, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus were 
statistically improved by PVC in all groups (p < 0.01). Although there was an 
increasing tendency of 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs in MCI group compared with CN group, no 
significant difference of 18F-AV1451 deposition was found between CN and MCI 
brains with or without PVC (p > 0.05). Declined MMSE score was observed with 
increasing 18F-AV1451 binding in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampus, 
and fusiform. CSF p-tau was positively correlated with 18F-AV1451 deposition. 
PVC improved the results of 18F-AV-1451 tau deposition and correlation studies 
in small brain regions. Conclusion: The typical deposition of 18F-AV1451 tau PET 
imaging in AD brain was found in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform and 
parahippocampus, and these regions were strongly associated with cognitive 
impairment and CSF biomarkers. Although more deposition was observed in MCI 
group, the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging could not differentiate the MCI patients from 
CN population. More tau deposition related to decreased MMSE score and increased 
level of CSF p-tau, especially in ROIs of amygdala, entorhinal cortex and 
parahippocampus. PVC did improve the results of tau deposition and correlation 
studies in small brain regions and suggest to be routinely used in 18F-AV1451 
tau PET quantification.

OBJECTIVES: While plasma biomarkers have been proposed to aid in the clinical 
diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), few biomarkers have been validated in 
independent patient cohorts. Here we aim to determine plasma biomarkers 
associated with AD in 2 independent cohorts and validate the findings in the 
multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
METHODS: Using a targeted proteomic approach, we measured levels of 190 plasma 
proteins and peptides in 600 participants from 2 independent centers (University 
of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and 
identified 17 analytes associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Four analytes (apoE, B-type natriuretic 
peptide, C-reactive protein, pancreatic polypeptide) were also found to be 
altered in clinical MCI/AD in the ADNI cohort (n = 566). Regression analysis 
showed CSF Aβ42 levels and t-tau/Aβ42 ratios to correlate with the number of 
APOE4 alleles and plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and pancreatic 
polypeptide.
CONCLUSION: Four plasma analytes were consistently associated with the diagnosis 
of very mild dementia/MCI/AD in 3 independent clinical cohorts. These plasma 
biomarkers may predict underlying AD through their association with CSF AD 
biomarkers, and the association between plasma and CSF amyloid biomarkers needs 
to be confirmed in a prospective study.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Rare variants in 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been identified as 
risk factors for AD. Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is 
a potential and novel biomarker of neuroinflammation implicated in the onset and 
progression of AD. To explore the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD, 
we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using the data from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found CSF sTREM2 levels 
were elevated with the disease stages, but there was no significant difference 
between that of AD patients and normal participants. CSF sTREM2 was positively 
correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (ρ > 0.35, p < 
1e-06; ρ > 0.32, p < 1e-05, respectively) for all disease states. We identified 
the most significant CSF sTREM2 related locus was rs7232 (FDR = 3.01e-08), a 
missense variant in MS4A6A gene of chromosome 11. Moreover, we also detected 
rs7232 was highly associated with MS4A6A gene expression (FDR = 1.37e-18). In 
addition, our pathway analysis for our significant GWAS results showed that 
biological processes for regulation of viruses and immune response were highly 
overrepresented or enriched. Our study suggests that CSF sTREM2 plays an 
informative role in AD progression. Moreover, CSF sTREM2 and AD is highly 
related to viral infections and immune response.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiatives ("ADNI") aim to 
validate neuroimaging and biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data 
of the pilot European-ADNI (E-ADNI) biological marker programme of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and plasma candidate biomarkers are reported.
METHODS: Six academic EADC centres recruited 49 subjects (healthy controls, 
subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD). We measured CSF 
beta-amyloid 42 (CSF Abeta42), total tau-protein (t-tau), phosphorylated 
tau-proteins (P-tau181, P-tau231), plasma beta-amyloid 40 and 42 
(Abeta40/Abeta42). Immediate fresh shipment was compared to freezing and later 
shipment on dry ice.
RESULTS: CSF T-tau (fresh samples) was increased in AD versus controls 
(p=0.049), CSF Abeta42 (frozen samples) was decreased in MCI and AD (p=0.02), as 
well as plasma Abeta40 (fresh and frozen samples) in AD (p=0.049 and p=0.016). 
Pooled values of neurochemical parameters and ratios thereof were different 
between centres (p<0.005). Analysis of frozen samples yielded higher diagnostic 
accuracy than immediate fresh shipment with 100% (fresh: 100%) correctly 
classified in control subjects, 100% (78%) in MCI, 91% (91%) in AD.
CONCLUSION: The use of frozen rather than fresh samples renders higher 
diagnostic accuracy within a multicentre context. We confirmed the feasibility 
of a multicentre AD biomarker programme for future clinical trials.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 42 amino acid species of amyloid beta (Aβ42) and tau 
levels are strongly correlated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
neuropathology including amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration and have been 
successfully used as endophenotypes for genetic studies of AD. Additional CSF 
analytes may also serve as useful endophenotypes that capture other aspects of 
AD pathophysiology. Here we have conducted a genome-wide association study of 
CSF levels of 59 AD-related analytes. All analytes were measured using the Rules 
Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel, which includes analytes relevant to 
several disease-related processes. Data from two independently collected and 
measured datasets, the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were analyzed separately, 
and combined results were obtained using meta-analysis. We identified genetic 
associations with CSF levels of 5 proteins (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), 
Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), 
Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)) with 
study-wide significant p-values (p<1.46×10-10) and significant, consistent 
evidence for association in both the Knight ADRC and the ADNI samples. These 
proteins are involved in amyloid processing and pro-inflammatory signaling. SNPs 
associated with ACE, IL6R and MMP3 protein levels are located within the coding 
regions of the corresponding structural gene. The SNPs associated with CSF 
levels of CCL4 and CCL2 are located in known chemokine binding proteins. The 
genetic associations reported here are novel and suggest mechanisms for genetic 
control of CSF and plasma levels of these disease-related proteins. Significant 
SNPs in ACE and MMP3 also showed association with AD risk. Our findings suggest 
that these proteins/pathways may be valuable therapeutic targets for AD. Robust 
associations in cognitively normal individuals suggest that these SNPs also 
influence regulation of these proteins more generally and may therefore be 
relevant to other diseases.

Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, 
present as low burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their 
effectiveness in diagnosis of Alzheimer's or predicting its trajectory is still 
unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive 
assessments provide for identifying those at high risk for cognitive decline. We 
analyzed >500 ADNI participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive 
assessment and Aβ/tau PET scans, examining their ability to distinguish 
cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. Performance on the digital 
cognitive assessment were superior to both cortical Aβ and entorhinal tau in 
detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic 
discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting 
decline and future tau accumulation. Digital assessments are effective in 
identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools 
for early Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.

Previously it was reported that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have reduced 
amyloid (Aβ 1-42) and elevated total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau 
181p) in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), suggesting that these same measures 
could be used to detect early AD pathology in healthy elderly (CN) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that there 
would be an association among rates of regional brain atrophy, the CSF 
biomarkers Aβ 1-42, t-tau, and p-tau 181p and ApoE ε4 status, and that the 
pattern of this association would be diagnosis specific. Our findings primarily 
showed that lower CSF Aβ 1-42 and higher tau concentrations were associated with 
increased rates of regional brain tissue loss and the patterns varied across the 
clinical groups. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CSF biomarker 
concentrations are associated with the characteristic patterns of structural 
brain changes in CN and MCI that resemble to a large extent the pathology seen 
in AD. Therefore, the finding of faster progression of brain atrophy in the 
presence of lower Aβ 1-42 levels and higher p-tau levels supports the hypothesis 
that CSF Aβ 1-42 and tau are measures of early AD pathology. Moreover, the 
relationship among CSF biomarkers, ApoE ε4 status, and brain atrophy rates are

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that cortical and hippocampal volumes, 
measured in vivo from volumetric MRI (vMRI) scans, could be used to identify 
variant subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and to prospectively predict the rate 
of clinical decline.
METHODS: Amyloid-positive participants with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1 and ADNI2 with baseline MRI scans (n = 229) and 
2-year clinical follow-up (n = 100) were included. AD subtypes (hippocampal 
sparing [HpSpMRI], limbic predominant [LPMRI], typical AD [tADMRI]) were defined 
according to an algorithm analogous to one recently proposed for tau 
neuropathology. Relationships between baseline hippocampal volume to cortical 
volume ratio (HV:CTV) and clinical variables were examined by both continuous 
regression and categorical models.
RESULTS: When participants were divided categorically, the HpSpMRI group showed 
significantly more AD-like hypometabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (p < 
0.05) and poorer baseline executive function (p < 0.001). Other baseline 
clinical measures did not differ across the 3 groups. Participants with HpSpMRI 
also showed faster subsequent clinical decline than participants with LPMRI on 
the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, 13-Item Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire 
(all p < 0.05) and tADMRI on the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) (both p < 0.05). Finally, a larger HV:CTV was associated with poorer 
baseline executive function and a faster slope of decline in CDR-SB, MMSE, and 
ADAS-Cog13 score (p < 0.05). These associations were driven mostly by the amount 
of cortical rather than hippocampal atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: AD subtypes with phenotypes consistent with those observed with tau 
neuropathology can be identified in vivo with vMRI. An increased HV:CTV ratio 
was predictive of faster clinical decline in participants with AD who were 
clinically indistinguishable at baseline except for a greater dysexecutive 
presentation.

OBJECTIVE: We describe the operationalization of the National Institute on 
Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) workgroup diagnostic guidelines 
pertaining to Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia in a large multicenter group of 
subjects with AD dementia.
METHODS: Subjects with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) with at least 1 amyloid biomarker (n = 211) were included in 
this report. Biomarker data from CSF Aβ42, amyloid PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, 
and MRI were examined. The biomarker results were assessed on a per-patient 
basis and the subject categorization as defined in the NIA-AA workgroup 
guidelines was determined.
RESULTS: When using a requirement that subjects have a positive amyloid 
biomarker and single neuronal injury marker having an AD pattern, 87% (48% for 
both neuronal injury biomarkers) of the subjects could be categorized as "high 
probability" for AD. Amyloid status of the combined Pittsburgh compound B-PET 
and CSF results showed an amyloid-negative rate of 10% in the AD group. In the 
ADNI AD group, 5 of 92 subjects fit the category "dementia unlikely due to AD" 
when at least one neuronal injury marker was negative.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of subjects with AD dementia in ADNI may be 
categorized more definitively as high-probability AD using the proposed 
biomarker scheme in the NIA-AA criteria. A minority of subjects may be excluded 
from the diagnosis of AD by using biomarkers in clinically categorized AD 
subjects. In a well-defined AD dementia population, significant biomarker 
inconsistency can be seen on a per-patient basis.

Clinical trials of disease modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might benefit from enrichment with 
true AD cases. Four hundred five MCI patients (143 converters and 262 
nonconverters to AD within 2 years) of the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) were used. Markers for enrichment were hippocampal atrophy on 
magnetic resonance (MRI), temporoparietal hypometabolism on FDG PET, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, and phospho-tau), and 
cortical amyloid deposition (11C-PIB positron emission tomography (PET)). Two 
separate enrichment strategies were tested to A) maximize the proportion of MCI 
converters screened in, and B) minimize the proportion of MCI converters 
screened out. Based on strategy A, when compared with no enrichment and ADAS-Cog 
as an outcome measure (sample size of 834), enrichment with 18F-FDG PET and 
hippocampal volume lowered samples size to 260 and 277 cases per arm, but at the 
cost of screening out 1,597 and 434 cases per arm. When compared with no 
enrichment and clinical dementia rating (CDR-SOB) as an outcome measure (sample 
size of 674), enrichment with hippocampal volume and Abeta42 lowered sample 
sizes to 191 and 291 cases per arm, with 639 and 157 screened out cases. 
Strategy B reduced the number of screened out cases (740 for [11C]-PIB PET, 101 
hippocampal volume, 82 ADAS-COG and 330 for [18F]-FDG PET) but at the expense of 
decreased power and a relative increase size (740 for [11C]-PIB PET, 676 for 
hippocampal volume, 744 for ADAS-Cog, and 517 for [18F]-FDG PET). Enrichment 
comes at the price of an often relevant proportion of screened out cases, and in 
clinical trial settings, the balance between enrichment of screened in and loss 
of screened out patients should be critically discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Discrepancy-based Evidence for Loss of 
Thinking Abilities (DELTA) score. The DELTA score characterizes the strength of 
evidence for cognitive decline on a continuous spectrum using well-established 
psychometric principles for improving detection of cognitive changes.
METHODS: DELTA score development used neuropsychological test scores from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (two tests each from 
Memory, Executive Function, and Language domains). We derived regression-based 
normative reference scores using age, gender, years of education, and 
word-reading ability from robust cognitively normal ADNI participants. 
Discrepancies between predicted and observed scores were used for calculating 
the DELTA score (range 0-15). We validated DELTA scores primarily against 
longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) and Functional 
Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) scores (baseline assessment through Year 3) using 
linear mixed models and secondarily against cross-sectional Alzheimer's 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: There were 1359 ADNI participants with calculable baseline DELTA scores 
(age 73.7 ± 7.1 years, 55.4% female, 100% white/Caucasian). Higher baseline 
DELTA scores (stronger evidence of cognitive decline) predicted higher baseline 
CDR-SOB (ΔR2 = .318) and faster rates of CDR-SOB increase over time (ΔR2 = 
.209). Longitudinal changes in DELTA scores tracked closely and in the same 
direction as CDR-SOB scores (fixed and random effects of mean + mean-centered 
DELTA, ΔR2 > .7). Results were similar for FAQ scores. High DELTA scores 
predicted higher PET-Aβ SUVr (ρ = 324), higher CSF-pTau/CSF-Aβ ratio (ρ = .460), 
and demonstrated PPV > .9 for positive Alzheimer's disease biomarker 
classification.
CONCLUSIONS: Data support initial development and validation of the DELTA score 
through its associations with longitudinal functional changes and Alzheimer's 
biomarkers. We provide several considerations for future research and include an 
automated scoring program for clinical use.

A genome-wide association study of longitudinal change in CSF tau among 
non-demented elderly.

Liu Y, Zhang N, Liu S, Zhong X, Wang L.

METHODS: This study conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 
longitudinal CSF t-tau and genotype data from 319 non-Hispanic Caucasians within 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The aim was to 
identify genetic determinants influencing the rate of change in CSF t-tau, a key 
biomarker in AD.
RESULTS: The GWAS identified a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 
rs17149074, within the C9orf171 (CFAP77) gene region that showed significant 
association with changes in CSF t-tau over time. Additionally, five other 
SNPs-rs10916844, rs10916846, rs9425869, rs3744474, and rs8078303-were found to 
potentially influence CSF t-tau variability.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings not only enhance our understanding of t-tau's 
progression in AD but also suggest that these identified SNPs could serve as 
novel genetic biomarkers, potentially providing novel insights in the prognostic 
landscape of AD by refining the predictive value of CSF-tau measurements (Tab. 
2, Fig. 2, Ref. 31). Text in PDF www.elis.sk Keywords: cerebrospinal fluid,

Cerebral atrophy rate is increasingly used as an outcome measure for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) trials. We used the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI) dataset to assess if adjusting for baseline characteristics can reduce 
sample sizes. Controls (n = 199), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
(n = 334) and AD (n = 144) had two MRI scans, 1-year apart; approximately 55% 
had baseline CSF tau, p-tau, and Abeta1-42. Whole brain (KN-BSI) and hippocampal 
(HMAPS-HBSI) atrophy rate, and ventricular expansion (VBSI) were calculated for 
each group; numbers required to power a placebo-controlled trial were estimated. 
Sample sizes per arm (80% power, 25% absolute rate reduction) for AD were (95% 
CI): brain atrophy = 81 (64,109), hippocampal atrophy = 88 (68,119), ventricular 
expansion = 118 (92,157); and for MCI: brain atrophy = 149 (122,188), 
hippocampal atrophy = 201 (160,262), ventricular expansion = 234 (191,295). To 
detect a 25% reduction relative to normal aging required increased sample sizes 
approximately 3-fold (AD), and approximately 5-fold (MCI). Disease severity and 
Abeta1-42 contributed significantly to atrophy rate variability. Adjusting for 
11 predefined covariates reduced sample sizes by up to 30%. Treatment trials in 
AD should consider the effects of normal aging; adjusting for baseline 
characteristics can significantly reduce required sample sizes.

Recently, a large meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies (GWAS) 
identified a novel locus (rs2718058) adjacent to NME8 that played a preventive 
role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this link between the single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058 and the pathology of AD have not been 
mentioned yet. Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association 
between the NME8 rs2718058 genotypes and AD-related measures including the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, tau, P-tau concentrations, neuroimaging 
biomarkers and cognitive performance, in a large cohort from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used information of a total of 719 
individuals, including 211 normal cognition (NC), 346 mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and 162 AD. Although we didn't observe a positive relationship between 
rs2718058 and AD, it was significantly associated with several AD related 
endophenotypes. Among the normal cognitively normal participants, the minor 
allele G carriers showed significantly associated with higher CDRSB score than A 
allele carriers (P = 0.021). Occipital gyrus atrophy were significantly 
associated with NME8 genotype status (P = 0.002), with A allele carriers has 
more atrophy than the minor allele G carriers in AD patients; lateral ventricle 
(both right and left) cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) were 
significantly associated with NME8 genotype (P < 0.05), with GA genotype had 
higher metabolism than GG and AA genotypes in MCI group; the atrophic right 
hippocampus in 18 months is significantly different between the three group, 
with GG and AA genotypes had more hippocampus atrophy than GA genotypes in the 
whole group. Together, our results are consistent with the direction of previous 
research, suggesting that NME8 rs2718058 appears to play a role in lowering the 
brain neurodegeneration.

APOE ε4 allele is a major risk factor in Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). 
Distinct phenotypes that depend on the APOE ε4 status have been demonstrated. 
The genetic etiology of APOE ε4 non-carriers is still elusive. Thus we 
investigated the genetic components of AD that is independent of APOE ε4 by 
combining genome association analysis with quantitative trait analyses in 
non-Hispanic Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer' s Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Five top susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in three loci in ZNF827, KDM2B and NANP were initially identified in APOE 
ε4 non-carriers and four of these SNPs were confirmed in mild cognitive 
impairment. These SNPs and one nominally significant SNP are located in three 
haplotype blocks. Quantitative trait analyses of these haplotype blocks 
demonstrated that the haplotype block in ZNF827 was associated with CSF Aβ₄₂ 
level, and the haplotype block in KDM2B with CSF p-tau₁₈₁p and p-tau₁₈₁p/Aβ₄₂ 
ratio. The haplotype block between NANP and NINL was associated with brain 
atrophy. Moreover, these SNPs took additive effects on AD incidence and 
demonstrated the interaction with APOE ε4 status. Therefore, we conclude that 
these novel loci are associated with AD in APOE ε4 non-carriers. This study 
indicates the distinct genetic risk genes for AD non-carrying APOE ε4 and 
provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative 
disease impacting an estimated 44 million adults worldwide. The causal pathology 
of AD (accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau), precedes hallmark symptoms of 
dementia by more than a decade, necessitating development of early diagnostic 
markers of disease onset, particularly for new drugs that aim to modify disease 
processes. To evaluate differentially methylated positions (DMPs) as novel 
blood-based biomarkers of AD, we used a subset of 653 individuals with 
peripheral blood (PB) samples in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) consortium. The selected cohort of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and age-matched healthy controls (CN) all had imaging, genetics, 
transcriptomics, cerebrospinal protein markers, and comprehensive clinical 
records, providing a rich resource of concurrent multi-omics and phenotypic 
information on a well-phenotyped subset of ADNI participants.
RESULTS: In this manuscript, we report cross-diagnosis differential peripheral 
DNA methylation in a cohort of AD, MCI, and age-matched CN individuals with 
longitudinal DNA methylation measurements. Epigenome-wide association studies 
(EWAS) were performed using a mixed model with repeated measures over time with 
a P value cutoff of 1 × 10-5 to test contrasts of pairwise differential 
peripheral methylation in AD vs CN, AD vs MCI, and MCI vs CN. The most highly 
significant differentially methylated loci also tracked with Mini Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores. Differentially methylated loci were enriched near 
brain and neurodegeneration-related genes (e.g., BDNF, BIN1, APOC1) validated 
using the genotype tissue expression project portal (GTex).
CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows that peripheral differential methylation between 
age-matched subjects with AD relative to healthy controls will provide 
opportunities to further investigate and validate differential methylation as a 
surrogate of disease. Given the inaccessibility of brain tissue, the 
PB-associated methylation marks may help identify the stage of disease and 
progression phenotype, information that would be central to bringing forward 
successful drugs for AD.

Tensor-based morphometry can recover three-dimensional longitudinal brain 
changes over time by nonlinearly registering baseline to follow-up MRI scans of 
the same subject. Here, we compared the anatomical distribution of longitudinal 
brain structural changes, over 12 months, using a subset of the ADNI dataset 
consisting of 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 40 healthy elderly 
controls, and 40 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Each 
individual longitudinal change map (Jacobian map) was created using an unbiased 
registration technique, and spatially normalized to a geometrically-centered 
average image based on healthy controls. Voxelwise statistical analyses revealed 
regional differences in atrophy rates, and these differences were correlated 
with clinical measures and biomarkers. Consistent with prior studies, we 
detected widespread cerebral atrophy in AD, and a more restricted atrophic 
pattern in MCI. In MCI, temporal lobe atrophy rates were correlated with changes 
in mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores, clinical dementia rating (CDR), and 
logical/verbal learning memory scores. In AD, temporal atrophy rates were 
correlated with several biomarker indices, including a higher CSF level of p-tau 
protein, and a greater CSF tau/beta amyloid 1-42 (ABeta42) ratio. Temporal lobe 
atrophy was significantly faster in MCI subjects who converted to AD than in 
non-converters. Serial MRI scans can therefore be analyzed with nonlinear image 
registration to relate ongoing neurodegeneration to a variety of pathological 
biomarkers, cognitive changes, and conversion from MCI to AD, tracking disease 
progression in 3-dimensional detail.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β2-microglobulin (β2M) has been 
demonstrated as an important factor in β-amyloid (Aβ) neurotoxicity and a 
potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, more investigation is 
required to ascertain the relationship between β2M and glial activities in AD 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: In this study, 211 participants from the Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with CSF and Plasma β2M, CSF glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 
(sTREM2), Aβ42, phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) were divided 
into four groups, stage 0, 1, 2, and suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) based on 
the National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria. 
Multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects models, and causal mediation 
analyses bootstrapped 10,000 iterations were used to investigate the underlying 
associations among β2M and CSF biomarkers at baseline and during a longitudinal 
visit.
RESULTS: CSF β2M concentration decreased with amyloid in stage 1 compared with 
stage 0 and increased with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in stage 2 and 
SNAP compared with stage 1. Moreover, CSF β2M level was positively correlated 
with the Aβ42 (β = 0.230), P-tau (β = 0.564), T-tau (β = 0.603), GFAP 
(β = 0.552), and sTREM2 (β = 0.641) (all P < 0.001). CSF β2M was only 
longitudinally correlated with T-tau change. The correlation of CSF β2M with 
P-tau (proportion = 25.4%, P < 0.001) and T-tau (proportion = 26.7%, P < 0.001) 
was partially mediated by GFAP in total participants, reproduced in late-life 
individuals. Furthermore, the astrocyte cascade also partially mediated the 
pathological relationship between CSF β2M and tau pathology 
(β2M → GFAP → YKL-40 → P-tau/T-tau, IE: 0.424-0.435, all P < 0.001). 
Nevertheless, the mediation effects of sTREM2 were not significant. 
Additionally, there was no association between plasma β2M and CSF biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF β2M is dynamic in AD pathology and associated with 
neuroinflammation. CSF GFAP might mediate the association between β2M and tau 
pathology, complementing the existing research on the effect of β2M in AD 
pathology and providing a new perspective on treatment.

Hippocampal volume change over time, measured with MRI, has huge potential as a 
marker for Alzheimer's disease. The objectives of this study were: (i) to test 
if constant and accelerated hippocampal loss can be detected in Alzheimer's 
disease, mild cognitive impairment and normal ageing over short periods, e.g. 
6-12 months, with MRI in the large multicentre setting of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); (ii) to determine the extent to which 
the polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene modulates hippocampal 
change; and (iii) to determine if rates of hippocampal loss correlate with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, such as the 
beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) and tau proteins (tau). The MRI multicentre study 
included 112 cognitive normal elderly individuals, 226 mild cognitive impairment 
and 96 Alzheimer's disease patients who all had at least three successive MRI 
scans, involving 47 different imaging centres. The mild cognitive impairment and 
Alzheimer's disease groups showed hippocampal volume loss over 6 months and 
accelerated loss over 1 year. Moreover, increased rates of hippocampal loss were 
associated with presence of the ApoE allele epsilon4 gene in Alzheimer's disease 
and lower CSF Abeta(1-42) in mild cognitive impairment, irrespective of ApoE 
genotype, whereas relations with tau were only trends. The power to measure 
hippocampal change was improved by exploiting correlations statistically between 
successive MRI observations. The demonstration of considerable hippocampal loss 
in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients over only 6 months 
and accelerated loss over 12 months illustrates the power of MRI to track 
morphological brain changes over time in a large multisite setting. Furthermore, 
the relations between faster hippocampal loss in the presence of ApoE allele 
epsilon4 and decreased CSF Abeta(1-42) supports the concept that increased 
hippocampal loss is an indicator of Alzheimer's disease pathology and a 
potential marker for the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's 
disease.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a crucial starting point in 
disease management. Blood-based biomarkers could represent a considerable 
advantage in providing AD-risk information in primary care settings. Here, we 
report new data for a relatively unknown blood-based biomarker that holds 
promise for AD diagnosis. We evaluate a p53-misfolding conformation recognized 
by the antibody 2D3A8, also named Unfolded p53 (U-p532D3A8+), in 375 plasma 
samples derived from InveCe.Ab and PharmaCog/E-ADNI longitudinal studies. A 
machine learning approach is used to combine U-p532D3A8+ plasma levels with 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and apolipoprotein E epsilon-4 (APOEε4) and 
is able to predict AD likelihood risk in InveCe.Ab with an overall 86.67% 
agreement with clinical diagnosis. These algorithms also accurately classify 
(AUC = 0.92) Aβ+-amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) patients who will 
develop AD in PharmaCog/E-ADNI, where subjects were stratified according to 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD markers (Aβ42 and p-Tau). Results support 
U-p532D3A8+ plasma level as a promising additional candidate blood-based 
biomarker for AD.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) measures abilities 
broadly related to executive function (EF), including WAIS-R Digit Symbol 
Substitution, Digit Span Backwards, Trails A and B, Category Fluency, and Clock 
Drawing. This study investigates whether a composite executive function measure 
based on these multiple indicators has better psychometric characteristics than 
the widely used individual components. We applied item response theory methods 
to 800 ADNI participants to derive an EF composite score (ADNI-EF) from the 
above measures. We then compared ADNI-EF with component measures in 390 
longitudinally-followed participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with 
respect to: (1) Ability to detect change over time; (2) Ability to predict 
conversion to dementia; (3) Strength of cross-sectional association with 
MRI-derived measures of structures involved in frontal systems, and (4) Strength 
of baseline association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid β₁₋₄₂, 
total tau, and phosphorylated tau(181P). ADNI-EF showed the greatest change over 
time, followed closely by Category Fluency. ADNI-EF needed a 40 % smaller sample 
size to detect change. ADNI-EF was the strongest predictor of AD conversion. 
ADNI-EF was the only measure significantly associated with all the MRI regions, 
though other measures were more strongly associated in a few of the regions. 
ADNI-EF was associated with all the CSF measures. ADNI-EF appears to be a useful 
composite measure of EF in MCI, as good as or better than any of its composite 
parts. This study demonstrates an approach to developing a psychometrically 
sophisticated composite score from commonly-used tests.

BACKGROUND: Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid with 
Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and Aβ42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF 
Aβ42) demonstrate a highly significant inverse correlation. Both these 
techniques are presumed to measure brain Aβ amyloid load. The objectives of this 
study were to develop a method to transform CSF Aβ42 measures into calculated 
PIB measures (PIBcalc) of Aβ amyloid load, and to partially validate the method 
in an independent sample of subjects.
METHODS: In all, 41 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) underwent PIB PET imaging and lumbar puncture (LP) at the same 
time. This sample, referred to as the "training" sample (nine cognitively normal 
subjects, 22 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 subjects with 
Alzheimer's disease), was used to develop a regression model by which CSF Aβ42 
(with apolipoprotein E ɛ4 carrier status as a covariate) was transformed into 
units of PIB PET (PIBcalc). An independent "supporting" sample of 362 ADNI 
subjects (105 cognitively normal subjects, 164 subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment, and 93 subjects with Alzheimer's disease) who underwent LP but not 
PIB PET imaging had their CSF Aβ42 values converted to PIBcalc. These values 
were compared with the overall PIB PET distribution found in the ADNI subjects 
(n=102).
RESULTS: A linear regression model demonstrates good prediction of actual PIB 
PET from CSF Aβ42 measures obtained in the training sample (R(2)=0.77, P<.001). 
PIBcalc data (derived from CSF Aβ42) in the supporting sample of 362 ADNI 
subjects who underwent LP but not PIB PET imaging demonstrate group-wise 
distributions that are highly consistent with the larger ADNI PIB PET 
distribution and with published PIB PET imaging studies.
CONCLUSION: Although the precise parameters of this model are specific for the 
ADNI sample, we conclude that CSF Aβ42 can be transformed into PIBcalc measures 
of Aβ amyloid load. Brain Aβ amyloid load can be ascertained at baseline in 
therapeutic or observational studies by either CSF or amyloid PET imaging and 
the data can be pooled using well-established multiple imputation techniques 
that account for the uncertainty in a CSF-based PIBcalc value.

The apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE is glycosylated with an O-linked Core-1 
sialylated glycan at several sites, yet the impact and function of this 
glycosylation on AD biomarkers remains unclear. We examined apoE glycosylation 
in a cohort of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=181) and plasma (n= 178) samples from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) stratified into 4 groups: 
cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), progressors and 
non-progressors based on delayed word recall performance over 4 years. We 
observed decreasing glycosylation from apoE2 > apoE3 > apoE4 in CSF, and in 
plasma (apoE3 > apoE4). ApoE glycosylation was reduced in the MCI compared with 
CN groups, and in progressors compared to non-progressors. In CSF, higher apoE 
glycosylation associated cross-sectionally with lower total tau (t-tau), 
p-tau181, and with higher Aβ 1-42 . Similar associations of apoE glycosylation 
with higher Aβ 1-42 were observed in plasma. In CSF, greater apoE4 glycosylation 
was associated with lower t-tau and p-tau181. Over a 6-year period, higher 
baseline levels of CSF apoE glycosylation predicted lower rates of increase in 
CSF t-tau and p-tau181 and lower rates of decrease in CSF Aβ 1-42 . These 
results indicate strong associations of apoE glycosylation with biomarkers of AD 
pathology independent of apoE genotype, warranting a deeper understanding of the 
functional role of apoE glycosylation on AD tau pathology.

Cognitive decline in old age is tightly linked with brain atrophy, causing 
significant burden. It is critical to identify which biomarkers are most 
predictive of cognitive decline and brain atrophy in the elderly. In 566 older 
adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we used a 
novel unsupervised machine learning approach to evaluate an extensive list of 
more than 200 potential brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based 
predictors of cognitive decline. The method, called CorEx, discovers groups of 
variables with high multivariate mutual information and then constructs latent 
factors that explain these correlations. The approach produces a hierarchical 
structure and the predictive power of biological variables and latent factors 
are compared with regression. We found that a group of variables containing the 
well-known AD risk gene APOE and CSF tau and amyloid levels were highly 
correlated. This latent factor was the most predictive of cognitive decline and 
brain atrophy.

Deposition of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) as amyloid deposits characterizes 
the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mutations in presenilin 
genes linked to familial AD (FAD) have been shown to increase production of 
Abeta42, an initially and predominantly depositing Abeta species in all types of 
AD. PS has been shown to serve as the catalytic center for the gamma-secretase 
cleavage of a subset of single-pass membrane proteins including beta-amyloid 
precursor protein and Notch. gamma-Secretase inhibitors, including 
gamma42-selective inhibitors like NSAIDs, are emerging therapeutic agents for 
AD. Also, an establishment of a method to monitor the progression of AD using 
imaging and biochemical surrogate markers would be vital to the evaluation of 
the effects of disease-modifying drugs for AD. In this regard, a large-scale 
observation study, like the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), should be 
conducted in Japan.

The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of four of the most 
validated biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) 
Abeta 1-42, tau, hippocampal volume, and FDG-PET, in patients at different stage 
of AD. Two hundred twenty-nine cognitively healthy subjects, 154 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) patients converted to AD, and 193 (95 early and 98 late) AD 
patients were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. For each biomarker, individual values were Z-transformed and 
plotted against ADAS-cog scores, and sigmoid and linear fits were compared. For 
most biomarkers the sigmoid model fitted data significantly better than the 
linear model. Abeta 1-42 time course followed a steep curve, stabilizing early 
in the disease course. CSF tau and hippocampal volume changed later showing 
similar monotonous trends, reflecting disease progression. Hippocampal loss 
trend was steeper and occurred earlier in time in APOE epsilon4 carriers than in 
non-carriers. FDG-PET started changing early in time and likely followed a 
linear decline. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in favor 
of the dynamic biomarker model which has recently been proposed.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a major negative impact on people's 
quality of life, life, and health. More research is needed to determine the 
relationship between age and the pathologic products associated with AD. 
Meanwhile, the construction of an early diagnostic model of AD, which is mainly 
characterized by pathological products, is very important for the diagnosis and 
treatment of AD.
METHOD: We collected clinical study data from September 2005 to August 2024 from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using 
correlation analysis method like cor function, we analyzed the pathology 
products (t-Tau, p-Tau, and Aβ proteins), age, gender, and Minimum Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores in the ADNI data. Next, we investigated the 
relationship between pathologic products and age in the AD and non-AD groups 
using linear regression. Ultimately, we used these features to build a 
diagnostic model for AD.
RESULTS: A total of 1,255 individuals were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 
73.27 [7.26] years; 691male [55.1%]; 564 female [44.9%]). The results of the 
correlation analysis showed that the correlations between pathologic products 
and age were, in descending order, Tau (Corr=0.75), p-Tau (Corr=0.71), and Aβ 
(Corr=0.54). In the AD group, t-Tau protein showed a tendency to decrease with 
age, but it was not statistically significant. p-Tau protein levels similarly 
decreased with age and its decrease was statistically significant. In contrast 
to Tau protein, in the AD group, Aβ levels increased progressively with age. In 
the non-AD group, the trend of pathologic product levels with age was 
consistently opposite to that of the AD group. We finally screened the optimal 
AD diagnostic model (AUC=0.959) based on the results of correlation analysis and 
by using the Xgboost algorithm and SVM algorithm.
CONCLUSION: In a novel finding, we observed that Tau protein and Aβ had opposite 
trends with age in both the AD and non-AD groups. The linear regression curves 
of the AD and non-AD groups had completely opposite trends. Through a machine 
learning approach, we constructed an AD diagnostic model with excellent 
performance based on the selected features.

To determine if a multi-analyte cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) peptide signature can 
be used to differentiate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and normal aged controls (NL), 
and to determine if this signature can also predict progression from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, analysis of CSF samples was done on the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The profiles of 320 
peptides from baseline CSF samples of 287 subjects over a 3-6 year period were 
analyzed. As expected, the peptide most able to differentiate between AD vs. NL 
was found to be Apolipoprotein E. Other peptides, some of which are not 
classically associated with AD, such as heart fatty acid binding protein, and 
the neuronal pentraxin receptor, also differentiated disease states. A 
sixteen-analyte signature was identified which differentiated AD vs. NL with an 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, which was better 
than any combination of amyloid beta (1-42), tau, and phospho-181 tau. This same 
signature, when applied to a new and independent data set, also strongly 
predicted both probability and rate of future progression of MCI subjects to AD, 
better than traditional markers. These data suggest that multivariate peptide 
signatures from CSF predict MCI to AD progression, and point to potentially new 
roles for certain proteins not typically associated with AD.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), Aβ triggers p-tau secretion, which drives tau 
aggregation. Therefore, it is critical to characterize modulators of Aβ-related 
p-tau increases which may alter AD trajectories. Here, we assessed whether 
factors known to alter tau levels in AD modulate the association between 
fibrillar Aβ and secreted p-tau181 determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
To assess potentially modulating effects of female sex, younger age, and ApoE4, 
we included 322 ADNI participants with cross-sectional/longitudinal p-tau181. To 
determine effects of microglial activation on p-tau181, we included 454 subjects 
with cross-sectional CSF sTREM2. Running ANCOVAs for nominal and linear 
regressions for metric variables, we found that women had higher Aβ-related 
p-tau181 levels. Higher sTREM2 was associated with elevated p-tau181, with 
stronger associations in women. Similarly, ApoE4 was related to higher p-tau181 
levels and faster p-tau181 increases, with stronger effects in female ApoE4 
carriers. Our results show that sex alone modulates the Aβ to p-tau axis, where 
women show higher Aβ-dependent p-tau secretion, potentially driven by elevated 
sTREM2-related microglial activation and stronger effects of ApoE4 carriership 
in women.

BACKGROUND: Depression is considered a psychological risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We sought to examine the differential associations of depression 
severity with cognitive decline, clinical progression to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD, and neuroimaging markers of AD in cognitively normal 
older adults.
METHODS: A total of 522 cognitively normal (CN) participants who underwent 
assessments for depression (longitudinal geriatric depression scale [GDS] ) and 
cognitive assessments were included from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of 
the rate of change in GDS with amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography 
(PET), tau-PET, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET were explored. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves of clinical progression and Aβ accumulation were plotted based 
on mean annual changes in GDS. Mediation analyses were utilized to explore the 
mediation effects of AD markers.
RESULTS: Higher rate of increase in GDS was associated with faster cognitive 
decline and higher risk of progression to MCI or AD. Moreover, the rate of 
change in GDS was significantly associated with Aβ accumulation and cerebral 
glucose metabolism. The influences of the rate of change in GDS on cognition and 
clinical progression were partially mediated by Aβ accumulation and cerebral 
glucose metabolism.
LIMITATIONS: GDS is a self-reported questionnaire and not the same as a clinical 
diagnosis of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive and clinical consequences of changes in depressive 
symptoms partly stem from Aβ accumulation and cerebral glucose metabolism, which 
increases our understanding of how depressive symptoms may increase 
vulnerability to dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with plasma tau concentrations in 
healthy elders and individuals with Alzheimer disease.
METHODS: Four hundred sixty-three non-Hispanic white individuals exceeding 
quality control criteria were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI-1) cohort. Association of plasma tau with genetic polymorphisms 
was performed with a linear regression model. Significant associations were 
validated in an independent replication cohort consisting of 431 healthy elders 
or individuals with mild cognitive impairment recruited from the University of 
California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center.
RESULTS: The minor allele (A) of rs242557 in the microtubule-associated protein 
tau gene (MAPT) was associated with higher plasma tau levels at genome-wide 
significance (p = 4.85 × 10-9, empiric family-wise error corrected p = 0.0024) 
in a dose-dependent fashion. This association was also observed in the 
replication cohort (p = 1.0 × 10-5; joint analysis p = 1.2 × 10-12). Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms near PARK2 (rs2187213) (p = 6.15 × 10-6), IL2RA 
(rs7072793, rs7073236) (p = 7.89 × 10-6), and an intergenic locus on 9p21.3 
(rs7047280) (p = 8.13 × 10-6) were identified as suggestive loci associated with 
plasma tau levels.
CONCLUSIONS: MAPT H1c haplotype (rs242557) has previously been identified as a 
genetic risk factor for progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal 
degeneration. The current findings suggest that plasma tau concentration could 
be an endophenotype for identifying risk for 4-repeat tauopathies in older 
individuals.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a well-established risk factor of amyloid-β 
(Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, because of the high prevalence of 
APOE ε3, there may be a large number of people with APOE ε3/ε3 who are 
non-demented and have Aβ pathology. There are limited studies on assessing Aβ 
status and clinical conversion in the APOE ε3/ε3 non-demented population. Two 
hundred and ninety-three non-demented individuals with APOE ε3/ε3 from ADNI 
database were divided into Aβ-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) positivity 
(+) and Aβ-PET negativity (-) groups using cut-off value of >1.11. Stepwise 
regression searched for a single or multidimensional clinical variables for 
predicting Aβ-PET (+), and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
assessed the accuracy of the predictive models. The Cox regression model 
explored the risk factors associated with clinical conversion to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD. The results showed that the combination of sex, 
education, ventricle and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume can accurately 
predict Aβ-PET status in cognitively normal (CN), and the combination of 
everyday cognition study partner total (EcogSPTotal) score, age, plasma p-tau 
181 and WMH can accurately predict Aβ-PET status in MCI individuals. EcogSPTotal 
score were independent predictors of clinical conversion to MCI or AD. The 
findings may provide a non-invasive and effective tool to improve the efficiency 
of screening Aβ-PET (+), accelerate and reduce costs of AD trial recruitment in 
future secondary prevention trials or help to select patients at high risk of 
disease progression in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) suggest the 
nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) as the origin of structural degeneration 
followed by the entorhinal cortex (EC). However, the functional properties of 
NbM and EC regarding amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau remain unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed resting-state (rs)fMRI data with CSF assays from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n=71) at baseline and two 
years later.
RESULTS: At baseline, local activity, as quantified by fractional amplitude of 
low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), differentiated between normal and abnormal 
CSF groups in the NbM but not EC. Further, NbM activity linearly decreased as a 
function of CSF ratio, resembling the disease status. Finally, NbM activity 
predicted the annual percentage signal change in EC, but not the reverse, 
independent from CSF ratio.
DISCUSSION: Our findings give novel insights into the pathogenesis of AD by 
showing that local activity in NbM is affected by proteinopathology and predicts 
functional degeneration within the EC.

Brain iron dyshomeostasis is a feature of Alzheimer's disease. Conventionally, 
research has focused on non-heme iron although degradation of heme from 
hemoglobin subunits can generate iron to augment the redox-active iron pool. 
Hemopexin both detoxifies heme to maintain iron homeostasis and bolsters 
antioxidant capacity via catabolic products, biliverdin and carbon monoxide to 
combat iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. The aim of the present study was to 
examine the association of cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) hemopexin and 
hemoglobin subunits (α and β) to Alzheimer's pathological proteins (amyloid and 
tau), hippocampal volume and metabolism, and cognitive performance. We analyzed 
baseline CSF heme/iron proteins (multiplexed mass spectrometry-based assay), 
amyloid and tau (Luminex platform), baseline/longitudinal neuroimaging (MRI, 
FDG-PET) and cognitive outcomes in 86 cognitively normal, 135 mild-cognitive 
impairment and 66 Alzheimer's participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort. Multivariate regression analysis was 
performed to delineate differences in CSF proteins between diagnosis groups and 
evaluated their association to amyloid and tau, neuroimaging and cognition. A 
p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Higher hemopexin was associated with 
higher CSF amyloid (implying decreased brain amyloid deposition), improved 
hippocampal metabolism and cognitive performance. Meanwhile, hemoglobin subunits 
were associated with increased CSF tau (implying increased brain tau 
deposition). When dichotomizing individuals with mild-cognitive impairment into 
stable and converters to Alzheimer's disease, significantly higher baseline 
hemoglobin subunits were observed in the converters compared to non-converters. 
Heme/iron dyshomeostasis is an early and crucial event in AD pathophysiology, 
which warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION: We previously reported genetic associations of the top Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) risk alleles with amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. Here, 
we report the association of these variants with [18F]flortaucipir standardized 
uptake value ratio (SUVR).
METHODS: We analyzed the [18F]flortaucipir scans of 352 cognitively normal (CN), 
160 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 54 dementia (DEM) participants from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)2 and 3. We ran step-wise 
regression with log-transformed [18F]flortaucipir meta-region of interest SUVR 
as the outcome measure and genetic variants, age, sex, and apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 as predictors. The results were visualized using parametric mapping at 
familywise error cluster-level-corrected P < .05.
RESULTS: APOE ε4 showed significant (P < .05) associations with tau deposition 
across all disease stages. Other significantly associated genes include variants 
in ABCA7 in CN, CR1 in MCI, BIN1 and CASS4 in MCI and dementia participants.
DISCUSSION: We found significant associations to tau deposition for ABCA7, BIN1, 
CASS4, and CR1, in addition to APOE ε4. These four variants have been previously 
associated with tau metabolism through model systems.

Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) measured in blood plasma has 
recently been proposed as an accessible, scalable, and highly specific biomarker 
for Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal studies, however, investigating the 
temporal dynamics of this novel biomarker are lacking. It is therefore unclear 
when in the disease process plasma p-tau181 increases above physiological levels 
and how it relates to the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's disease 
characteristic pathologies. We aimed to establish the natural time course of 
plasma p-tau181 across the sporadic Alzheimer's disease spectrum in comparison 
to those of established imaging and fluid-derived biomarkers of Alzheimer's 
disease. We examined longitudinal data from a large prospective cohort of 
elderly individuals enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) (n = 1067) covering a wide clinical spectrum from normal cognition to 
dementia, and with measures of plasma p-tau181 and an 18F-florbetapir amyloid-β 
PET scan at baseline. A subset of participants (n = 864) also had measures of 
amyloid-β1-42 and p-tau181 levels in CSF, and another subset (n = 298) had 
undergone an 18F-flortaucipir tau PET scan 6 years later. We performed 
brain-wide analyses to investigate the associations of plasma p-tau181 baseline 
levels and longitudinal change with progression of regional amyloid-β pathology 
and tau burden 6 years later, and estimated the time course of changes in plasma 
p-tau181 and other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers using a previously developed 
method for the construction of long-term biomarker temporal trajectories using 
shorter-term longitudinal data. Smoothing splines demonstrated that earliest 
plasma p-tau181 changes occurred even before amyloid-β markers reached abnormal 
levels, with greater rates of change correlating with increased amyloid-β 
pathology. Voxel-wise PET analyses yielded relatively weak, yet significant, 
associations of plasma p-tau181 with amyloid-β pathology in early accumulating 
brain regions in cognitively healthy individuals, while the strongest 
associations with amyloid-β were observed in late accumulating regions in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment. Cross-sectional and particularly 
longitudinal measures of plasma p-tau181 were associated with widespread 
cortical tau aggregation 6 years later, covering temporoparietal regions typical 
for neurofibrillary tangle distribution in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we 
estimated that plasma p-tau181 reaches abnormal levels ∼6.5 and 5.7 years after 
CSF and PET measures of amyloid-β, respectively, following similar dynamics as 
CSF p-tau181. Our findings suggest that plasma p-tau181 increases are associated 
with the presence of widespread cortical amyloid-β pathology and with 
prospective Alzheimer's disease typical tau aggregation, providing clear 
implications for the use of this novel blood biomarker as a diagnostic and 
screening tool for Alzheimer's disease.

The aim of this research was to test a novel in-vivo brain MRI analysis method 
that could be used in clinical cohorts to investigate cortical architecture 
changes in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Three cohorts of patients 
with probable AD and healthy volunteers were used to assess the results of the 
method. The first group was used as the "Discovery" cohort, the second as the 
"Test" cohort and the last "ATN" (Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration) cohort was 
used to test the method in an ADNI 3 cohort, comparing to amyloid and Tau PET. 
The method can detect altered quality of cortical grey matter in AD patients, 
providing an additional tool to assess AD, distinguishing between these and 
healthy controls with an accuracy range between good and excellent. These new 
measurements could be used within the "ATN" framework as an index of cortical 
microstructure quality and a marker of Neurodegeneration. Further development 
may aid diagnosis, patient selection, and quantification of the 
"Neurodegeneration" component in response to therapies in clinical trials.

The glymphatic system plays an important role in clearing the amyloid-β (Aβ) and 
tau proteins that are closely linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. 
Glymphatic clearance, as well as Aβ accumulation, is highly dependent on sleep, 
but the sleep-dependent driving forces behind cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
movements essential to the glymphatic flux remain largely unclear. Recent 
studies have reported that widespread, high-amplitude spontaneous brain 
activations in the drowsy state and during sleep, which are shown as large 
global signal peaks in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(rsfMRI), are coupled with CSF movements, suggesting their potential link to 
glymphatic flux and metabolite clearance. By analyzing multimodal data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, here we showed that 
the coupling between the global fMRI signal and CSF influx is correlated with 
AD-related pathology, including various risk factors for AD, the severity of 
AD-related diseases, the cortical Aβ level, and cognitive decline over a 2-year 
follow-up. These results provide critical initial evidence for involvement of 
sleep-dependent global brain activity, as well as the associated physiological 
modulations, in the clearance of AD-related brain waste.

BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) 
commonly coexist, the interaction between two has been of the considerable 
interest.
OBJECTIVE: We determined whether the association of Aβ and tau with cognitive 
decline differs by the presence of significant CSVD.
METHODS: We included 60 subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) from 
Samsung Medical Center and 82 Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment 
(ADCI) from ADNI, who underwent Aβ (florbetaben or florbetapir) and tau 
(flortaucipir, FTP) PET imaging. They were retrospectively assessed for 5.0±3.9 
and 5.6±1.9 years with Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes 
(CDR-SB)/Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mixed effects models were used to 
investigate the interaction between Aβ/tau and group on CDR-SB/MMSE changes.
RESULTS: The frequency of Aβ positivity (45% versus 54.9%, p = 0.556) and mean 
global FTP SUVR (1.17±0.21 versus 1.16±0.17, p = 0.702) were not different 
between the two groups. We found a significant interaction effect of Aβ 
positivity and SVCI group on CDR-SB increase/MMSE decrease 
(p = 0.013/p < 0.001), and a significant interaction effect of global FTP uptake 
and SVCI group on CDR-SB increase/MMSE decrease (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030). 
Finally, the interaction effects of regional tau and group were prominent in the 
Braak III/IV (p = 0.001) and V/VI (p = 0.003) not in Braak I/II region 
(p = 0.398).
CONCLUSION: The association between Aβ/tau and cognitive decline is stronger in 
SVCI than in ADCI. Therefore, our findings suggested that Aβ positivity or tau 
burden (particularly in the Braak III/IV or V/VI regions) and CSVD might 
synergistically affect cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a cascade of biomarkers becoming 
abnormal, the pathophysiology of which is very complex and largely unknown. 
Event-based modeling (EBM) is a data-driven technique to estimate the sequence 
in which biomarkers for a disease become abnormal based on cross-sectional data. 
It can help in understanding the dynamics of disease progression and facilitate 
early diagnosis and prognosis by staging patients. In this work we propose a 
novel discriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate than 
existing state-of-the-art EBM methods. The method first estimates for each 
subject an approximate ordering of events. Subsequently, the central ordering 
over all subjects is estimated by fitting a generalized Mallows model to these 
approximate subject-specific orderings based on a novel probabilistic Kendall's 
Tau distance. We also introduce the concept of relative distance between events 
which helps in creating a disease progression timeline. Subsequently, we propose 
a method to stage subjects by placing them on the estimated disease progression 
timeline. We evaluated the proposed method on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) data and compared the results with existing state-of-the-art 
EBM methods. We also performed extensive experiments on synthetic data 
simulating the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The event orderings obtained 
on ADNI data seem plausible and are in agreement with the current understanding 
of progression of AD. The proposed patient staging algorithm performed 
consistently better than that of state-of-the-art EBM methods. Event orderings 
obtained in simulation experiments were more accurate than those of other EBM 
methods and the estimated disease progression timeline was observed to correlate 
with the timeline of actual disease progression. The results of these 
experiments are encouraging and suggest that discriminative EBM is a promising 
approach to disease progression modeling.

While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady degeneration over 
relatively long timelines, it is widely believed that the early stages are the 
most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible neuronal loss 
occurs. Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease 
progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, 
obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal 
databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of 
validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational 
methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a 
disease progression score (DPS), using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a 
neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the publicly available AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, yielding an Alzheimer's DPS or ADPS score for each subject and 
each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker 
changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest 
biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of 
the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in 
the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The 
proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their 
state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common 
behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself.

Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Their Influence on 
Development and Pattern of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Later Life.

Francisco, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) are potential risk factors for the development of dementia including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. The findings of studies investigating 
this question are inconsistent though.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate if these inconsistencies are caused by the existence 
of subgroups with different vulnerability for AD pathology and if these 
subgroups are characterized by atypical tau load/atrophy pattern.
METHODS: The MRI and PET data of 89 subjects with or without previous TBI and/or 
PTSD from the DoD ADNI database were used to calculate an age-corrected gray 
matter tau mismatch metric (ageN-T mismatch-score and matrix) for each subject. 
This metric provides a measure to what degree regional tau accumulation drives 
regional gray matter atrophy (matrix) and can be used to calculate a summary 
score (score) reflecting the severity of AD pathology in an individual.
RESULTS: The ageN-T mismatch summary score was positively correlated with whole 
brain beta-amyloid load and general cognitive function but not with PTSD or TBI 
severity. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified five different spatial 
patterns of tau-gray matter interactions. These clusters reflected the different 
stages of the typical AD tau progression pattern. None was exclusively 
associated with PTSD and/or TBI.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a) although subsets of patients with

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) 
regulates blood glucose levels, facilitates hippocampal synaptic plasticity and 
may have a predictive value for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.
METHODS: IGFBP-2 levels were studied in plasma in 566 subjects and in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 245 subjects across the AD spectrum from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Variants in the IGFBP-2 gene 
were examined. Linear mixed modeling in SPSS tested main effects of IGFBP-2 and 
interactions with APOE4 on neurocognitive indices and biomarkers. Voxel-wise 
regression was used to gauge IGFBP-2 and regional grey matter and glucose 
metabolism associations.
RESULTS: Each point increase in IGFBP-2 corresponded to a three times greater 
likelihood of having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. IGFBP-2 showed 
beneficial associations with respect to cognitive scores in individuals with two 
APOE4 alleles. Higher IGFBP-2 predicted higher insulin resistance, but not CSF 
amyloid or tau. Voxel-wise analyses showed that plasma IGFBP-2 predicted lower 
grey matter volume and FDG metabolism in a large area spanning the frontal, 
temporal, and occipital lobes. CSF IGFBP-2 levels showed similar voxel-wise 
analysis results, but were uniquely associated with CSF amyloid and tau. 
Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGFBP-2 showed that 
subjects carrying risk alleles versus common alleles had increased risk of AD 
and lower memory scores. Voxel-wise analyses of these SNPs also implicated the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: IGFBP-2 is associated with AD risk and outcomes; plasma IGFBP-2 
provides stronger predictive power for brain outcomes, while CSF IGFBP-2 
provides improved predictive accuracy for AD CSF biomarkers.

Alzheimer's disease has recently been classified using three biological markers 
(amyloid [A], tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) to help elucidate its 
progression. We aimed to investigate whether there were differences between 
cognitive function and the clinical dementia symptoms over time relative to the 
ATN classification in the amyloid-negative group. In the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, 310 participants who underwent all the 
tests required for ATN classification were enrolled. The cognitive function 
score differences (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 
[ADAS-Cog 13], Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB], and Mini-Mental 
State Examination [MMSE]) between the groups were analyzed using the analysis of 
covariance and score changes over time with a linear mixed-effects model. In the 
cross-sectional analysis, ADAS-Cog 13 scores were higher for A-T-N+ and A-T+N+ 
than for A-T-N- (p<0.001) and A-T+N- (p<0.001). In the longitudinal analysis, 
CDR-SOB scores for A-T+N+ deteriorated faster than A-T-N- (p<0.001), A-T+N- 
(p<0.001) and A-T-N+ (p<0.001). Hippocampal atrophy progressed faster in A-T-N+ 
(p<0.001) and A-T+N+ (p=0.02) than in A-T-N-. Through this study, we discovered 
that even in individuals classified as amyloid negative, neurodegeneration with 
tau deposition exacerbates cognitive decline and worsens clinical symptoms, 
underscoring the need for continuous monitoring and observation.

Promising evidence has suggested potential links between mind-wandering and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, older adults with diagnosable neurocognitive 
disorders show reduced meta-awareness, thus questioning the validity of 
probe-assessed mind-wandering in older adults. In prior work, we employed 
response time variability as an objective, albeit indirect, marker of 
mind-wandering to identify patterns of functional connectivity that predicted 
mind-wandering. In the current study, we evaluated the association of this 
connectome-based, mind-wandering model with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) p-tau/Aβ 
42 ratio in 289 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Moreover, we examined if this model was similarly associated 
with individual differences in composite measures of global cognition, episodic 
memory, and executive functioning. Edges from the high response time variability 
model were significantly associated with CSF p-tau/Aβ ratio. Furthermore, 
connectivity strength within edges associated with high response time 
variability was negatively associated with global cognition and episodic memory 
functioning. This study provides the first empirical support for a link between 
an objective neuromarker of mind-wandering and AD pathophysiology. Given the 
observed association between mind-wandering and cognitive functioning in older 
adults, interventions targeted at reducing mind-wandering, particularly before 
the onset of AD pathogenesis, may make a significant contribution to the 
prevention of AD-related cognitive decline.

Plain Language Summary: Response time variability is considered an objective, 
albeit indirect, marker of mind-wandering. In this study, we applied a 
previously-derived connectome-based model of response time variability to 
resting-state data obtained from 289 older adults in the Alzheimer’s Disease 
NeuroImaging Initiative. The network strength of the high response time 
variability model was correlated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based 
ratiometric measure of amyloid and tau pathology. Additionally, our results 
demonstrated that the network strength in the high response time variability 
model was also linked with global cognition and episodic memory. This study 
provides the first empirical support for the association between a neuromarker 
of response time variability—an indirect marker of mind-wandering—and AD 
pathophysiology.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) 
distinguishes pathology-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal cognition 
(NC) adults, to test if p-tau181 predicts cognitive and functional decline, and 
to validate findings in an external cohort.
METHODS: Thirty-one neuropathology-confirmed AD cases, participants with 
clinical diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 91) or AD dementia 
(N = 64), and NC (N = 241) had plasma collected at study entry. The clinical 
diagnosis groups had annual cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) and 
functional (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, CDR) measures. NC (N = 70), MCI 
(N = 75), and AD dementia (N = 50) cases from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used as a validation cohort. Plasma p-tau181 
was measured using the Quanterix SiMoA HD-X platform.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau181 differentiated pathology-confirmed AD from NC with 
negative amyloid PET scans with an AUC of 0.93. A cut point of 3.44 pg/mL 
(maximum Youden Index) had a sensitivity of 0.77, specificity of 0.96. p-Tau181 
values above the cut point were associated with the faster rate of decline in 
MMSE in AD dementia and MCI and a shorter time to a clinically significant 
functional decline in all groups. In a subset of MCI cases from ADNI, p-tau181 
values above the cut point associated with faster rate of decline in MMSE, and a 
shorter time to a clinically significant functional decline and conversion to 
dementia.
INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau181 differentiates AD pathology cases from NC with 
high accuracy. Higher levels of plasma p-tau181 are associated with faster 
cognitive and functional decline.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using cross-sectional PET to identify 
cognitive decliners among β-amyloid (Aβ)-negative cognitively normal (CN) 
elderly adults.
METHODS: We determined the highest Aβ-affected region by ranking baseline and 
accumulation rates of florbetapir-PET regions in 355 CN elderly adults using 
18F-florbetapir-PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
The banks of the superior temporal sulcus (BANKSSTS) were found as the highest 
Aβ-affected region, and Aβ positivity in this region was defined as above the 
lowest boundary of BANKSSTS standardized uptake value ratio of Aβ+ (ADNI-defined 
COMPOSITE region) CN individuals. The entire CN cohort was divided as follows: 
stage 0, BANKSSTS-COMPOSITE-; stage 1, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE-; and stage 2, 
BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE+. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models investigated subsequent 
longitudinal cognitive change, and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET was measured 4.8 ± 
1.6 years later to track tau deposition.
RESULTS: LME analysis revealed that individuals in stage 1 (n = 64) and stage 2 
(n = 99) showed 2.5 (p < 0.05) and 4.8 (p < 0.001) times faster memory decline, 
respectively, than those in stage 0 (n = 191) over >4 years of mean follow-up. 
Compared to stage 0, both stage 1 (p < 0.05) and stage 2 (p < 0.001) predicted 
higher FTP in entorhinal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Nominally Aβ- CN individuals with high Aβ in BANKSSTS are at 
increased risk of cognitive decline, probably showing an earlier stage of Aβ 
deposition. Our findings may help elucidate the association between brain Aβ 
accumulation and cognition in Aβ- CN cohorts.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in 
elderly CN individuals those with high PET-identified superior temporal sulcus 
Aβ burden have an increased risk of cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Imaging biomarkers enable in vivo quantification of 
amyloid, tau, and neurogenerative pathologies that develop in Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD). Interest in imaging biomarkers has led to a wide variety of 
biomarker definitions, some of which potentially offer less predictive value 
than others. We aimed to assess how different operationalizations of AD imaging 
biomarkers affect prediction of cognition.
METHODS: We included individuals from ADNI who underwent amyloid-PET 
([18F]-Florbetapir), tau-PET ([18F]-Flortaucipir), and volumetric MRI imaging. 
We compiled a large collection of imaging biomarker definitions (42 in total) 
spanning different pathologies (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration) and variable 
types (continuous, binary, non-binary categorical). Using cross-validation, we 
trained regression models to predict neuropsychological performance, both 
globally and across different subdomains (Phenotype Harmonization Consortium 
composites), using different combinations of biomarkers. We also compared these 
biomarker models to support vector machines (SVMs) trained to predict cognition 
directly from imaging regions of interest. In a subsample of individuals with 
CSF biomarker readouts, we repeated experiments comparing the accuracy of models 
using imaging and fluid biomarkers. Additional analyses tested the predictive 
strength of imaging biomarkers when limited to specific clinical stages of 
disease (cognitive unimpaired vs. impaired) and when modeling longitudinal 
cognitive change.
RESULTS: Our sample included 490 people (247 female) with a mix of no impairment 
(n=288), mild impairment (n=163), and dementia (n=39). While almost all 
biomarkers tested were predictive of cognitive performance, we observed 
substantial variability in accuracy, even for measures of the same pathology. 
Tau biomarkers were the single most accurate single predictors, though 
combination of biomarkers spanning multiple pathologies were more accurate 
overall. SVM models were generally more accurate than models using traditional 
biomarkers. Incorporating continuous or non-binary categorical biomarkers was 
beneficial only for tau and neurodegeneration, but not amyloid. Patterns of 
results were largely consistent when considering different clinical stages of 
disease, neuropsychological domains, and longitudinal cognition. In the CSF 
subsample (n=246), imaging biomarkers strongly outperformed CSF versions for 
cognitive prediction.
DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that different imaging biomarker definitions can 
lead to variability in downstream predictive tasks. Researchers should consider 
how their biomarker operationalizations may help or hinder the assessment of 
disease severity.

Plasma phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) showed the potential for Alzheimer's 
diagnosis and prognosis, but its role in detecting cerebral pathologies is 
unclear. We aimed to evaluate whether it could serve as a marker for Alzheimer's 
pathology in the brain. A total of 1189 participants with plasma p-tau181 and 
PET data of amyloid, tau or FDG PET were included from ADNI. Cross-sectional 
relationships of plasma p-tau181 with PET biomarkers were tested. 
Longitudinally, we further investigated whether different p-tau181 levels at 
baseline predicted different progression of Alzheimer's pathological changes in 
the brain. We found plasma p-tau181 significantly correlated with brain amyloid 
(Spearman ρ = 0.45, P < 0.0001), tau (0.25, P = 0.0003), and FDG PET uptakes 
(-0.37, P < 0.0001), and increased along the Alzheimer's continuum. 
Individually, plasma p-tau181 could detect abnormal amyloid, tau pathologies and 
hypometabolism in the brain, similar with or even better than clinical 
indicators. The diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 elevated significantly 
when combined with clinical information (AUC = 0.814 for amyloid PET, 0.773 for 
tau PET, and 0.708 for FDG PET). Relationships of plasma p-tau181 with brain 
pathologies were partly or entirely mediated by the corresponding CSF 
biomarkers. Besides, individuals with abnormal plasma p-tau181 level 
(>18.85 pg/ml) at baseline had a higher risk of pathological progression in 
brain amyloid (HR: 2.32, 95%CI 1.32-4.08) and FDG PET (3.21, 95%CI 2.06-5.01) 
status. Plasma p-tau181 may be a sensitive screening test for detecting brain

INTRODUCTION: Alterations in locus coeruleus' (LC) metabolic turnover are 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-pathology and cognitive impairment. 
However, the evolution of these changes across disease stages and their 
functional relevance remains unknown.
METHODS: We examined associations of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) -derived LC metabolism with clinical diagnostic status, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -based AD biomarkers of AD pathology, and cognitive 
decline in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants 
(n = 604).
RESULTS: FDG-PET-derived LC metabolism was elevated in the earliest preclinical 
stages and lower in later disease stages. Higher LC metabolism was associated 
with attenuated memory decline in preclinical stages, particularly in those with 
low CSF Aβ42, but not in AD patients with cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Higher locus coeruleus [18F]-FDG-PET-derived signal in the early 
preclinical stages of AD can confer cognitive resilience and may reflect 
increased metabolic activity, whereas later stages are characterized by lower LC 
FDG-PET-derived signal, possibly due to neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: LC FDG-PET signal is lower in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. LC 
FDG-PET signal is higher in the preclinical stage of AD. We observed less memory 
decline in those with higher LC FDG-PET signal. Higher LC FDG-PET signal 
conferred cognitive resilience in preclinical AD.

The structural covariance network (SCN) has provided a perspective on the 
large-scale brain organization impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
continuum. However, the successive structural impairment across brain regions, 
which may underlie the disrupted SCN in the AD continuum, is not well 
understood. In the current study, we enrolled 446 subjects with AD, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal aging (NA) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The SCN as well as a casual SCN (CaSCN) 
based on Granger causality analysis were applied to the T1-weighted structural 
magnetic resonance images of the subjects. Compared with that of the NAs, the 
SCN was disrupted in the MCI and AD subjects, with the hippocampus and left 
middle temporal lobe being the most impaired nodes, which is in line with 
previous studies. In contrast, according to the 194 subjects with records on CSF 
amyloid and Tau, the CaSCN revealed that during AD progression, the CaSCN was 
enhanced. Specifically, the hippocampus, thalamus, and precuneus/posterior 
cingulate cortex (PCC) were identified as the core regions in which atrophy 
originated and could predict atrophy in other brain regions. Taken together, 
these findings provide a comprehensive view of brain atrophy in the AD continuum 
and the relationships among the brain atrophy in different regions, which may 
provide novel insight into the progression of AD.

BACKGROUND: A preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precedes the 
symptomatic phases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, which 
constitutes a window of opportunities for preventive therapies or delaying 
dementia onset.
NEW METHOD: We propose to use categorical predictive models based on survival 
analysis with longitudinal data which are capable of determining subsets of 
markers to classify cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects who progress into 
MCI/dementia or not. Subsequently, the proposed combination of markers was used 
to construct disease progression models (DPMs), which reveal long-term 
pathological trajectories from short-term clinical data. The proposed 
methodology was applied to a population recruited by the ADNI.
RESULTS: A very small subset of standard MRI-based data, CSF markers and 
cognitive measures was used to predict CU-to-MCI/dementia progression. The 
longitudinal data of these selected markers were used to construct DPMs using 
the algorithms of growth models by alternating conditional expectation (GRACE) 
and the latent time joint mixed effects model (LTJMM). The results show that the 
natural history of the proposed cognitive decline classifies the subjects well 
according to the clinical groups and shows a moderate correlation between the 
conversion times and their estimates by the algorithms.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Unlike the training of the DPM algorithms 
without preselection of the markers, here, it is proposed to construct and 
evaluate the DPMs using the subsets of markers defined by the categorical 
predictive models.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimates of the natural history of the proposed cognitive 
decline from GRACE were more robust than those using LTJMM. The transition from 
normal to cognitive decline is mostly associated with an increase in temporal 
atrophy, worsening of clinical scores and pTAU/Aβ. Furthermore, pTAU/Aβ, 
Everyday Cognition score and the normalized volume of the entorhinal cortex show 
alterations of more than 20% fifteen years before the onset of cognitive 
decline.

BACKGROUND: Quantifying changes in the levels of biological and cognitive 
markers prior to the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will 
provide a template for understanding the underlying aetiology of the clinical 
syndrome and, concomitantly, for improving early diagnosis, clinical trial 
recruitment and treatment assessment. This study aims to characterise continuous 
changes of such markers and determine their rate of change and temporal order 
throughout the AD continuum.
METHODS: The methodology is founded on the development of stochastic models to 
estimate the expected time to reach different clinical disease states, for 
different risk groups, and synchronise short-term individual biomarker data onto 
a disease progression timeline. Twenty-seven markers are considered, including a 
range of cognitive scores, cerebrospinal (CSF) and plasma fluid proteins, and 
brain structural and molecular imaging measures. Data from 2014 participants in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database is utilised.
RESULTS: The model suggests that detectable memory dysfunction could occur up to 
three decades prior to the onset of dementia due to AD (ADem). This is closely 
followed by changes in amyloid-β CSF levels and the first cognitive decline, as 
assessed by sensitive measures. Hippocampal atrophy could be observed as early 
as the initial amyloid-β accumulation. Brain hypometabolism starts later, about 
14 years before onset, along with changes in the levels of total and 
phosphorylated tau proteins. Loss of functional abilities occurs rapidly around 
ADem onset. Neurofilament light is the only protein with notable early changes 
in plasma levels. The rate of change varies, with CSF, memory, amyloid PET and 
brain structural measures exhibiting the highest rate before the onset of ADem, 
followed by a decline. The probability of progressing to a more severe clinical 
state increases almost exponentially with age. In accordance with previous 
studies, the presence of apolipoprotein E4 alleles and amyloid-β accumulation 
can be associated with an increased risk of developing the disease, but their 
influence depends on age and clinical state.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited longitudinal data at the individual level and 
the high variability observed in such data, the study elucidates the link 
between the long asynchronous pathophysiological processes and the preclinical 
and clinical stages of AD.

β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology is not always coupled with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
relevant cognitive decline. We assessed the accuracy of tau PET to identify 
Aβ(+) individuals who show prospective disease progression. 396 cognitively 
unimpaired and impaired individuals with baseline Aβ and tau PET and a follow-up 
of ≥ 2 years were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
dataset. The participants were dichotomously grouped based on either clinical 
conversion (i.e., change of diagnosis) or cognitive deterioration (fast (FDs) 
vs. slow decliners (SDs)) using data-driven clustering of the individual annual 
rates of cognitive decline. To assess cognitive decline in individuals with 
isolated Aβ(+) or absence of both Aβ and tau (T) pathologies, we investigated 
the prevalence of non-AD comorbidities and FDG PET hypometabolism patterns 
suggestive of AD. Baseline tau PET uptake was higher in Aβ(+)FDs than in 
Aβ(-)FD/SDs and Aβ(+)SDs, independently of baseline cognitive status. Baseline 
tau PET uptake identified MCI Aβ(+) Converters and Aβ(+)FDs with an area under 
the curve of 0.85 and 0.87 (composite temporal region of interest) respectively, 
and was linearly related to the annual rate of cognitive decline in Aβ(+) 
individuals. The T(+) individuals constituted largely a subgroup of those being 
Aβ(+) and those clustered as FDs. The most common biomarker profiles in FDs 
(n = 70) were Aβ(+)T(+) (n = 34, 49%) and Aβ(+)T(-) (n = 19, 27%). Baseline Aβ 
load was higher in Aβ(+)T(+)FDs (M = 83.03 ± 31.42CL) than in Aβ(+)T(-)FDs 
(M = 63.67 ± 26.75CL) (p-value = 0.038). Depression diagnosis was more prevalent 
in Aβ(+)T(-)FDs compared to Aβ(+)T(+)FDs (47% vs. 15%, p-value = 0.021), as were 
FDG PET hypometabolism pattern not suggestive of AD (86% vs. 50%, 
p-value = 0.039). Our findings suggest that high tau PET uptake is coupled with 
both Aβ pathology and accelerated cognitive decline. In cases of isolated Aβ(+), 
cognitive decline may be associated with changes within the AD spectrum in a 
multi-morbidity context, i.e., mixed AD.

The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is connected to the rest of the brain through two 
main networks: the anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM) systems. 
Given the crucial role of the MTL and networks in the physiopathology of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present study aimed at (1) investigating whether 
MTL atrophy propagates specifically within the AT and PM networks, and (2) 
evaluating the vulnerability of these networks to AD proteinopathies. To do 
that, we used neuroimaging data acquired in human male and female in three 
distinct cohorts: (1) resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the aging 
brain cohort (ABC) to define the AT and PM networks (n = 68); (2) longitudinal 
structural MRI from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI)GO/2 to 
highlight structural covariance patterns (n = 349); and (3) positron emission 
tomography (PET) data from ADNI3 to evaluate the networks' vulnerability to 
amyloid and tau (n = 186). Our results suggest that the atrophy of distinct MTL 
subregions propagates within the AT and PM networks in a dissociable manner. 
Brodmann area (BA)35 structurally covaried within the AT network while the 
parahippocampal cortex (PHC) covaried within the PM network. In addition, these 
networks are differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, 
with higher tau levels in AT than in PM and higher amyloid levels in PM than in 
AT. Our results also suggest differences in the relative burden of tau species. 
The current results provide further support for the notion that two distinct MTL 
networks display differential alterations in the context of AD. These findings 
have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations 
of AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current study provides further support for the 
notion that two distinct medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks, i.e., 
anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM), display differential 
alterations in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, 
neurodegeneration appears to occur within these networks in a dissociable manner 
marked by their covariance patterns. In addition, the AT and PM networks are 
also differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, and perhaps 
differences in the relative burden of tau species [e.g., neurofibriliary tangles 
(NFTs) vs tau in neuritic plaques]. These findings, in the context of a growing 
literature consistent with the present results, have important implications for 
disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD in light of the 
differential cognitive processes ascribed to them.

BACKGROUND: White matter (WM) degeneration is a key feature of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
PURPOSE: To investigate how amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and small vascular disease 
(SVD) jointly affect WM degeneration in subjects along AD continuum.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
SUBJECTS: 152 non-demented participants (age: 55.8-91.6, male/female: 66/86) 
from the ADNI database were included, classified into three groups using the A 
(Aβ)/T (tau)/N pathological scheme (Group 1: A-T-; Group 2: A+T-; Group 3: A+T+) 
based on positron emission tomography data.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T; T1-weighted images, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery images, T2*-weighted images, diffusion-weighted spin-echo 
echo-planar imaging sequence (54 diffusion directions).
ASSESSMENT: Free-water diffusion model (generated parameters: free water, FW; 
tissue fractional anisotropy, FAt; tissue mean diffusivity, MDt); SVD total 
score; Neuropsychological tests.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the 
independent contribution of AD (Aβ and tau) and SVD pathologies to diffusion 
parameters in each fiber tract, first in the entire population and then in each 
subgroup. We also investigated associations between diffusion parameters and 
cognitive functions. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 
(false discovery rate corrected).
RESULTS: In the entire population, we found that: 1) Increased FW was 
significantly associated with SVD and tau, while FAt and MDt were significantly 
associated with Aβ and tau; 2) The spatial pattern of fiber tracts related to a 
certain pathological marker is consistent with the known distribution of that 
pathology; 3) Subgroup analysis showed that Group 2 and 3 had more alterations 
of FAt and MDt associated with Aβ and tau; 4) Diffusion imaging indices showed 
significant associations with cognitive score in all domains except memory.
DATA CONCLUSION: WM microstructural injury was associated with both AD and SVD 
pathologies, showing compartment-specific, tract-specific, and stage-specific WM 
patterns.

Polypathology is a major driver of heterogeneity in clinical presentation and 
extent of neurodegeneration (N) in patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD). Beyond 
amyloid (A) and tau (T) pathologies, over half of patients with AD have 
concomitant pathology such as α-synuclein (S) in mixed AD with Lewy Body Disease 
(LBD). Patients with Mixed Etiology Dementia (MED) such as AD+LBD have faster 
progression and potentially differential responses to targeted treatments, 
though the diagnosis of AD+LBD can be challenging given overlapping clinical and 
imaging features. Development and validation of improved in vivo biomarkers are 
required to study relationships between N and S and identify imaging patterns 
reflecting mixed AD+LBD pathologies. We hypothesize that individual 
proteinopathies, such as T and S, are associated with commensurate levels of N. 
Thus, we assessed biomarkers of A, T, N and S with positron emission tomography 
(PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seeding 
amplification assay (SAA) data to determine molecular presentations of mixed 
A+S+ vs. A+S- cognitively impaired patients from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found A+S+ patients had parieto-occipital 
18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose hypometabolism (a measure of N) disproportionate to the 
degree of regional atrophy or T burden, highlighting worse hypometabolism 
associated with S+ SAA. Following up on this hypometabolic mismatch with CSF 
metabolite and proteome analyses, we found that A+S+ patients exhibited lower 
CSF levels of dopamine metabolites and synaptic markers like neuronal 
pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), suggesting that altered neurotransmission and neuron 
integrity contribute to this dissociation between metabolic PET and MRI. 
Potential confounders exist when studying relations between N, AD and LBD 
pathologies, including neuroinflammation and other non-Alzheimer pathologies in 
MED, though our findings imply posterior hypometabolic mismatch is related more 
to S than vascular or TDP-43 pathology. A+S+ patients had posterior mismatch 
with excessive 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose hypometabolism relative to atrophy or T 
load, possibly reflecting impaired neuron integrity. Further research must 
disentangle the impact of multiple proteinopathies and clinicopathologic factors 
on hypometabolism and atrophy. Cumulatively, patients with mixed AD+LBD 
etiologies harbor a unique metabolic PET mismatch signature.

IMPORTANCE: A reliable method of detecting Alzheimer disease (AD) in its 
prodromal state is needed for patient stratification in clinical trials or for 
personalizing existing or potential upcoming therapies. Current cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF)- or imaging-based single biomarkers for AD offer reliable 
identification of patients with underlying AD but insufficient prediction of the 
rate of AD progression.
OBJECTIVE: To optimize prediction of progression from mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to AD dementia by combining information from diverse patient variables.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study from the Alzheimer Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) enrolled 928 patients with MCI at baseline and 
249 selected variables available in the ADNI data set. Variables included 
clinical and demographic data, cognitive scores, magnetic resonance 
imaging-based brain volumetric data, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase 
of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) genotypes, and analyte 
levels measured in the CSF and plasma. Data were collected in July 2012 and 
analyzed from July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Progression from MCI to AD within 1 to 6 years. To 
determine whether combinations of markers could predict progression from MCI to 
AD within 1 to 6 years, the elastic net algorithm was used in an iterative 
resampling of a training- and test-based variable selection and modeling 
approach.
RESULTS: Among the 928 patients with MCI in the ADNI database, 94 had 224 of the 
required variables available for the modeling. The results showed the 
contributions of age, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes composite test 
score, hippocampal volume, and multiple plasma and CSF factors in modeling 
progression to AD. A combination of apolipoprotein A-II and cortisol levels in 
plasma and fibroblast growth factor 4, heart-type fatty acid binding protein, 
calcitonin, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 
3 (TRAIL-R3) in CSF allowed for reliable prediction of disease status 3 years 
from the time of sample collection (80% classification accuracy, 88% 
sensitivity, and 70% specificity).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These study findings suggest that a combination of 
markers measured in plasma and CSF, distinct from β-amyloid and tau, could prove 
useful in predicting midterm progression from MCI to AD dementia. Such a 
large-scale, multivariable-based analytical approach could be applied to other 
similar large data sets involving AD and beyond.

Vascular dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). While sodium is essential for maintaining vascular function, its role in 
AD pathology remains unclear. We included 353 participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), assessing serum sodium levels, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive function. An independent sample 
(N = 471) with available CSF sodium-related proteins and AD biomarkers was also 
included. Associations between serum sodium levels and AD pathology, 
neurodegeneration, and cognition were evaluated using linear regression models. 
Spearman's correlation analyses assessed the relationships between CSF 
sodium-related proteins and AD biomarkers. Higher serum sodium levels were 
associated with increased AD pathology, reduced hippocampal volume, and greater 
cognitive decline (all p < 0.05). The relationship between serum sodium and 
amyloid PET was evident in several AD-susceptible brain regions, including the 
neocortex and limbic system. Individuals with high serum sodium exhibited higher 
tau pathology, lower hippocampal volume, and more severe cognitive decline per 
unit increase in amyloid PET compared to those with low serum sodium (all 
p < 0.05). Among the 14 CSF sodium-related proteins, which were 
inter-correlated, six were significantly correlated with CSF AD pathology and 
amyloid PET, while two were correlated with hippocampal volume and cognitive 
function, with sodium channel subunit beta-2 (SCN2B) and sodium channel subunit 
beta-3 (SCN3B) showing the strongest correlations. These findings underscore the 
crucial role of serum sodium in AD progression, highlighting a potential network 
of sodium dysregulation involved in AD pathology. Targeting sodium may offer a 
novel therapeutic approach to slowing AD progression, particularly by impeding 
the progression of amyloid-related downstream events.

Whilst cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) 
biomarkers for amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies are accurate for the diagnosis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), their broad implementation in clinical and trial 
settings are restricted by high cost and limited accessibility. Plasma 
phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) is a promising blood-based biomarker that is 
specific for AD, correlates with cerebral Aβ and tau pathology, and predicts 
future cognitive decline. In this study, we report the performance of p-tau181 
in >1000 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), including cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and AD dementia patients characterized by Aβ PET. We confirmed that plasma 
p-tau181 is increased at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer and further 
increases in MCI and AD dementia. Individuals clinically classified as AD 
dementia but having negative Aβ PET scans show little increase but plasma 
p-tau181 is increased if CSF Aβ has already changed prior to Aβ PET changes. 
Despite being a multicenter study, plasma p-tau181 demonstrated high diagnostic 
accuracy to identify AD dementia (AUC = 85.3%; 95% CI, 81.4-89.2%), as well as 
to distinguish between Aβ- and Aβ+ individuals along the Alzheimer's continuum 
(AUC = 76.9%; 95% CI, 74.0-79.8%). Higher baseline concentrations of plasma 
p-tau181 accurately predicted future dementia and performed comparably to the 
baseline prediction of CSF p-tau181. Longitudinal measurements of plasma 
p-tau181 revealed low intra-individual variability, which could be of potential 
benefit in disease-modifying trials seeking a measurable response to a 
therapeutic target. This study adds significant weight to the growing body of 
evidence in the use of plasma p-tau181 as a non-invasive diagnostic and 
prognostic tool for AD, regardless of clinical stage, which would be of great 
benefit in clinical practice and a large cost-saving in clinical trial 
recruitment.

INTRODUCTION: The genetic pathways that influence longitudinal heterogeneous 
changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide insight into disease mechanisms 
and potential therapeutic targets.
METHODS: Longitudinal endophenotypes from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) representing amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration (A/T/N), and 
cognition were selected. Genome-wide association analysis was performed using a 
linear mixed model (LMM) approach, followed by gene and pathway enrichment with 
significant and functionally relevant SNPs.
RESULTS: A total of 33 and 19 statistically significant pathways were identified 
associating with the intercept and longitudinal trajectory, respectively. The 
longitudinal intercept pathways represent eight groups: immune, metabolic, cell 
growth and survival, DNA maintenance, neuronal signaling, 
RAS/MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, vesicle and lysosomal transport, and 
transcription modification. Longitudinal trajectory pathways represented six 
groups: Immune, metabolic, cell signaling, cytoskeleton, and glycosylation.
DISCUSSION: Longitudinal enrichment identified pathways that uniquely associate 
with trajectories of key AD biomarkers and cognition, providing new insight into 
AD course-related mechanisms and potential new therapeutic targets.
HIGHLIGHTS: A systematic genome-wide analysis with longitudinal AD biomarker 
endophenotypes was performed. Enriched pathways were identified with 
functionally derived SNP to gene analysis. Fifty-two pathways were associated 
with longitudinal trajectory and intercept. Many of the identified pathways are 
specific steps in larger pathways implicated in AD. The identified pathways may 
provide therapeutic targets and areas for further study.

INTRODUCTION: In 2013, the ALzheimer's and FAmilies (ALFA) project was 
established to investigate pathophysiological changes in preclinical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and to foster research on early detection and preventive 
interventions.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive genetic characterization of ALFA 
participants with respect to neurodegenerative/cerebrovascular diseases, AD 
biomarkers, brain endophenotypes, risk factors and aging biomarkers. We placed 
particular emphasis on amyloid/tau status and assessed gender differences. 
Multiple polygenic risk scores were computed to capture different aspects of 
genetic predisposition. We additionally compared AD risk in ALFA to that across 
the full disease spectrum from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI).
RESULTS: Results show that the ALFA project has been successful at establishing 
a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals at high genetic predisposition of 
AD.
DISCUSSION: It is, therefore, well-suited to study early pathophysiological 
changes in the preclinical AD continuum. Highlights Prevalence of ε4 carriers in 
ALzheimer and FAmilies (ALFA) is higher than in the general European population 
The ALFA study is highly enriched in Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk 
factors beyond APOE AD genetic profiles in ALFA are similar to clinical groups 
along the continuum ALFA has succeeded in establishing a cohort of cognitively 
unimpaired individuals at high genetic AD risk ALFA is well suited to study 
pathogenic events/early pathophysiological changes in AD.

Genome-wide association studies have identified many loci associated with 
Alzheimer's dementia. However, these variants only explain part of the 
heritability of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As genetic epistasis can be a major 
contributor to the "missing heritability" of AD, we conducted genome-wide 
epistasis screening for AD pathologies in 2 independent cohorts. First, we 
performed a genome-wide epistasis study of AD-related brain pathologies (Nmax = 
1318) in ROS/MAP. Candidate interactions were validated using cerebrospinal 
fluid biomarkers of AD in ADNI (Nmax = 1128). Further functional analysis tested 
the association of candidate interactions with neuroimaging phenotypes. For tau 
and amyloid-β pathology, we identified 2803 and 464 candidate SNP-SNP 
interactions, respectively. Associations of candidate SNP-SNP interactions with 
brain volume and white matter changes from neuroimages provides additional 
insights into their molecular functions. Transcriptional analysis supported 
possible gene-gene interactions identified by statistical screening through 
their co-expression in the brain. In summary, we outlined an exhaustive 
epistasis analysis to identify novel genetic interactions with potential roles 
in AD pathologies. We further delved into the functional relevance of candidate 
interactions by association with neuroimaging phenotypes and analysis of 
co-expression between corresponding gene pairs.

INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers remain mostly unavailable for non-Alzheimer's disease 
neuropathological changes (non-ADNC) such as transactive response DNA-binding 
protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy, Lewy body disease (LBD), and cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (CAA).
METHODS: A multilabel non-ADNC classifier using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
signatures was developed for TDP-43, LBD, and CAA in an autopsy-confirmed cohort 
(N = 214).
RESULTS: A model using demographic, genetic, clinical, MRI, and ADNC variables 
(amyloid positive [Aβ+] and tau+) in autopsy-confirmed participants showed 
accuracies of 84% for TDP-43, 81% for LBD, and 81% to 93% for CAA, outperforming 
reference models without MRI and ADNC biomarkers. In an ADNI cohort (296 
cognitively unimpaired, 401 mild cognitive impairment, 188 dementia), Aβ and tau 
explained 33% to 43% of variance in cognitive decline; imputed non-ADNC 
explained an additional 16% to 26%. Accounting for non-ADNC decreased the 
required sample size to detect a 30% effect on cognitive decline by up to 28%.
DISCUSSION: Our results lead to a better understanding of the factors that 
influence cognitive decline and may lead to improvements in AD clinical trial 
design.

Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a 
neuropathologically-defined disease that affects 40% of persons in advanced age, 
but its associated neurological syndrome is not defined. LATE neuropathological 
changes (LATE-NC) are frequently comorbid with Alzheimer's disease 
neuropathologic changes (ADNC). When seen in isolation, LATE-NC have been 
associated with a predominantly amnestic profile and slow clinical progression. 
We propose a set of clinical criteria for a limbic-predominant amnestic 
neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS) that is highly associated with LATE-NC but 
also other pathologic entities. The LANS criteria incorporate core, standard and 
advanced features that are measurable in vivo, including older age at 
evaluation, mild clinical syndrome, disproportionate hippocampal atrophy, 
impaired semantic memory, limbic hypometabolism, absence of neocortical 
degenerative patterns and low likelihood of neocortical tau, with degrees of 
certainty (highest, high, moderate, low). We operationalized this set of 
criteria using clinical, imaging and biomarker data to validate its associations 
with clinical and pathologic outcomes. We screened autopsied patients from Mayo 
Clinic (n = 922) and ADNI (n = 93) cohorts and applied the LANS criteria to 
those with an antemortem predominant amnestic syndrome (Mayo, n = 165; ADNI, n = 
53). ADNC, ADNC/LATE-NC and LATE-NC accounted for 35%, 37% and 4% of cases in 
the Mayo cohort, respectively, and 30%, 22%, and 9% of cases in the ADNI cohort, 
respectively. The LANS criteria effectively categorized these cases, with ADNC 
having the lowest LANS likelihoods, LATE-NC patients having the highest 
likelihoods, and ADNC/LATE-NC patients having intermediate likelihoods. A 
logistic regression model using the LANS features as predictors of LATE-NC 
achieved a balanced accuracy of 74.6% in the Mayo cohort, and out-of-sample 
predictions in the ADNI cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 73.3%. Patients 
with high LANS likelihoods had a milder and slower clinical course and more 
severe temporo-limbic degeneration compared to those with low likelihoods. 
Stratifying ADNC/LATE-NC patients from the Mayo cohort according to their LANS 
likelihood revealed that those with higher likelihoods had more temporo-limbic 
degeneration and a slower rate of cognitive decline, and those with lower 
likelihoods had more lateral temporo-parietal degeneration and a faster rate of 
cognitive decline. The implementation of LANS criteria has implications to 
disambiguate the different driving etiologies of progressive amnestic 
presentations in older age and guide prognosis, treatment, and clinical trials. 
The development of in vivo biomarkers specific to TDP-43 pathology are needed to 
refine molecular associations between LANS and LATE-NC and precise antemortem 
diagnoses of LATE.

INTRODUCTION: Pathological and neuroimaging alterations in the cerebellum of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have been documented. However, the role of 
cerebellum-derived radiomic and structural connectome modeling in the prediction 
of AD progression remains unclear.
METHODS: Radiomic features were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 1319) and 
an in-house dataset (n = 308). Integrated machine learning models were developed 
to predict the conversion risk of normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) over a 6-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The cerebellar models outperformed hippocampal models in distinguishing 
MCI from NC and in predicting transitions from NC to MCI across both cohorts. 
Key predictors included textural features in the right III and left I and II 
lobules, and network properties in Vermis I and II, which were associated with 
cognitive decline in AD.
DISCUSSION: Cerebellum-derived radiomic-network modeling shows promise as a tool 
for early identification and prediction of disease progression during the 
preclinical stage of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Altered cerebellar radiomic features and topological networks were 
identified in the subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The cerebellar 
radiomic-network integrated models outperformed hippocampal models in 
distinguishing MCI from normal cognition. The cerebellar radiomic model 
effectively predicts MCI risk and can stratify individuals into distinct risk 
categories. Specific cerebellar radiomic features are associated with cognitive 
impairment across various stages of amyloid beta and tau pathology.

The underlying genetic susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not yet 
fully understood. The heterogeneous nature of the disease challenges genetic 
association studies. Endophenotype approaches can help to address this challenge 
by more direct interrogation of biological traits related to the disease. AD 
endophenotypes based on amyloid-β, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers 
and cognitive performance were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 1565). A genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) of quantitative phenotypes was performed using an SNP main effect 
and an SNP by Diagnosis interaction (SNP × DX) model to identify disease 
stage-specific genetic effects. Nine loci were identified as study-wide 
significant with one or more A/T/N endophenotypes in the main effect model, as 
well as additional findings significantly associated with cognitive measures. 
These nine loci include SNPs in or near the genes APOE, SRSF10, HLA-DQB1, XKR3, 
and KIAA1671. The SNP × DX model identified three study-wide significant genetic 
loci (BACH2, EP300, and PACRG-AS1) with a neuroprotective effect in later AD 
stage endophenotypes. An endophenotype approach identified novel genetic 
associations and provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
genetic associations that may otherwise be missed using conventional 
case-control study designs.

BACKGROUND: Large-scale neuronal network breakdown underlies memory impairment 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the differential trajectories of the 
relationships between network organisation and memory across pathology and 
cognitive stages in AD remain elusive. We determined whether and how the 
influences of individual-level structural and metabolic covariance network 
integrity on memory varied with amyloid pathology across clinical stages without 
assuming a constant relationship.
METHODS: Seven hundred and eight participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative were studied. Individual-level structural and metabolic 
covariance scores in higher-level cognitive and hippocampal networks were 
derived from magnetic resonance imaging and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography using seed-based partial least square analyses. The 
non-linear associations between network scores and memory across cognitive 
stages in each pathology group were examined using sparse varying coefficient 
modelling.
RESULTS: We showed that the associations of memory with structural and metabolic 
networks in the hippocampal and default mode regions exhibited 
pathology-dependent differential trajectories across cognitive stages using 
sparse varying coefficient modelling. In amyloid pathology group, there was an 
early influence of hippocampal structural network deterioration on memory 
impairment in the preclinical stage, and a biphasic influence of the angular 
gyrus-seeded default mode metabolic network on memory in both preclinical and 
dementia stages. In non-amyloid pathology groups, in contrast, the trajectory of 
the hippocampus-memory association was opposite and weaker overall, while no 
metabolism covariance networks were related to memory. Key findings were 
replicated in a larger cohort of 1280 participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight potential windows of early intervention 
targeting network breakdown at the preclinical AD stage.

Misfolded proteins (MP) are a key component in aging and associated 
neurodegenerative disorders. For example, misfolded Amyloid-ß (Aß) and tau 
proteins are two neuropathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanisms 
underlying intra-brain MP propagation/deposition remain essentially 
uncharacterized. Here, is introduced an epidemic spreading model (ESM) for MP 
dynamics that considers propagation-like interactions between MP agents and the 
brain's clearance response across the structural connectome. The ESM reproduces 
advanced Aß deposition patterns in the human brain (explaining 46∼56% of the 
variance in regional Aß loads, in 733 subjects from the ADNI database). 
Furthermore, this model strongly supports a) the leading role of Aß clearance 
deficiency and early Aß onset age during Alzheimer's disease progression, b) 
that effective anatomical distance from Aß outbreak region explains regional Aß 
arrival time and Aß deposition likelihood, c) the multi-factorial impact of APOE 
e4 genotype, gender and educational level on lifetime intra-brain Aß 
propagation, and d) the modulatory impact of Aß propagation history on tau 
proteins concentrations, supporting the hypothesis of an interrelated pathway 
between Aß pathophysiology and tauopathy. To our knowledge, the ESM is the first 
computational model highlighting the direct link between structural brain 
networks, production/clearance of pathogenic proteins and associated 
intercellular transfer mechanisms, individual genetic/demographic properties and 
clinical states in health and disease. In sum, the proposed ESM constitutes a 
promising framework to clarify intra-brain region to region transference 
mechanisms associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
complex and still not well understood. We aimed to examine the roles of the AD 
core pathologies in modulating the associations of minimal depressive symptoms 
(MDSs) with cognitive impairments.
METHODS: A total of 721 participants who had measures of cognition, depressive 
symptoms, and cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers were included from the CABLE 
(Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE) study. Causal mediation analyses 
with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations were conducted to explore the mediation 
effects of AD pathologies on cognition. The ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative) was used 1) to replicate the mediation effects and 2) 
to examine the longitudinal relationships of MDSs with amyloid pathology and 
incident AD risk.
RESULTS: In CABLE, MDSs were associated with poorer global cognition (p = .006) 
and higher amyloid burden as indicated by cerebrospinal fluid amyloid markers (p 
< .0001). The influence of MDSs on cognition was partially mediated by amyloid 
pathology (a maximum of 85%). The mediation effects were replicated in 725 
elderly persons without dementia (age, mean ± SD = 73.5 ± 6.9 years; 301 female 
subjects [42%]) in ADNI, such that the mediation percentage varied from 10% to 
30% for general cognition, memory, and executive functions. Longitudinal 
analyses revealed a bidirectional relationship between MDSs and amyloid 
pathology (p = .01). MDSs were associated with 83% increased risk of developing 
AD dementia (hazard ratio = 1.83, p < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, amyloid pathology might partially mediate and magnify the 
influences of MDSs on cognitive impairments and AD risk.

The 3D tortuosity determined in several brain areas is proposed as a new 
morphological biomarker (BM) to be considered in early detection of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). It is measured using the sum of angles method and it has proven to 
be sensitive to anatomical changes that appear in gray and white matter and 
temporal and parietal lobes during mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Statistical 
analysis showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between tortuosity indices 
determined for healthy controls (HC) vs. MCI and HC vs. AD in most of the 
analyzed structures. Other clinically used BMs have also been incorporated in 
the analysis: beta-amyloid and tau protein CSF and plasma concentrations, as 
well as other image-extracted parameters. A classification strategy using random 
forest (RF) algorithms was implemented to discriminate between three samples of 
the studied populations, selected from the ADNI database. Classification rates 
considering only image-extracted parameters show an increase of 9.17%, when 
tortuosity is incorporated. An enhancement of 1.67% is obtained when BMs 
measured from several modalities are combined with tortuosity.

The relationship between mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is intricate and still not well investigated. The purpose of the 
study is to examine the roles of the AD imaging pathologies in modulating the 
associations of MBI with cognitive impairments. We analyzed 1129 participants 
(563 [49.86%] female), who had measures of Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire (NPI-Q), cognition, and amyloid PET AD biomarkers from the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We assess the longitudinal 
neuropathological and clinical correlates of baseline MBI via linear mixed 
effects and Cox proportional hazard models. The mediation analyses were used to 
test the mediation effects of AD pathologies on cognition. We found that MBI was 
associated with worse global cognition as represented by Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) (p < 0.001), and higher β-amyloid burden (p < 0.001). 
β-amyloid partially mediated the effects of MBI on cognition with the mediation 
percentage varied from 14.67 to 40.86% for general cognition, memory, executive, 
and language functions for non-dementia individuals. However, no significant 
associations were discovered between MBI and tau burden or neurodegeneration. 
Furthermore, longitudinal analyses revealed that individuals with MBI had a 
faster increase in brain amyloid burden (p < 0.001) and a higher risk of 
clinical conversion (HR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.45 to 4.01 p < 0.001). In conclusion, 
MBI could be an imperative prediction indicator of clinical and pathological 
progression. In addition, amyloid pathologies might partially mediate the 
influences of MBI on cognitive impairments and AD risk.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes, although the detailed mechanism through 
which all these genes are associated with AD pathogenesis remains unknown. We 
comprehensively evaluate the roles of the variants in top 30 non-APOE AD risk 
genes, based on whether these variants were associated with altered mRNA 
transcript levels, as well as brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, and 
neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Human brain gene expression data were obtained from the UK Brain 
Expression Consortium (UKBEC), while other data used in our study were obtained 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We examined 
the association of AD risk allele carrier status with the levels of gene 
expression in blood and brain regions and tested the association with brain 
amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration at baseline, using a multivariable 
linear regression model. Next, we analyzed the longitudinal effects of these 
variants on the change rates of pathology using a mixed effect model.
RESULTS: Altogether, 27 variants were detected to be associated with the altered 
expression of 21 nearby genes in blood and brain regions. Eleven variants 
(especially novel variants in ADAM10, IGHV1-68, and SLC24A4/RIN3) were 
associated with brain amyloidosis, 7 variants (especially in INPP5D, PTK2B) with 
brain tauopathy, and 8 variants (especially in ECHDC3, HS3ST1) with brain 
neurodegeneration. Variants in ADAMTS1, BZRAP1-AS1, CELF1, CD2AP, and 
SLC24A4/RIN3 participated in more than one cerebral pathological process.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants might play functional roles and suggest potential 
mechanisms in AD pathogenesis, which opens doors to uncover novel targets for AD 
treatment.

OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) may involve oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a 
circulating protein that intersects both these pathways, since its expression is 
increased during the acute phase response, and the protein acts to lower 
pro-oxidant iron in cells. Since the role of Cp in AD, and its potential for use 
as a biomarker is not established, we investigated CSF Cp and its association 
with longitudinal outcome measures related to AD.
METHODS: This was an observational study of 268 people from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) cohort. Subjects were classified clinically as 
having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or were cognitively normal (CN), and 
were also classified as being positive for β-amyloid using established 
thresholds in the CSF t-tau/Aβ42 ratio. Subjects underwent cognitive tests and 
MRI studies every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly thereafter for up to 
6 years.
RESULTS: At baseline, CSF Cp was not associated with clinical or pathological 
diagnosis, but we found an unexpected association between CSF Cp and levels of 
CSF apolipoprotein E. In longitudinal analysis, high level of CSF Cp was 
associated with accelerated cognitive decline (as assessed by ADAS-Cog, CDR-SB, 
and MMSE) and ventricular volume enlargement in people classified as MCI and who 
had underlying β-amyloid pathology.
CONCLUSION: These results raise new questions into the role of Cp in 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and APOE pathways involved in AD, and 
reveal the potential for this protein to be used as a biomarker in disease 
prognostication.

BACKGROUND: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) usually precedes the symptomatic 
phase of dementia and constitutes a window of opportunities for preventive 
therapies.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to predict the time an MCI patient 
has left to reach dementia and obtain the most likely natural history in the 
progression of MCI towards dementia.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 633 MCI patients and 145 subjects with 
dementia through 4726 visits over 15 years from Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort. A combination of data from AT(N) profiles at baseline 
and longitudinal predictive modeling was applied. A data-driven approach was 
proposed for categorical diagnosis prediction and timeline estimation of 
cognitive decline progression, which combined supervised and unsupervised 
learning techniques.
RESULTS: A reduced vector of only neuropsychological measures was selected for 
training the models. At baseline, this approach had high performance in 
detecting subjects at high risk of converting from MCI to dementia in the coming 
years. Furthermore, a Disease Progression Model (DPM) was built and also 
verified using three metrics. As a result of the DPM focused on the studied 
population, it was inferred that amyloid pathology (A+) appears about 7 years 
before dementia, and tau pathology (T+) and neurodegeneration (N+) occur almost 
simultaneously, between 3 and 4 years before dementia. In addition, MCI-A+ 
subjects were shown to progress more rapidly to dementia compared to MCI-A- 
subjects.
CONCLUSION: Based on proposed natural histories and cross-sectional and 
longitudinal analysis of AD markers, the results indicated that only a single 
cerebrospinal fluid sample is necessary during the prodromal phase of AD. 
Prediction from MCI into dementia and its timeline can be achieved exclusively 
through neuropsychological measures.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) into plaques, aggregation of tau into neurofibrillary tangles, 
and neurodegenerative processes including atrophy. However, there is a poorly 
understood spatial discordance between initial Aβ deposition and local 
neurodegeneration.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we test the hypothesis that the cingulum bundle links Aβ 
deposition in the cingulate cortex to medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy.
METHODS: 21 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the UMC 
Utrecht memory clinic (UMCU, discovery sample) and 37 participants with MCI from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, replication sample) with 
available Aβ-PET scan, T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI were included. Aβ 
load of the cingulate cortex was measured by the standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR), white matter integrity of the cingulum bundle was assessed by mean 
diffusivity and atrophy of the MTL by normalized MTL volume. Relationships were 
tested with linear mixed models, to accommodate multiple measures for each 
participant.
RESULTS: We found at most a weak association between cingulate Aβ and MTL volume 
(added R2 &lt;0.06), primarily for the posterior hippocampus. In neither sample, 
white matter integrity of the cingulum bundle was associated with cingulate Aβ 
or MTL volume (added R2 &lt;0.01). Various sensitivity analyses (Aβ-positive 
individuals only, posterior cingulate SUVR, MTL sub region volume) provided 
similar results.
CONCLUSION: These findings, consistent in two independent cohorts, do not 
support our hypothesis that loss of white matter integrity of the cingulum is a 
connecting factor between cingulate gyrus Aβ deposition and MTL atrophy.

BACKGROUND: Temporary disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using pulsed 
ultrasound leads to the clearance of both amyloid and tau from the brain, 
increased neurogenesis, and mitigation of cognitive decline in pre-clinical 
models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) while also increasing BBB penetration of 
therapeutic antibodies. The goal of this pilot clinical trial was to investigate 
the safety and efficacy of this approach in patients with mild AD using an 
implantable ultrasound device.
METHODS: An implantable, 1-MHz ultrasound device (SonoCloud-1) was implanted 
under local anesthesia in the skull (extradural) of 10 mild AD patients to 
target the left supra-marginal gyrus. Over 3.5 months, seven ultrasound sessions 
in combination with intravenous infusion of microbubbles were performed twice 
per month to temporarily disrupt the BBB. 18F-florbetapir and 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were performed 
on a combined PET/MRI scanner at inclusion and at 4 and 8 months after the 
initiation of sonications to monitor the brain metabolism and amyloid levels 
along with cognitive evaluations. The evolution of cognitive and neuroimaging 
features was compared to that of a matched sample of control participants taken 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: A total of 63 BBB opening procedures were performed in nine subjects. 
The procedure was well-tolerated. A non-significant decrease in amyloid 
accumulation at 4 months of - 6.6% (SD = 7.2%) on 18F-florbetapir PET imaging in 
the sonicated gray matter targeted by the ultrasound transducer was observed 
compared to baseline in six subjects that completed treatments and who had 
evaluable imaging scans. No differences in the longitudinal change in the 
glucose metabolism were observed compared to the neighboring or contralateral 
regions or to the change observed in the same region in ADNI participants. No 
significant effect on cognition evolution was observed in comparison with the 
ADNI participants as expected due to the small sample size and duration of the 
trial.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the safety of ultrasound-based BBB 
disruption and the potential of this technology to be used as a therapy for AD 
patients. Research of this technique in a larger clinical trial with a device 
designed to sonicate larger volumes of tissue and in combination with 
disease-modifying drugs may further enhance the effects observed.

Cardiovascular risk could be calculated using Qrisk2. It is suggested that 
cardiovascular risk factors influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, studies have not specifically evaluated the influence of 
cardiovascular risk using Qrisk2 on neuropathological progression and AD 
biomarkers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of cardiovascular 
risk factors using Qrisk2 on CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, 18F-AV45-PET, 
18F-FDG-PET, MRI, and cognitive measures in APOE4 negative cognitively normal 
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. 614 cognitively normal, early, and 
late MCI subjects were selected from the ADNI cohort with a 2-year follow-up. 
CSF Aβ and tau, 18F-AV45-PET, 18F-FDG-PET, MRI, and cognitive measures along 
with modified Qrisk2 were evaluated. APOE4 non-carrier, high cardiovascular risk 
sub-group of early and late MCI and cognitively normal subjects, demonstrated 
worse biomarker and cognitive profile at baseline and during follow up compared 
to low cardiovascular risk group. Additionally, similar pattern was also 
observed in APOE4 carriers. We demonstrated that Qrisk2 and APOE4 were 
independent predictors of biomarker and clinical progression in AD trajectory. 
High cardiovascular risk is associated with biomarker changes in APOE4 
non-carriers in prodromal AD, which may suggest that treatment of cardiovascular 
risk is an effective prevention strategy even in APOE4 negative subjects and may 
influence disease progression independent of amyloid pathology. Demonstration of 
accelerated neuropathological changes in both APOE4 carriers and non-carriers 
suggest that focusing on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is an effective 
preventative strategy while we eagerly waiting for new treatments.

BACKGROUND: Localized regions of left-right image intensity asymmetry (LRIA) 
were incidentally observed on T2 -weighted (T2 -w) and T1 -weighted (T1 -w) 
diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Suspicion of herpes 
encephalitis resulted in unnecessary follow-up imaging. A nonbiological imaging 
artifact that can lead to diagnostic uncertainty was identified.
PURPOSE: To investigate whether systematic LRIA exist for a range of scanner 
models and to determine if LRIA can introduce diagnostic uncertainty.
STUDY TYPE: A retrospective study using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) data base.
SUBJECTS: One thousand seven hundred fifty-three (median age: 72, males/females: 
878/875) unique participants with longitudinal data were included.
FIELD STRENGTH: 3T.
SEQUENCES: T1 -w three-dimensional inversion-recovery spoiled gradient-echo 
(IR-SPGR) or magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) and T2 -w 
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) long tau fast spin echo inversion 
recovery (LT-FSE-IR). Only General Electric, Philips, and Siemens' product 
sequences were used.
ASSESSMENT: LRIA was calculated as the left-right percent difference with 
respect to the mean intensity from automated anatomical atlas segmented regions. 
Three neuroradiologists with 37 (**), 32 (**), and 3 (**) years of experience 
rated the clinical impact of 30 T2 -w three-dimensional FLAIR exams with LRIA to 
determine the diagnostic uncertainty. Statistical comparisons between 
retrospective intensity normalized T1 m and original T1 -w images were made.
STATISTICAL TESTS: For each image type, a linear mixed effects model was fit 
using LRIA scores from all scanners, regions, and participants as the outcome 
and age and sex as predictors. Statistical significance was defined as having a 
P-value <0.05.
RESULTS: LRIA scores were significantly different from zero on most scanners. 
All clinicians were uncertain or recommended definite diagnostic follow-up in 
62.5% of cases with LRIA >10%. Individuals with acute brain pathology or focal 
neurologic deficits are not enrolled in ADNI; therefore, focal signal 
abnormalities were considered false positives.
DATA CONCLUSION: LRIA is system specific, systematic, creates diagnostic 
uncertainty, and impacts IR-SPGR, MP-RAGE, and LT-FSE-IR product sequences.

OBJECTIVE: To study risk factors for decreasing aβ1-42 concentrations in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cognitively unimpaired individuals with initially 
normal amyloid and tau markers, and to investigate whether such aβ1-42 decreases 
are associated with subsequent decline in cognition and other biomarkers of 
Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Cognitively normal subjects (n = 83, 75 ± 5 years, 35(42%) female) with 
normal CSF aβ1-42 and tau and repeated CSF sampling were selected from ADNI. 
Subject level slopes of aβ1-42 decreases were estimated with mixed models. We 
tested associations of baseline APP processing markers (BACE1 activity, aβ1-40, 
aβ1-38 and sAPP β) and decreasing aβ1-42 levels by including an interaction term 
between time and APP marker. Associations between decreasing aβ1-42 levels and 
clinical decline (i.e., progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, 
MMSE, memory functioning) and biological decline (tau, hippocampal volume, 
glucose processing and amyloid PET) over a time period of 8-10 years were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Aβ1-42 levels decreased annually with -4.6 ± 1 pg/mL. Higher baseline 
BACE1 activity (β(se) = -0.06(0.03), P < 0.05), aβ1-40 (β(se)= -0.11(.03), P < 
0.001), and aβ1-38 levels (β(se) = -0.11(0.03), P < 0.001) predicted faster 
decreasing aβ1-42. The fastest tertile of decreasing aβ1-42 rates was associated 
with subsequent pathophysiological processes: 11(14%) subjects developed 
abnormal amyloid levels after 3 ± 1.7 years, showed increased risk for clinical 
progression (Hazard Ratio[95CI] = 4.8[1.1-21.0]), decreases in MMSE, glucose 
metabolism and hippocampal volume, and increased CSF tau and amyloid aggregation 
on PET (all P < 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: Higher APP processing and fast decreasing aβ1-42 could be among 
the earliest, pre-amyloid, pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease.

Objective: To delineate the relationship between clinical symptoms and tauopathy 
of the hippocampal subfields under different amyloid statuses. Methods: One 
hundred and forty-three subjects were obtained from the ADNI project, including 
87 individuals with normal cognition, 46 with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). All subjects underwent the tau PET, amyloid PET, 
T1W, and high-resolution T2W scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale cognition 13 (ADAS-cog-13) total score, comprising memory and executive 
function scores. The hippocampal subfields including Cornu Ammonis (CA1-3), 
subiculum (Sub), and dentate gyrus (DG), as well as the adjacent 
para-hippocampus (PHC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC), were segmented automatically 
using the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software. The 
relationship between tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal subfields and 
assessment scores was calculated using partial correlation analysis under 
different amyloid status, by controlling age, gender, education, apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) allele ɛ4 carrier status, and, time interval between the acquisition 
time of tau PET and amyloid PET scans. Results: Compared with amyloid negative 
(A-) group, individuals from amyloid positive (A+) group are more impaired based 
on the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE; p = 3.82e-05), memory (p = 
6.30e-04), executive function (p = 0.0016), and ADAS-cog-13 scores (p = 
5.11e-04). Significant decrease of volume (CA1, DG, and Sub) and increase of tau 
deposition (CA1, Sub, ERC, and PHC) of the hippocampal subfields of both 
hemispheres were observed for the A+ group compared to the A- group. Tauopathy 
of ERC is significantly associated with memory score for the A- group, and the 
associated regions spread into Sub and PHC for the A+ group. The relationship 
between the impairment of behavior or executive function and tauopathy of the 
hippocampal subfield was discovered within the A+ group. Leftward asymmetry was 
observed with the association between assessment scores and tauopathy of the 
hippocampal subfield, which is more prominent for the NPI score for the A+ 
group. Conclusion: The associations of tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal 
subfields with clinical symptoms provide additional insight into the 
understanding of local changes of the human HF during the AD continuum and can 
be used as a reference for future studies.

Mounting evidences have shown that progression of white matter hyperintensities 
(WMHs) with vascular origin might cause cognitive dysfunction symptoms through 
their effects on brain networks. However, the vulnerability of specific neural 
connection related to WMHs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) still remains unclear. In 
this study, we established an atlas-guided computational framework based on 
brain disconnectome to assess the spatial-temporal patterns of WMH-related 
structural disconnectivity within a longitudinal investigation. Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was adopted with 91, 90 and 44 
subjects including in cognitive normal aging, stable and progressive mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), respectively. The parcel-wise disconnectome was 
computed by indirect mapping of individual WMHs onto population-averaged 
tractography atlas. By performing chi-square test, we discovered a 
spatial-temporal pattern of brain disconnectome along AD evolution. When applied 
such pattern as predictor, our models achieved highest mean accuracy of 0.82, 
mean sensitivity of 0.86, mean specificity of 0.82 and mean area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 for predicting conversion 
from MCI to dementia, which outperformed methods utilizing lesion volume as 
predictors. Our analysis suggests that brain WMH-related structural 
disconnectome contributes to AD evolution mainly through attacking connections 
between: (1) parahippocampal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, orbital gyrus, 
and lateral occipital cortex; and (2) hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, which are 
also vulnerable to Aβ and tau confirmed by other researches. All the results 
further indicate that a synergistic relationship exists between multiple 
contributors of AD as they attack similar brain connectivity at the prodromal 
stage of disease.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
are both important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to 
investigate whether a T2DM-specific polygenic risk score (PRS sT2DM ) can 
predict the conversion of aMCI to AD and further explore the underlying 
neurological mechanism. All aMCI patients were from the Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and were divided into conversion 
(aMCI-C, n = 164) and stable (aMCI-S, n = 222) groups. PRS sT2DM was calculated 
by PRSice-2 software to explore the predictive efficacy of the aMCI conversion 
to AD. We found that PRS sT2DM could independently predict the aMCI conversion 
to AD after removing the common variants of these two diseases. PRS sT2DM was 
significantly negatively correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) of the right 
superior frontal gyrus in the aMCI-C group. In all aMCI patients, PRS sT2DM was 
significantly negatively correlated with the cortical volume of the right 
superior occipital gyrus. The cortical volume of the right superior occipital 
gyrus could significantly mediate the association between PRS sT2DM and aMCI 
conversion. Gene-based analysis showed that T2DM-specific genes are highly 
expressed in cortical neurons and involved in ion and protein binding, neural 
development and generation, cell junction and projection, and PI3K-Akt and MAPK 
signaling pathway, which might increase the aMCI conversion by affecting the Tau 
phosphorylation and amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation. Therefore, the PRS sT2DM 
could be used as a measure to predict the conversion of aMCI to AD.

In addition to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, α-synuclein, best known for its role in 
Parkinson's disease (PD), has been suggested to be involved in cognition and 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigate the potential of 
α-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a biomarker of cognitive decline in 
AD, and its prodromal phase, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using an 
established, sensitive Luminex assay, we measured α-synuclein levels in the CSF 
of a cohort of close to 400 healthy control, MCI, and AD subjects obtained from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and factored in APOE 
genotype in data analysis. CSF α-synuclein levels were significantly higher in 
the MCI (p = 0.005) and AD (p < 0.001) groups, compared to controls. However, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggests that CSF 
α-synuclein level on its own only offered modest sensitivity (65%) and 
specificity (74%) as a diagnostic marker of AD, with an area under the curve 
(AUC) value of 0.719 for AD versus controls. The effect of APOE genotype, if 
any, was quite subtle. However, there was a significant correlation between 
α-synuclein and cognition (p = 0.001), with increased α-synuclein levels 
associated with decreased Mini-Mental State Exam scores. Our results support a 
role for α-synuclein even in MCI, the early phase of AD, in addition to being a 
potential contributor in MCI and AD diagnosis or monitoring of disease 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement activation is a key part of 
neuroinflammation that occurs in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the associations of CSF complement proteins with AD pathology, 
cognition, and structural neuroimaging biomarkers for AD have been rarely 
investigated.
METHODS: A total of 210 participants (125 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] 
patients and 85 normal controls) were included from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database who measured AD pathology, cognition, 
and neuroimaging at baseline and every 12 months. The mixed-effect linear models 
were utilized to investigate longitudinal associations of CSF complement 
proteins with AD pathology, cognition, and neuroimaging in cognitively normal 
(CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Causal mediation analyses 
were conducted to explore the potential mediators between CSF complement 
proteins and cognitive changes.
RESULTS: We found that the subjects with low CSF complement protein levels at 
baseline had worse outcomes in AD pathology, indicated by their lowest 
concentrations observed in A + and A + T + individuals. The reduced CSF 
complement proteins were associated with faster accumulation of tau among CN 
subjects and with cognitive decline and greater brain atrophy of specific 
regions among MCI subjects. Furthermore, mediation analyses showed that the 
effects of CSF complement proteins on cognitive performance were partially 
mediated by regional brain structures (mediation proportions range from 19.78 to 
94.92%; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that CSF complement proteins were involved 
in the early progression of AD. Our results indicated that regional brain 
atrophy might be a plausible way to connect CSF complement protein levels and 
cognition.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairments that hinder 
daily activities and lead to personal and behavioral problems. Plasma 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein at threonine 181 (p-tau181) has recently emerged 
as a new sensitive tool for the diagnosis of AD patients. We herein investigated 
the association of plasma P-tau181 and white matter (WM) microstructural changes 
in AD. We obtained data from a large prospective cohort of elderly individuals 
participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which 
included baseline measurements of plasma P-tau181 and imaging findings. A subset 
of 41 patients with AD, 119 patients with mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and 
43 healthy controls (HC) was included in the study, all of whom had baseline 
blood P-tau181 levels and had also undergone Diffusion Tensor Imaging. The 
analysis revealed that the plasma level of P-tau181 has a positive correlation 
with changes in Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and Axial 
Diffusivity (AxD), but a negative with Fractional Anisotropy (FA) parameters in 
WM regions of all participants. There is also a significant association between 
WM microstructural changes in different regions and P-tau181 plasma measurements 
within each MCI, HC, and AD group. In conclusion, our findings clarified that 
plasma P-tau181 levels are associated with changes in WM integrity in AD. 
P-tau181 could improve the accuracy of diagnostic procedures and support the 
application of blood-based biomarkers to diagnose WM neurodegeneration. 
Longitudinal clinical studies are also needed to demonstrate the efficacy of the 
P-tau181 biomarker and predict its role in structural changes.

BACKGROUND: Progranulin is an anti-inflammatory protein that plays an essential 
role in the synapse function and the maintenance of neurons in the central 
nervous system (CNS). It has been shown that the CSF level of progranulin 
increases in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and is associated with the 
deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau in the brain tissue. In this study, we 
aimed to assess the longitudinal changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
progranulin levels during different pathophysiological stages of AD and 
investigate associated AD pathologic features.
METHODS: We obtained the CSF and neuroimaging data of 1001 subjects from the 
ADNI database. The participants were classified into four groups based on the 
A/T/N framework: A + /TN + , A + /TN-, A-/TN + , and A-/TN-.
RESULTS: Based on our analysis there was a significant difference in CSF 
progranulin (P = 0.001) between ATN groups. Further ANOVA analysis revealed that 
there was no significant difference in the rate of change of CSF-progranulin ATN 
groups. We found that the rate of change of CSF progranulin was associated with 
baseline Aβ-PET only in the A-/TN + group. A significant association was found 
between the rate of change of CSF progranulin and the Aβ-PET rate of change only 
in A-/TN +  CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that an increase in CSF 
progranulin over time is associated with faster formation of Aβ plaques in 
patients with only tau pathology based on the A/T/N classification (suspected 
non-Alzheimer's pathology). Together, our findings showed that the role of 
progranulin-related microglial activity on AD pathology can be stage-dependent, 
complicated, and more prominent in non-AD pathologic changes. Thus, there is a 
need for further studies to consider progranulin-based therapies for AD 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (ATN) framework was proposed to 
identify the preclinical biological state of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
investigated whether ATN phenotype can be predicted using routinely collected 
research cohort data.
METHODS: 927 EPAD LCS cohort participants free of dementia or Mild Cognitive 
Impairment were separated into 5 ATN categories. We used machine learning (ML) 
methods to identify a set of significant features separating each 
neurodegeneration-related group from controls (A-T-(N)-). Random Forest and 
linear-kernel SVM with stratified 5-fold cross validations were used to optimize 
model whose performance was then tested in the ADNI database.
RESULTS: Our optimal results outperformed ATN cross-validated logistic 
regression models by between 2.2% and 8.3%. The optimal feature sets were not 
consistent across the 4 models with the AD pathologic change vs controls set 
differing the most from the rest. Because of that we have identified a subset of 
10 features that yield results very close or identical to the optimal.
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates the gains offered by ML in generating ATN 
risk prediction over logistic regression models among pre-dementia individuals.

IMPORTANCE: Longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a relevant 
outcome in clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer 
disease (AD). A key unanswered question is whether the use of 
participant-specific (individualized) regions of interest (ROIs) is superior to 
conventional approaches where the same ROI (group-level) is used for each 
participant.
OBJECTIVE: To compare group- and participant-level ROIs in participants at 
different stages of the AD clinical continuum in terms of annual percentage 
change in tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and sample size 
requirements.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a longitudinal cohort study with 
consecutive participant enrollment between September 18, 2017, and November 15, 
2021. Included in the analysis were participants with mild cognitive impairment 
and AD dementia from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish Biomarkers For 
Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably 2 (BioFINDER-2) 
study; in addition, a validation sample (the AVID 05e, Expedition-3, Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], and BioFINDER-1 study cohorts) was also 
included.
EXPOSURES: Tau PET (BioFINDER-2, [18F]RO948; validation sample, 
[18F]flortaucipir), 7 group-level (5 data-driven stages, meta-temporal, whole 
brain), and 5 individualized ROIs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual percentage change in tau-PET SUVR across 
ROIs. Sample size requirements in simulated clinical trials using tau PET as an 
outcome were also calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 215 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.4 (7.5) years; 111 male 
[51.6%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study were included in this analysis: 97 amyloid-β 
(Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 77 with Aβ-positive mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 41 with AD dementia. In the validation sample 
were 137 Aβ-positive CU participants, 144 with Aβ-positive MCI, and 125 with AD 
dementia. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.8 (0.3) years. Using group-level ROIs, 
the largest annual percentage increase in tau-PET SUVR in Aβ-positive CU 
individuals was seen in a composite ROI combining the entorhinal cortex, 
hippocampus, and amygdala (4.29%; 95% CI, 3.42%-5.16%). In individuals with 
Aβ-positive MCI, the greatest change was seen in the temporal cortical regions 
(5.82%; 95% CI, 4.67%-6.97%), whereas in those with AD dementia, the greatest 
change was seen in the parietal regions (5.22%; 95% CI, 3.95%-6.49%). 
Significantly higher estimates of annual percentage change were found using 
several of the participant-specific ROIs. Importantly, the simplest 
participant-specific approach, where change in tau PET was calculated in an ROI 
that best matched the participant's data-driven disease stage, performed best in 
all 3 subgroups. For the power analysis, sample size reductions for the 
participant-specific ROIs ranged from 15.94% (95% CI, 8.14%-23.74%) to 72.10% 
(95% CI, 67.10%-77.20%) compared with the best-performing group-level ROIs. 
Findings were replicated using [18F]flortaucipir.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Finding suggest that certain individualized ROIs 
carry an advantage over group-level ROIs for assessing longitudinal tau changes 
and increase the power to detect treatment effects in AD clinical trials using 
longitudinal tau PET as an outcome.

In the United States, estimates indicate there are between 250,000 and 400,000 
individuals with Down syndrome (DS), and nearly all will develop Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathology starting in their 30s. With the current lifespan being 55 
to 60 years, approximately 70% will develop dementia, and if their life 
expectancy continues to increase, the number of individuals developing AD will 
concomitantly increase. Pathogenic and mechanistic links between DS and 
Alzheimer's prompted the Alzheimer's Association to partner with the Linda Crnic 
Institute for Down Syndrome and the Global Down Syndrome Foundation at a 
workshop of AD and DS experts to discuss similarities and differences, 
challenges, and future directions for this field. The workshop articulated a set 
of research priorities: (1) target identification and drug development, (2) 
clinical and pathological staging, (3) cognitive assessment and clinical trials, 
and (4) partnerships and collaborations with the ultimate goal to deliver 
effective disease-modifying treatments.

The brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have three 
classical pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, and 
neurodegeneration, including that of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. 
However the relationship between Aβ burden and basal forebrain degeneration has 
not been extensively studied. To investigate this association, basal forebrain 
volumes were determined from magnetic resonance images of controls, subjects 
with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients enrolled in the 
longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Australian 
Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) studies. In the AIBL cohort, these 
volumes were correlated within groups to neocortical gray matter retention of 
Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) from positron emission tomography images as a 
measure of Aβ load. The basal forebrain volumes of AD and aMCI subjects were 
significantly reduced compared to those of control subjects. Anterior basal 
forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in AD 
subjects and aMCI subjects with high Aβ burden, whereas posterior basal 
forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in 
control subjects with high Aβ burden. Therefore this study provides new evidence 
for a correlation between neocortical Aβ accumulation and basal forebrain 
degeneration. In addition, cluster analysis showed that subjects with a whole 
basal forebrain volume below a determined cut-off value had a 7 times higher 
risk of having a worse diagnosis within ~18 months.

The clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranges dynamically from 
asymptomatic and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild, moderate, or severe 
AD. Although a few disease-modifying treatments, such as lecanemab and 
donanemab, have been developed, current therapies can only delay disease 
progression rather than halt it entirely. Therefore, the early detection of MCI 
and the identification of MCI patients at high risk of progression to AD remain 
urgent unmet needs in the super-aged era. This study utilized transcriptomics 
data from cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, MCI, and AD patients in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and leveraged machine 
learning models to identify biomarkers that differentiate MCI from CU and also 
distinguish AD from MCI individuals. Furthermore, Cox proportional hazards 
analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers predictive of the progression from 
MCI to AD. Our machine learning models identified a unique set of gene 
expression profiles capable of achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 
in distinguishing those with MCI from CU individuals. A subset of these 
biomarkers was also found to be significantly associated with the risk of 
progression from MCI to AD. A linear mixed model demonstrated that plasma tau 
phosphorylated at threonine 181 (pTau181) and neurofilament light chain (NFL) 
exhibit the prognostic value in predicting cognitive decline longitudinally. 
These findings underscore the potential of integrating machine learning (ML) 
with transcriptomic profiling in the early detection and prognostication of AD. 
This integrated approach could facilitate the development of novel diagnostic 
tools and therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying or preventing the onset of AD 
in at-risk individuals. Future studies should focus on validating these 
biomarkers in larger, independent cohorts and further investigating their roles 
in AD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate feasible gray matter microstructural 
biomarkers with high sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection. 
We propose a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measure, "radiality", as an early AD 
biomarker. It is the dot product of the normal vector of the cortical surface 
and primary diffusion direction, which reflects the fiber orientation within the 
cortical column.
METHODS: We analyzed neuroimages from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, including images from 78 cognitively normal (CN), 50 
early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 34 late mild cognitive impairment 
(LMCI), and 39 AD patients. We then evaluated the cortical thickness (CTh), mean 
diffusivity (MD), which are conventional AD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
biomarkers, and the amount of accumulated amyloid and tau using positron 
emission tomography (PET). Radiality was projected on the gray matter surface to 
compare and validate the changes with different stages alongside other 
neuroimage biomarkers.
RESULTS: The results revealed decreased radiality primarily in the entorhinal, 
insula, frontal, and temporal cortex with further progression of disease. In 
particular, radiality could delineate the difference between the CN and EMCI 
groups, while the other biomarkers could not. We examined the relationship 
between radiality and other biomarkers to validate its pathological evidence in 
AD. Overall, radiality showed a high association with conventional biomarkers. 
Additional ROI analysis revealed the dynamics of AD-related changes as stages 
onward.
CONCLUSION: Radiality in cortical gray matter showed AD-specific changes and 
relevance with other conventional AD biomarkers with high sensitivity. Moreover, 
radiality could identify the group differences seen in EMCI, representative of 
changes in early AD, which supports its superiority in early diagnosis compared 
to that possible with conventional biomarkers. We provide evidence of structural 
changes with cognitive impairment and suggest radiality as a sensitive biomarker 
for identifying early AD.

BACKGROUND: Higher late-life body mass index (BMI) was associated with reduced 
risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which might be explained by a reverse causal 
relationship.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether weight loss was a preclinical manifestation of 
AD pathologies and could be a predictor of cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A total of 1,194 participants (mean age = 73.2 [range: 54 to 91] years, 
female = 44.5%) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were 
grouped according to AD biomarker profile as indicated by amyloid (A) and tau 
(TN) status and clinical stage by clinical dementia rating (CDR). BMI across the 
biomarker-defined clinical stages was compared with Bonferroni correction. 
Pearson correlation analysis was performed to test the relationship between the 
amyloid change by PET and the BMI change. Multiple regression models were used 
to explore the influences of amyloid pathologies on BMI change as well as the 
effects of weight loss on longitudinal changes of global cognitive function.
RESULTS: BMI was significantly decreased in AD preclinical stage (amyloid 
positive [A+] and CDR = 0) and dementia stage (A+/TN+ and CDR = 0.5 or 1), 
compared with the healthy controls (A-/TN-and CDR = 0, p < 0.005), while no 
significant differences were observed between preclinical AD and AD dementia. 
Amyloid PET change was inversely correlated with BMI change (p = 0.023, β= -14). 
Individuals in amyloid positive group exhibited faster weight loss (time×group 
interaction p = 0.019, β= -0.20) compared to the amyloid negative group. Greater 
weight loss predicted higher risk of developing cognitive disorders.
CONCLUSION: Elders who experienced greater weight loss might belong to 
preclinical stage of AD and could be targeted for primary prevention of the 
disease.

BACKGROUND: An integrative model of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the risk factors, anatomy, biology, 
and outcomes of NPS in AD.
METHODS: 181 subjects were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Study (ADNI). NPS were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire at baseline and 6 months. NPI >3 was used as a threshold for NPS 
positivity. Three NPS courses were characterized: 1) minimal/absent (negative at 
0 and 6 months, n = 77); 2) fluctuating (positive only at one time point, 
n = 53); 3) persistent (positive at both time points, n = 51). We examined the 
association between NPS course and family history of dementia, personal history 
of psychiatric disorders, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, atrophy patterns, as 
well as longitudinal cognitive and functional measures at 12 and 24 months 
(MMSE, CDR-SOB, FAQ).
RESULTS: AD subjects with absent, fluctuating, or persistent NPS had similar CSF 
amyloid-β and tau levels. AD subjects with minimal/absent NPS had less personal 
history of psychiatric disorders (35%) than those with fluctuating (57%; 
p = 0.015) or persistent NPS (47%, not significant). At 24 months, AD subjects 
with persistent NPS had worse cognitive (MMSE; p = 0.05) and functional 
(CDR-SOB; p = 0.016) outcomes. Dorsolateral prefrontal atrophy was seen in 
persistent NPS, but not in fluctuating NPS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that individuals with personal history of 
psychiatric disorders might be more vulnerable to develop NPS throughout the 
course of AD. The worst cognitive and functional outcomes associated with NPS in 
AD underscores the importance of monitoring NPS early in the disease course.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify modularized structural atrophy of brain regions 
with a high degree of connectivity and its longitudinal changes associated with 
the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA), which is an unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
method originally used in genetic analysis.
METHODS: We included participants with late mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at 
baseline from the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) 
study. We imputed normalized and Z-transformed structural volume or cortical 
thickness data of 164 parcellated brain regions/structures based on the 
calculations of the FreeSurfer software. We applied the WGCNA to extract modules 
with highly interconnected structural atrophic patterns and examined the 
correlation between the identified modules and clinical AD progression.
RESULTS: We included 204 participants from the baseline dataset, and performed a 
follow-up with 100 in the 36-month dataset of MCI cohort participants from the 
J-ADNI. In the univariate correlation or variable importance analysis, baseline 
atrophy in temporal lobe regions/structures significantly predicted clinical AD 
progression. In the WGCNA consensus analysis, co-atrophy modules associated with 
MCI conversion were first distributed in the temporal lobe and subsequently 
extended to adjacent parietal cortical regions in the following 36 months.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified coordinated modules of brain atrophy and demonstrated 
their longitudinal extension along with the clinical course of AD progression 
using WGCNA, which showed a good correspondence with previous pathological 
studies of the tau propagation theory. Our results suggest the potential 
applicability of this methodology, originating from genetic analyses, for the 
surrogate visualization of the underlying pathological progression in 
neurodegenerative diseases not limited to AD.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH) and cognitive domains such as memory and executive 
function (EF) across different clinical and biomarker categories of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 216 cognitively normal (CN) participants and 407 
participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Based on the 2018 research framework, participants were classified 
using AT(N) (amyloid-β deposition [A], pathologic tau [T], and neurodegeneration 
[(N)]) biomarkers into one of three categories: biomarker negative 
[A - T- (N)-], amyloid negative but other biomarker positive [A - T ± (N)+ or 
A - T + (N)±] or amyloid positive [A + T ± (N)±]. Linear regression models were 
then used to examine the association between WMH and memory composite scores and 
EF composite scores.
RESULTS: Higher WMH burden was associated with worse EF in both CN and MCI 
subgroups while a significant association between WMH and memory was only found 
in the MCI subgroup. Furthermore, WMH was associated with EF in the group with 
A - T ± (N)+ or A - T + (N)± biomarker category, but not for A - T - (N)- 
(normal biomarker) and A + T ± (N) ± (AD pathology). The association between 
higher WMH and worse memory was independent of amyloid levels in individuals 
with MCI with evidence of AD pathology.
CONCLUSION: Vascular disease, as indexed by WMH, independent of AD pathology 
affects cognitive function in both CN and MCI subgroups. Future studies using 
the AT(N) research framework should consider white matter lesions as a key 
biomarker contributing to the clinical presentation of AD.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and 
clinical and cognitive characteristics of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
in a Japanese population to effectively design and conduct future preventive 
trials on preclinical AD.
METHODS: Three-year longitudinal data from cognitively normal participants who 
underwent cerebrospinal fluid biomarker measurement and/or amyloid positron 
emission tomography in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 
were analyzed. Comparisons between participants with and without amyloid β (Aβ) 
accumulation, and between those with and without elevated tau levels tau among 
participants with Aβ accumulation were performed.
RESULTS: Among 84 participants with available cerebrospinal fluid biomarker 
and/or amyloid positron emission tomography data, 19 (22.6%) exhibited Aβ 
accumulation. The frequency of APOE ε4 alleles was significantly higher in 
participants with Aβ accumulation. There were no significant differences in any 
of the cognitive tests at the baseline; however, participants with Aβ 
accumulation exhibited a decline in clock drawing test (linear mixed-effects 
model, P = .008) and a tendency toward loss of practice effects in the 
Mini-Mental State Examination and the logical memory over time. Although it did 
not reach statistical significance, the analysis indicated a decline in 
measurements of executive function over time in participants with elevated tau 
levels compared with those with normal tau levels.
DISCUSSION: The frequency of preclinical AD in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative was lower than in similar studies because of the younger 
age of the participants and lower frequency of APOE ε4 carriage. Although 
limitations in sample size precluded definitive conclusions, the results suggest 
that even in the preclinical phase of AD, loss of practice effects in episodic 
memory tests and at a later stage, decline in executive function, are present. 
These findings may be useful for recruitment of individuals with preclinical AD 
and establishing a novel cognitive composite for use in clinical trials on 
preclinical AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with 
the abnormal deposition of pathological processes, such as amyloid-ß and tau, 
which produces nonlinear changes in the functional connectivity patterns between 
different brain regions across the Alzheimer's disease continuum. However, the 
mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes remain largely unknown. Here, we 
address this question using a novel method based on temporal or delayed 
correlations and calculate new whole-brain functional networks to tackle these 
mechanisms.
METHODS: To assess our method, we evaluated 166 individuals from the ADNI 
database, including amyloid-beta negative and positive cognitively normal 
subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer's 
disease dementia. We used the clustering coefficient and the global efficiency 
to measure the functional network topology and assessed their relationship with 
amyloid and tau pathology measured by positron emission tomography, as well as 
cognitive performance using tests measuring memory, executive function, 
attention, and global cognition.
RESULTS: Our study found nonlinear changes in the global efficiency, but not in 
the clustering coefficient, showing that the nonlinear changes in functional 
connectivity are due to an altered ability of brain regions to communicate with 
each other through direct paths. These changes in global efficiency were most 
prominent in early disease stages. However, later stages of Alzheimer's disease 
were associated with widespread network disruptions characterized by changes in 
both network measures. The temporal delays required for the detection of these 
changes varied across the Alzheimer's disease continuum, with shorter delays 
necessary to detect changes in early stages and longer delays necessary to 
detect changes in late stages. Both global efficiency and clustering coefficient 
showed quadratic associations with pathological amyloid and tau burden as well 
as cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that global efficiency is a more sensitive 
indicator of network changes in Alzheimer's disease when compared to clustering 
coefficient. Both network properties were associated with pathology and 
cognitive performance, demonstrating their relevance in clinical settings. Our 
findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying nonlinear changes in 
functional network organization in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that it is 
the lack of direct connections that drives these functional changes.

After the paper Cognition or genetics. Predicting progression to Alzheimer's 
disease with practice effects, APOE genotype and brain metabolism [Neurobiol 
Aging, 2018; 71:234-240] was published, we identified a coding error of one of 
the variables analyzed. To correct, update and expand the previous work, we 
compared simple and complex regression-based Reliable Change Index (RCIRB) to 
analyze the risk of progression to AD (AD-risk) after six years using either 
delayed recall or recognition scores. Auditory Verbal Learning Test scores at 
six months for 394 individuals with normal cognition from the ADNI were used to 
build the regression. In 816 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive 
impairments, the AD-risk was associated with age, brain metabolism, APOE-ε4, 
recognition hits, the discrimination index, and low practice effects in the 
complex RCIRB only. The complex RCIRB outperformed the simple RCIRB. Small 
correlations were found between practice effects and both Aβ (highest r = 0.218) 
and TAU (highest r = -0.183). RCIRB are computationally simple and provide 
sensitive AD-risk estimates in combination with APOE-ε4 and FDG-PET.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning models promise to support diagnostic predictions, 
but may not perform well in new settings. Selecting the best model for a new 
setting without available data is challenging. We aimed to investigate the 
transportability by calibration and discrimination of prediction models for 
cognitive impairment in simulated external settings with different distributions 
of demographic and clinical characteristics.
METHODS: We mapped and quantified relationships between variables associated 
with cognitive impairment using causal graphs, structural equation models, and 
data from the ADNI study. These estimates were then used to generate datasets 
and evaluate prediction models with different sets of predictors. We measured 
transportability to external settings under guided interventions on age, APOE 
ε4, and tau-protein, using performance differences between internal and external 
settings measured by calibration metrics and area under the receiver operating 
curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Calibration differences indicated that models predicting with causes of 
the outcome were more transportable than those predicting with consequences. AUC 
differences indicated inconsistent trends of transportability between the 
different external settings. Models predicting with consequences tended to show 
higher AUC in the external settings compared to internal settings, while models 
predicting with parents or all variables showed similar AUC.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated with a practical prediction task example that 
predicting with causes of the outcome results in better transportability 
compared to anti-causal predictions when considering calibration differences. We 
conclude that calibration performance is crucial when assessing model 
transportability to external settings.

INTRODUCTION: Brain imaging genetics aims to explore the genetic architecture 
underlying brain structure and functions. Recent studies showed that the 
incorporation of prior knowledge, such as subject diagnosis information and 
brain regional correlation, can help identify significantly stronger imaging 
genetic associations. However, sometimes such information may be incomplete or 
even unavailable.
METHODS: In this study, we explore a new data-driven prior knowledge that 
captures the subject-level similarity by fusing multi-modal similarity networks. 
It was incorporated into the sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) model, 
which is aimed to identify a small set of brain imaging and genetic markers that 
explain the similarity matrix supported by both modalities. It was applied to 
amyloid and tau imaging data of the ADNI cohort, respectively.
RESULTS: Fused similarity matrix across imaging and genetic data was found to 
improve the association performance better or similarly well as diagnosis 
information, and therefore would be a potential substitute prior when the 
diagnosis information is not available (i.e., studies focused on healthy 
controls).
DISCUSSION: Our result confirmed the value of all types of prior knowledge in 
improving association identification. In addition, the fused network 
representing the subject relationship supported by multi-modal data showed 
consistently the best or equally best performance compared to the diagnosis 
network and the co-expression network.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 are known to cause familial 
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) but common variants in PSEN1 have not 
been found to strongly influence late-onset AD (LOAD). The association of rare 
variants in PSEN1 with LOAD-related endophenotypes has received little 
attention. In this study, we performed a rare variant association analysis of 
PSEN1 with quantitative biomarkers of LOAD using whole genome sequencing (WGS) 
by integrating bioinformatics and imaging informatics.
METHODS: A WGS data set (N = 815) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort was used in this analysis. 757 non-Hispanic Caucasian 
participants underwent WGS from a blood sample and high resolution T1-weighted 
structural MRI at baseline. An automated MRI analysis technique (FreeSurfer) was 
used to measure cortical thickness and volume of neuroanatomical structures. We 
assessed imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as LOAD-related 
quantitative endophenotypes. Single variant analyses were performed using PLINK 
and gene-based analyses of rare variants were performed using the optimal 
Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O).
RESULTS: A total of 839 rare variants (MAF < 1/√(2 N) = 0.0257) were found 
within a region of ±10 kb from PSEN1. Among them, six exonic (three 
non-synonymous) variants were observed. A single variant association analysis 
showed that the PSEN1 p. E318G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in 
participants carrying APOE ε4 allele where individuals carrying the minor allele 
of this PSEN1 risk variant have lower CSF Aβ1-42 and higher CSF tau. A 
gene-based analysis resulted in a significant association of rare but not common 
(MAF ≥ 0.0257) PSEN1 variants with bilateral entorhinal cortical thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that PSEN1 rare variants 
collectively show a significant association with the brain atrophy in regions 
preferentially affected by LOAD, providing further support for a role of PSEN1 
in LOAD. The PSEN1 p. E318G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in APOE ε4 
carriers. Integrating bioinformatics with imaging informatics for identification 
of rare variants could help explain the missing heritability in LOAD.

Alzheimer's Disease-resemblance atrophy index (AD-RAI) is an MRI-based machine 
learning derived biomarker that was developed to reflect the characteristic 
brain atrophy associated with AD. Recent study showed that AD-RAI (≥0.5) had the 
best performance in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
to dementia and from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to MCI. We aimed to validate 
the performance of AD-RAI in detecting preclinical and prodromal AD. We 
recruited 128 subjects (MCI=50, CU=78) from two cohorts: CU-SEEDS and ADNI. 
Amyloid (A+) and tau (T+) status were confirmed by PET (11C-PIB, 18F-T807) or 
CSF analysis. We investigated the performance of AD-RAI in detecting preclinical 
and prodromal AD (i.e. A+T+) among MCI and CU subjects and compared its 
performance with that of hippocampal measures. AD-RAI achieved the best metrics 
among all subjects (sensitivity 0.74, specificity 0.91, accuracy 85.94%) and 
among MCI subjects (sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.81, accuracy 86.00%) in 
detecting A+T+ subjects over other measures. Among CU subjects, AD-RAI yielded 
the best specificity (0.95) and accuracy (85.90%) over other measures, while 
hippocampal volume achieved a higher sensitivity (0.73) than AD-RAI (0.47) in 
detecting preclinical AD. These results showed the potential of AD-RAI in the 
detection of early AD, in particular at the prodromal stage.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) frequently occur in Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) and have a contribution from ischemia, though their relationship with 
β-amyloid and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) is not completely understood. 
We used AT classification to categorize individuals based on their β-amyloid and 
tau pathologies, then assessed the effects of β-amyloid and tau on WMH volume 
and number. We then determined regions in which β-amyloid and WMH accumulation 
were related. Last, we analyzed the effects of various CVRFs on WMHs. As 
secondary analyses, we observed effects of age and sex differences, atrophy, 
cognitive scores, and APOE genotype. PET, MRI, FLAIR, demographic, and 
cardiovascular health data was collected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) (N = 287, 48 % male). Participants were 
categorized as A + and T + if their Florbetapir SUVR and Flortaucipir SUVR were 
above 0.79 and 1.25, respectively. WMHs were mapped on MRI using a deep 
convolutional neural network (Sepehrband et al., 2020). CVRF scores were based 
on history of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, 
respiration rate, BMI, and a cumulative score with 6 being the maximum score. 
Regression models and Pearson correlations were used to test associations and 
correlations between variables, respectively, with age, sex, years of education, 
and scanner manufacturer as covariates of no interest. WMH volume percent was 
significantly associated with global β-amyloid (r = 0.28, p < 0.001), but not 
tau (r = 0.05, p = 0.25). WMH volume percent was higher in individuals with 
either A + or T + pathology compared to controls, particularly within in the 
A+/T + group (p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.4, t = -2.5). Individual CVRFs nor 
cumulative CVRF scores were associated with increased WMH volume. Finally, the 
regions where β-amyloid and WMH count were most positively associated were the 
middle temporal region in the right hemisphere (r = 0.18, p = 0.002) and the 
fusiform region in the left hemisphere (r = 0.017, p = 0.005). β-amyloid and WMH 
have a clear association, though the mechanism facilitating this association is 
still not fully understood. The associations found between β-amyloid and WMH 
burden emphasizes the relationship between β-amyloid and vascular lesion 
formation while factors like CVRFs, age, and sex affect AD development through 
various mechanisms. These findings highlight potential causes and mechanisms of 
AD as targets for future preventions and treatments. Going forward, a larger 
emphasis may be placed on β-amyloid's vascular effects and the implications of 
impaired brain clearance in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in 
progressive cognitive decline but without any clinically validated cures so far. 
Understanding the progression of AD is critical for early detection and risk 
assessment for AD in aging individuals, thereby enabling initiation of timely 
intervention and improved chance of success in AD trials. Recent pseudotime 
approach turns cross-sectional data into "faux" longitudinal data to understand 
how a complex process evolves over time. This is critical for Alzheimer, which 
unfolds over the course of decades, but the collected data offers only a 
snapshot. In this study, we tested several state-of-the-art pseudotime 
approaches to model the full spectrum of AD progression. Subsequently, we 
evaluated and compared the pseudotime progression score derived from individual 
imaging modalities and multi-modalities in the ADNI cohort. Our results showed 
that most existing pseudotime analysis tools do not generalize well to the 
imaging data, with either flipped progression score or poor separation of 
diagnosis groups. This is likely due to the underlying assumptions that only 
stand for single cell data. From the only tool with promising results, it was 
observed that all pseudotime, derived from either single imaging modalities or 
multi-modalities, captures the progressiveness of diagnosis groups. Pseudotime 
from multi-modality, but not the single modalities, confirmed the hypothetical 
temporal order of imaging phenotypes. In addition, we found that multi-modal 
pseudotime is mostly driven by amyloid and tau imaging, suggesting their 
continuous changes along the full spectrum of AD progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects 
older adults. Currently, AD is associated with certain hypometabolic biomarkers, 
beta-amyloid peptides, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and changes in brain 
morphology. Accurate diagnosis of AD, as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
(prodromal stage of AD), is essential for early care of the disease. As a 
result, machine learning techniques have been used in recent years for the 
diagnosis of AD. In this research, we propose a novel methodology to generate a 
multivariate model that combines different types of features for the detection 
of AD. In order to obtain a robust biomarker, ADNI baseline data, clinical and 
neuropsychological assessments (1024 features) of 106 patients were used. The 
data were normalized, and a genetic algorithm was implemented for the selection 
of the most significant features. Subsequently, for the development and 
validation of the multivariate classification model, a support vector machine 
model was created, and a five-fold cross-validation with an AUC of 87.63% was 
used to measure model performance. Lastly, an independent blind test of our 
final model, using 20 patients not considered during the model construction, 
yielded an AUC of 100%.

Amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease 
specifically affect discrete neuronal systems, but the underlying mechanisms 
that render some brain regions more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology 
than others remain largely unknown. Here we studied molecular properties 
underlying these distinct regional vulnerabilities by analysing Alzheimer's 
disease-typical neuroimaging patterns of amyloid deposition and 
neurodegeneration in relation to regional gene expression profiles of the human 
brain. Graded patterns of brain-wide vulnerability to amyloid deposition and 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease were estimated by contrasting 
multimodal amyloid-sensitive PET and structural MRI data between patients with 
Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 126) enrolled in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Regional gene expression 
profiles were derived from brain-wide microarray measurements provided by the 
Allen brain atlas of the adult human brain transcriptome. In a hypothesis-driven 
analysis focusing on the genes coding for the amyloid precursor (APP) and tau 
proteins (MAPT), regional expression levels of APP were positively correlated 
with the severity of regional amyloid deposition (r = 0.44, P = 0.009), but not 
neurodegeneration (r = 0.01, P = 0.96), whereas the opposite pattern was 
observed for MAPT (neurodegeneration: r = 0.46, P = 0.006; amyloid: r = 0.08, P 
= 0.65). Using explorative gene set enrichment analysis, amyloid-vulnerable 
regions were found to be characterized by relatively low expression levels of 
gene sets implicated in protein synthesis and mitochondrial respiration. By 
contrast, neurodegeneration-vulnerable regions were characterized by relatively 
high expression levels of gene sets broadly implicated in neural plasticity, 
with biological functions ranging from neurite outgrowth and synaptic contact 
over intracellular signalling cascades to proteoglycan metabolism. At the 
individual gene level this data-driven analysis further corroborated the 
association between neurodegeneration and MAPT expression, and additionally 
identified associations with known tau kinases (CDK5, MAPK1/ERK2) alongside 
components of their intracellular (Ras-ERK) activation pathways. Sensitivity 
analyses showed that these pathology-specific imaging-genetic associations were 
largely robust against changes in some of the methodological parameters, 
including variation in the brain donor sample used for estimating regional gene 
expression profiles, and local variations in the Alzheimer's disease-typical 
imaging patterns when these were derived from an independent patient cohort 
(BioFINDER study). These findings highlight that the regionally selective 
vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology relates to specific 
molecular-functional properties of the affected neural systems, and that the 
implicated biochemical pathways largely differ for amyloid accumulation versus 
neurodegeneration. The data provide novel insights into the complex 
pathophysiological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and point to 
pathology-specific treatment targets that warrant further exploration in 
independent studies.

BACKGROUND: Individuals on the preclinical Alzheimer's continuum, particularly 
those with both amyloid and tau positivity (A + T +), display a rapid cognitive 
decline and elevated disease progression risk. However, limited studies exist on 
brain atrophy trajectories within this continuum over extended periods.
METHODS: This study involved 367 ADNI participants grouped based on combinations 
of amyloid and tau statuses determined through cerebrospinal fluid tests. Using 
longitudinal MRI scans, brain atrophy was determined according to the whole 
brain, lateral ventricle, and hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness in 
AD-signature regions. Cognitive performance was evaluated with the Preclinical 
Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). A generalized linear mixed-effects model 
was used to examine group × time interactions for these measures. In addition, 
progression risks to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia were compared 
among the groups using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: A total of 367 participants (48 A + T + , 86 A + T - , 63 A - T + , and 
170 A - T - ; mean age 73.8 years, mean follow-up 5.1 years, and 47.4% men) were 
included. For the lateral ventricle and PACC score, the A + T - and 
A + T + groups demonstrated statistically significantly greater volume expansion 
and cognitive decline over time than the A - T - group (lateral ventricle: 
β = 0.757 cm3/year [95% confidence interval 0.463 to 1.050], P < .001 for 
A + T - , and β = 0.889 cm3/year [0.523 to 1.255], P < .001 for A + T + ; PACC: 
β =  - 0.19 /year [- 0.36 to - 0.02], P = .029 for A + T - , and β =  - 0.59 
/year [- 0.80 to - 0.37], P < .001 for A + T +). Notably, the A + T + group 
exhibited additional brain atrophy including the whole brain (β =  - 2.782 
cm3/year [- 4.060 to - 1.504], P < .001), hippocampus (β =  - 0.057 cm3/year 
[- 0.085 to - 0.029], P < .001), and AD-signature regions (β =  - 0.02 mm/year 
[- 0.03 to - 0.01], P < .001). Cox proportional hazards models suggested an 
increased risk of progressing to MCI or dementia in the A + T + group versus the 
A - T - group (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.35 [1.76 to 6.39]).
CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal individuals, A + T + compounds brain atrophy 
and cognitive deterioration, amplifying the likelihood of disease progression. 
Therapeutic interventions targeting A + T + individuals could be pivotal in 
curbing brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and disease progression.

See Coulthard and Knight (doi:10.1093/aww335) for a scientific commentary on 
this article.Individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease 
clinical diagnoses can display significant phenotypic heterogeneity. This 
variability likely reflects underlying genetic, environmental and 
neuropathological differences. Characterizing this heterogeneity is important 
for precision diagnostics, personalized predictions, and recruitment of 
relatively homogeneous sets of patients into clinical trials. In this study, we 
apply state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods to the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging cohort (ADNI) to elucidate the heterogeneity of 
neuroanatomical differences between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 
530) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 314) and cognitively normal individuals (n = 
399), thereby adding to an increasing literature aiming to establish 
neuroanatomical and neuropathological (e.g. amyloid and tau deposition) 
dimensions in Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stages. These dimensional 
approaches aim to provide surrogate measures of heterogeneous underlying 
pathologic processes leading to cognitive impairment. We relate these 
neuroimaging patterns to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, white matter 
hyperintensities, cognitive and clinical measures, and longitudinal 
trajectories. We identified four such atrophy patterns: (i) individuals with 
largely normal neuroanatomical profiles, who also turned out to have the least 
abnormal cognitive and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles and the slowest 
clinical progression during follow-up; (ii) individuals with classical 
Alzheimer's disease neuroanatomical, cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers 
and clinical profile, who presented the fastest clinical progression; (iii) 
individuals with a diffuse pattern of atrophy with relatively less pronounced 
involvement of the medial temporal lobe, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid 
amyloid-β1-42 values, and proportionally greater executive impairment; and (iv) 
individuals with notably focal involvement of the medial temporal lobe and a 
slow steady progression, likely representing in early Alzheimer's disease 
stages. These four atrophy patterns effectively define a 4-dimensional 
categorization of neuroanatomical alterations in mild cognitive impairment and 
Alzheimer's disease that can complement existing dimensional approaches for 
staging Alzheimer's disease using a variety of biomarkers, which offer the 
potential for enabling precision diagnostics and prognostics, as well as 
targeted patient recruitment of relatively homogeneous subgroups of subjects for 
clinical trials.

Aging has been recognized as a major driving force of the Alzheimer's disease's 
(AD) progression, however, the relationship between brain aging and AD is still 
unclear. There is also a lack of studies investigating the influence of AD risk 
factors on brain aging in cognitively normal people. Here, the "Brain Age Gap 
Estimation" (BrainAGE) framework was applied to investigate the effects of AD 
risk factors on individual brain aging. Across a total of 165 cognitively normal 
elderly subjects, although no significant difference was observed in the 
BrainAGE scores among the three groups, AD risk dose (i.e., the number of AD 
risk factors) is tend to associated with an increased BrainAGE scores 
(high-risk > middle risk > low risk). Female exhibited more advanced brain aging 
(P = 0.004), and higher education years were associated with preserved brain 
aging (P < 0.001). APOE-ɛ4 (P = 0.846) and family history (FH) of dementia 
(P = 0.209) did not increase BrainAGE scores. When comparing 52 aMCI patients 
with 38 cognitively normal controls from ADNI dataset, aMCI patients showed 
significantly increased BrainAGE scores. BrainAGE scores were negatively 
correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels in the aMCI group (r = -0.275, P = 0.048). With 
an accuracy of 68.9%, BrainAGE outperformed APOE-ɛ4 and hippocampus gray matter 
volume (GMV) in predicting aMCI. In conclusion, AD is independently associated 
with structural changes in the brain that reflect advanced aging. Potentially, 
BrainAGE combined with APOE-ɛ4 and hippocampus GMV could be used as a 
pre-screening tool in early-stage AD.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that neuroinflammation 
contributes actively to pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and promotes 
AD progression. The predictive value of neuroinflammatory biomarkers for 
disease-staging or estimating disease progression is not well understood. In 
this study, we investigate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of inflammatory 
biomarkers in combination with conventional AD biomarkers.
METHODS: We included 258 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) who had CSF biomarkers of β-Amyloid (Aβ), tau, and 
inflammation. The primary outcome of interest was clinically meaningful 
cognitive decline (CMCD) as defined by an increase of ≥4 on the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscore 11 (ADAS-11, scores 0-70, higher 
scores indicate worse cognition). Predictor variables were categorized as 
demographics (D; age, sex, and education), genetic (APOE4 status (A)), 
inflammatory biomarkers (I), and classic (C) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarkers of Aβ and p-tau181. Simultaneous inclusion of eleven CSF inflammatory 
biomarkers as covariates in logistic regression models was examined to assess 
improvements in classifying baseline clinical diagnoses (cognitively normal 
(CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Dementia) and predicting individuals with 
and without CMCD over one year of follow-up.
RESULTS: At 1-year follow up, 27.1% of participants experienced CMCD. Inclusion 
of inflammatory biomarkers improved baseline classification of CN vs MCI as well 
as CN vs Dementia for models including D and A variables (DA; both p<0.001). 
Similarly, when classic CSF biomarkers of AD were included into the model (DAC 
model), inclusion of inflammatory markers improved classification of CN vs MCI 
(p<0.01) as well as CN vs Dementia (p<0.001). Addition of inflammatory 
biomarkers to both DA and DAC models improved predictive performance for CMCD in 
persons with baseline MCI and Dementia (all p<0.05), but not in the CN group. In 
addition, the predictive performance of the DAI model was superior to the DAC 
model in the MCI and Dementia groups (both p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of CSF inflammatory biomarkers to CSF biomarkers of AD can 
improve diagnostic accuracy of clinical disease stage at baseline and add 
incremental value to AD biomarkers for prediction of cognitive decline.

Whether the deleterious effects of APOE4 are restricted to the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) spectrum or cause cognitive impairment irrespectively of the 
development of AD is still a matter of debate, and the focus of this study. Our 
analyses included APOE4 genotype, neuropsychological variables, amyloid-βeta 
(Aβ) and Tau markers, FDG-PET values, and hippocampal volumetry data derived 
from the healthy controls sample of the ADNI database. We formed 4 groups of 
equal size (n = 30) based on APOE4 carriage and amyloid-PET status. Baseline and 
follow-up (i.e., 48 months post-baseline) results indicated that Aβ-positivity 
was the most important factor to explain poorer cognitive performance, while 
APOE4 only exerted a significant effect in Aβ-positive subjects. Additionally, 
multiple regression analyses evidenced that, within the Aβ-positive sample, 
hippocampal volumetry explained most of the variability in cognitive performance 
for APOE4 carriers. These findings represent a strong support for the so-called 
preclinical/prodromal hypothesis, which states that the reported differences in 
cognitive performance between healthy carriers and non-carriers are mainly due 
to the APOE4's capability to increase the risk of AD. Moreover, our results 
reinforce the notion that a synergistic interaction of Aβ and APOE4 elicits a 
neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus that might be the main cause of 
impaired cognitive performance.

PURPOSE: To compare the accuracies of predicting AD conversion by using a 
decision support system (PredictAD tool) and current research criteria of 
prodromal AD as identified by combinations of episodic memory impairment of 
hippocampal type and visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on 
MRI and CSF biomarkers.
METHODS: Altogether 391 MCI cases (158 AD converters) were selected from the 
ADNI cohort. All the cases had baseline cognitive tests, MRI and/or CSF levels 
of Aβ1-42 and Tau. Using baseline data, the status of MCI patients (AD or MCI) 
three years later was predicted using current diagnostic research guidelines and 
the PredictAD software tool designed for supporting clinical diagnostics. The 
data used were 1) clinical criteria for episodic memory loss of the hippocampal 
type, 2) visual MTA, 3) positive CSF markers, 4) their combinations, and 5) when 
the PredictAD tool was applied, automatically computed MRI measures were used 
instead of the visual MTA results. The accuracies of diagnosis were evaluated 
with the diagnosis made 3 years later.
RESULTS: The PredictAD tool achieved the overall accuracy of 72% (sensitivity 
73%, specificity 71%) in predicting the AD diagnosis. The corresponding number 
for a clinician's prediction with the assistance of the PredictAD tool was 71% 
(sensitivity 75%, specificity 68%). Diagnosis with the PredictAD tool was 
significantly better than diagnosis by biomarkers alone or the combinations of 
clinical diagnosis of hippocampal pattern for the memory loss and biomarkers 
(p≤0.037).
CONCLUSION: With the assistance of PredictAD tool, the clinician can predict AD 
conversion more accurately than the current diagnostic criteria.

The positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-flortaucipir can distinguish 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
from cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. This study aimed to evaluate the 
utility of 18F-flortaucipir-PET images and multimodal data integration in the 
differentiation of CU from MCI or AD through DL. We used cross-sectional data 
(18F-flortaucipir-PET images, demographic and neuropsychological score) from the 
ADNI. All data for subjects (138 CU, 75 MCI, 63 AD) were acquired at baseline. 
The 2D convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) and 3D 
CNN were conducted. Multimodal learning was conducted by adding the clinical 
data with imaging data. Transfer learning was performed for classification 
between CU and MCI. The AUC for AD classification from CU was 0.964 and 0.947 in 
2D CNN-LSTM and multimodal learning. The AUC of 3D CNN showed 0.947, and 0.976 
in multimodal learning. The AUC for MCI classification from CU had 0.840 and 
0.923 in 2D CNN-LSTM and multimodal learning. The AUC of 3D CNN showed 0.845, 
and 0.850 in multimodal learning. The 18F-flortaucipir PET is effective for the 
classification of AD stage. Furthermore, the effect of combination images with 
clinical data increased the performance of AD classification.

The physiological basis of resilience to age-associated and AD-typical 
neurodegenerative pathology is still not well understood. So far, the 
established resilience factor intelligence has been shown to be associated with 
white matter network global efficiency, a key constituent of which are highly 
connected hubs. However, hub properties have also been shown to be impaired in 
AD. Individual predisposition or vulnerability of hub properties may thus 
modulate the impact of pathology on cognitive outcome and form part of the 
physiological basis of resilience. 85 cognitively normal elderly subjects and 
patients with MCI with DWI, MRI and AV45-PET scans were included from ADNI. We 
reconstructed the global WM networks in each subject and characterized 
hub-properties of GM regions using graph theory by calculating regional 
betweenness centrality. Subsequently, we investigated whether regional GM volume 
(GMV) and structural WM connectivity (WMC) of more hub-like regions was more 
associated with resilience, quantified as cognitive performance independent of 
amyloid burden, tau and WM lesions. Subjects with higher resilience showed 
higher increased regional GMV and WMC in more hub-like compared to less hub-like 
GM-regions. Additionally, this association was in some instances further 
increased at elevated amounts of brain pathology. Higher GMV and WMC of more 
hub-like regions may contribute more to resilience compared to less hub-like 
regions, reflecting their increased importance to brain network efficiency, and 
may thus form part of the neurophysiological basis of resilience. Future studies 
should investigate the factors leading to higher GMV and WMC of hubs in 
non-demented elderly with higher resilience.

We set out to determine factors that influence the rate of brain atrophy in 
1-year longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. With tensor-based 
morphometry (TBM), we mapped the 3-dimensional profile of progressive atrophy in 
144 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) (age: 76.5 +/- 7.4 years), 
338 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 76.0 +/- 7.2), and 202 healthy 
controls (77.0 +/- 5.1), scanned twice, 1 year apart. Statistical maps revealed 
significant age and sex differences in atrophic rates. Brain atrophic rates were 
about 1%-1.5% faster in women than men. Atrophy was faster in younger than older 
subjects, most prominently in mild cognitive impairment, with a 1% increase in 
the rates of atrophy and 2% in ventricular expansion, for every 10-year decrease 
in age. TBM-derived atrophic rates correlated with reduced beta-amyloid and 
elevated tau levels (n = 363) at baseline, baseline and progressive 
deterioration in clinical measures, and increasing numbers of risk alleles for 
the ApoE4 gene. TBM is a sensitive, high-throughput biomarker for tracking 
disease progression in large imaging studies; sub-analyses focusing on women or 
younger subjects gave improved sample size requirements for clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central 
nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and 
may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have 
long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, 
quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to 
improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This 
work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from 
T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based 
disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease 
Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for 
early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent 
large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank.
FINDINGS: 1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control 
images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 
participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI 
cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification 
performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD 
detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted 
structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus 
and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The 
normalized ML model's probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was 
evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There 
are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during 
pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the 
integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 
0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score 
is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% 
CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows 
association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our 
integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score 
quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we 
validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging 
scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. 
In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical 
assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological 
markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated 
with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we 
can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in 
the future.
INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated 
using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease 
probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early 
detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression. To 
facilitate community engagement and external tests of model utility, an 
interactive app to explore summary level data from this study and dive into 
external data can be found here https://ndds-brainimaging-ml.streamlit.app. As 
far as we know, this is the first publicly available cloud-based MRI prediction 
application.

BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) changes may be related to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) alterations, but it is unclear how the apolipoprotein E ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4) allele 
affects their association.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of BMI changes with AD pathologies in APOE 
ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers.
METHODS: In 862 non-demented ADNI participants with≥2 BMI measurements, we 
investigated the relationships between BMI slopes and longitudinal changes in 
amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, neurodegeneration and cognition, and follow-up tau 
deposition in different Aβ and APOE ɛ4 statuses.
RESULTS: In Aβ+ APOE ɛ4 non-carriers, faster BMI declines were associated with 
faster rates of Aβ accumulation (standardized β (βstd) = -0.29, p = 0.001), AD 
meta regions of interest (metaROI) hypometabolism (βstd = 0.23, p = 0.026), 
memory declines (βstd = 0.17, p = 0.029), executive function declines 
(βstd = 0.19, p = 0.011), and marginally faster Temporal-metaROI cortical 
thinning (βstd = 0.15, p = 0.067) and higher follow-up Temporal-metaROI tau 
deposition (βstd = -0.17, p = 0.059). Among Aβ- individuals, faster BMI 
decreases were related to faster Aβ accumulation (βstd = -0.25, p = 0.023) in 
APOE ɛ4 carriers, whereas predicted faster declines in memory and executive 
function in both APOE ɛ4 carriers (βstd = 0.25, p = 0.008; βstd = 0.32, 
p = 0.001) and APOE ɛ4 non-carriers (βstd = 0.11, p = 0.030; βstd = 0.12, 
p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significance of tracking BMI data in 
older adults by providing novel insights into how body weight fluctuations and 
APOE ɛ4 interact with AD pathology and cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Crucial to the success of clinical trials targeting early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is recruiting participants who are more likely to 
progress over the course of the trials. We hypothesize that a combination of 
plasma and structural MRI biomarkers, which are less costly and non-invasive, is 
predictive of longitudinal progression measured by atrophy and cognitive decline 
in early AD, providing a practical alternative to PET or cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Longitudinal T1-weighted MRI, cognitive (memory-related test scores and 
clinical dementia rating scale), and plasma measurements of 245 cognitively 
normal (CN) and 361 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients from ADNI were 
included. Subjects were further divided into β-amyloid positive/negative 
(Aβ+/Aβ-)] subgroups. Baseline plasma (p-tau181 and neurofilament light chain) 
and MRI-based structural medial temporal lobe subregional measurements and their 
association with longitudinal measures of atrophy and cognitive decline were 
tested using stepwise linear mixed effect modeling in CN and MCI, as well as 
separately in the Aβ+/Aβ- subgroups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analyses were performed to investigate the discriminative power of each model in 
separating fast and slow progressors (first and last terciles) of each 
longitudinal measurement.
RESULTS: A total of 245 CN (35.0% Aβ+) and 361 MCI (53.2% Aβ+) participants were 
included. In the CN and MCI groups, both baseline plasma and structural MRI 
biomarkers were included in most models. These relationships were maintained 
when limited to the Aβ+ and Aβ- subgroups, including Aβ- CN (normal aging). ROC 
analyses demonstrated reliable discriminative power in identifying fast from 
slow progressors in MCI [area under the curve (AUC): 0.78-0.93] and more 
modestly in CN (0.65-0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: The present data support the notion that plasma and MRI biomarkers, 
which are relatively easy to obtain, provide a prediction for the rate of future 
cognitive and neurodegenerative progression that may be particularly useful in 
clinical trial stratification and prognosis. Additionally, the effect in Aβ- CN 
indicates the potential use of these biomarkers in predicting a normal 
age-related decline.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
β-amyloid (Aβ) associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. The 
functional form to model the association between Aβ and regional brain atrophy 
has not been well defined. To determine the relationship between Aβ and atrophy, 
we compared the performance of the usual dichotomization of cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ to identify subjects as Aβ+ and Aβ- with a trilinear spline model of 
CSF Aβ.
METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
and 108 cognitively normal controls with baseline CSF Aβ and up to 4 years of 
longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed using mixed-effects regression. 
Piecewise-linear splines were used to evaluate the nonlinear nature of the 
association between CSF Aβ and regional atrophy and to identify points of 
acceleration of atrophy with respect to Aβ. Several parameterizations of CSF Aβ 
were compared using likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion. 
Periods of acceleration of atrophy in which subjects transition from CSF Aβ 
negativity to CSF Aβ positivity were estimated from the spline models and tested 
for significance.
RESULTS: Spline models resulted in better fits for many temporal and parietal 
regions compared with the dichotomous models. The trilinear model showed that 
periods of acceleration of atrophy varied greatly by region with early changes 
seen in the insula, amygdala, precuneus, hippocampus, and other temporal 
regions, occurring before the clinical threshold for CSF Aβ positivity.
DISCUSSION: The use of piecewise-linear splines provides an improved model of 
the nonlinear association between CSF Aβ and regional atrophy in regions 
implicated in the progression of AD. The important biological finding of this 
work is that some brain regions show periods of accelerated volume loss well 
before the CSF Aβ42 threshold. This implies that signs of brain atrophy develop 
before the current conventional definition of "preclinical AD".

IMPORTANCE: The emergence of psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) is 
associated with accelerated cognitive and functional decline that may be related 
to disease pathology.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the longitudinal dynamics of plasma tau phosphorylated 
at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels 
in association with the emergence of psychotic symptoms (delusions and 
hallucinations) in the context of AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used longitudinal data from 
the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Baseline analyses compared 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (both with psychosis [AD+P] 
and without psychosis [AD-P]) and participants who were cognitively unimpaired 
(CU). For the longitudinal analysis, participants with MCI and AD were 
subdivided into patients with evidence of psychosis at baseline (AD+P baseline) 
and patients free of psychosis at baseline who showed incidence of psychosis 
over the course of the study (AD+P incident). Study data were analyzed between 
June and November 2023.
EXPOSURES: Plasma p-tau181 and NfL measures in individuals with MCI and AD, both 
with and without psychosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma p-tau181 and NfL quantifications up to 48 
months and concurrent assessments of presence or absence of delusions and 
hallucinations via the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questionnaire.
RESULTS: The cohort included 752 participants with AD (mean [SD] age, 74.2 [7.7] 
years; 434 male [57.7%]). A total of 424 CU participants had a mean (SD) age of 
75.4 (6.6) years of whom 222 were female (52.4%). In the longitudinal analysis 
of p-tau181 trajectories of the AD+P group, the group of patients who showed 
incidence of psychosis over the course of follow-up (AD+P incident) demonstrated 
an associated increase in plasma p-tau181 levels compared with the group of 
patients who had psychosis at baseline (AD+P baseline) and showed an associated 
decrease in plasma p-tau181 levels (F4, 117 = 3.24; P = .01). The mean slope of 
p-tau181 change was significantly different in AD+P incident and AD+P baseline 
groups (F5,746 = 86.76, P < .0001) and when only individuals with amyloid-β 
positivity (Aβ+), which was determined using positron emission tomography, were 
compared (F5,455 = 84.60, P < .001). Patients who experienced psychosis at any 
time had increased levels of NfL relative to those who never experienced 
psychosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that the 
emergence of psychosis in AD was associated with elevations in plasma levels of 
p-tau181, highlighting the potential utility of plasma p-tau181 as a biomarker 
of neuropsychiatric illness in AD, which could have implications for predictive 
and treatment response strategies.

Cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β is thought to be the starting mechanism in 
Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β can be detected by analysis of cerebrospinal 
fluid amyloid-β42 or amyloid positron emission tomography, but it is unknown if 
any of the methods can identify an abnormal amyloid accumulation prior to the 
other. Our aim was to determine whether cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42 change 
before amyloid PET during preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. We included 
437 non-demented subjects from the prospective, longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. All underwent (18)F-florbetapir positron 
emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42 analysis at baseline and 
at least one additional positron emission tomography after a mean follow-up of 
2.1 years (range 1.1-4.4 years). Group classifications were based on normal and 
abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography results at 
baseline. We found that cases with isolated abnormal cerebrospinal fluid 
amyloid-β and normal positron emission tomography at baseline accumulated 
amyloid with a mean rate of 1.2%/year, which was similar to the rate in cases 
with both abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography 
(1.2%/year, P = 0.86). The mean accumulation rate of those with isolated 
abnormal cerebrospinal fluid was more than three times that of those with both 
normal cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography (0.35%/year, P = 
0.018). The group differences were similar when analysing yearly change in 
standardized uptake value ratio of florbetapir instead of percentage change. 
Those with both abnormal cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography 
deteriorated more in memory and hippocampal volume compared with the other 
groups (P < 0.001), indicating that they were closer to Alzheimer's disease 
dementia. The results were replicated after adjustments of different factors and 
when using different cut-offs for amyloid-β abnormality including a positron 
emission tomography classification based on the florbetapir uptake in regions 
where the initial amyloid-β accumulation occurs in Alzheimer's disease. This is 
the first study to show that individuals who have abnormal cerebrospinal 
amyloid-β42 but normal amyloid-β positron emission tomography have an increased 
cortical amyloid-β accumulation rate similar to those with both abnormal 
cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography and higher rate than 
subjects where both modalities are normal. The results indicate that 
cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42 becomes abnormal in the earliest stages of 
Alzheimer's disease, before amyloid positron emission tomography and before 
neurodegeneration starts.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown altered immune responses in the periphery. We 
studied P2X7 (a proinflammatory receptor and a scavenger receptor) and two 
integrins, CD11b and CD11c, on the surface of circulating leukocytes and 
analysed their associations with Aβ-PET, brain atrophy, neuropsychological 
assessments, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Total 287 age-matched, 
sex-balanced participants were recruited in a discovery cohort and two 
validation cohorts through the AIBL study and studied using tri-colour flow 
cytometry. Our results demonstrated reduced expressions of P2X7, CD11b, and 
CD11c on leukocytes, particularly monocytes, in Aβ +ve cases compared with Aβ 
-ve controls. P2X7 and integrin downregulation was observed at pre-clinical 
stage of AD and stayed low throughout disease course. We further constructed a 
polygenic risk score (PRS) model based on 12 P2RX7 risk alleles to assess the 
genetic impact on P2X7 function in AIBL and ADNI cohorts. No significant 
association was identified between the P2RX7 gene and AD, indicating that P2X7 
downregulation in AD is likely caused by environmental changes rather than 
genetic factors. In conclusion, the downregulation of P2X7 and integrins at 
pre-clinical stage of AD indicates altered pro-inflammatory responses, 
phagocytic functions, and migrating capabilities of circulating monocytes in 
early AD pathogenesis. Our study not only improves our understanding of 
peripheral immune involvement in early stage of AD but also provides more 
insights into novel biomarker development, diagnosis, and prognosis of AD.

Previous studies of Aβ plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline 
Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) plasma measurement (50% with 4 serial annual 
measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their 
concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and 
Aβ(1-42) measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between Aβ and 
diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions 
were associated with altered concentrations of plasma Aβ. The effect of age 
differed according to AD stage. Plasma Aβ(1-42) showed mild correlation with 
other biomarkers of Aβ pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. 
Longitudinal measurements of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) plasma levels showed modest 
value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of 
complementary measures of Aβ pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma Aβ) and other 
biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is 
significant because it shows that plasma Aβ measurements have limited value for 
disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year 
follow-up. However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma Aβ measurements 
could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at 
increased risk for AD. Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding 
of the biology and dynamics of plasma Aβ as well as the need for longer term 
studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Aβ.

BACKGROUND: There are no agreed-upon variables for predicting progression from 
unimpaired cognition to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or from aMCI 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: Use ADNI data to develop a 'Framingham-like' prediction model for a 
4-year period.
METHODS: We developed models using the strongest baseline predictors from six 
domains (demographics, neuroimaging, CSF biomarkers, genetics, cognitive tests, 
and functional ability). We chose the best predictor from each domain, which was 
dichotomized into more versus less harmful.
RESULTS: There were 224 unimpaired individuals and 424 aMCI subjects with 
baseline data on all predictors, of whom 37 (17% ) and 150 (35% ) converted to 
aMCI and AD, respectively, during 4 years of follow-up. For the unimpaired, CSF 
tau/Aβ ratio, hippocampal volume, and a memory score predicted progression. For 
those aMCI at baseline, the same predictors plus APOE4 status and functional 
ability predicted progression. Demographics and family history were not 
important predictors for progression for either group. The fit statistic was 
good for the unimpaired-aMCI model (C-statistic 0.80) and very good for the 
aMCI-AD model (C-statistic 0.91). Among the unimpaired, those with no harmful 
risk factors had a 4-year predicted 2% risk of progression, while those with the 
most harmful risk factors had a predicted 35% risk. The aMCI subjects with no 
harmful risk factors had a predicted 1% risk of progression those with all six 
harmful risk factors had a predicted 90% risk.
CONCLUSION: Our parsimonious model accurately predicted progression from 
unimpaired to aMCI with three variables, and from aMCI to AD with five 
variables.

Apolipoprotein B (APOB), a receptor-binding protein present in cholesterol-rich 
lipoproteins, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). High levels of 
APOB-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are linked to the pathogenesis of 
both early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic AD. Rare coding mutations in 
the APOB gene are associated with familial AD, suggesting a role for APOB-bound 
lipoproteins in the central nervous system. This research explores APOB gene 
regulation across the AD spectrum using four cohorts: BRAINEAC (elderly control 
brains), DBCBB (controls, AD brains), ROSMAP (controls, MCI, AD brains), and 
ADNI (control, MCI, AD clinical subjects). APOB protein levels, measured via 
mass spectrometry and ELISA, positively correlated with AD pathology indices and 
cognition, while APOB mRNA levels showed negative correlations. Brain APOB 
protein levels are also correlated with cortical Aβ levels. A common coding 
variant in the APOB gene locus affected its expression but didn't impact AD risk 
or brain cholesterol concentrations, except for 24-S-hydroxycholesterol. 
Polymorphisms in the CYP27A1 gene, notably rs4674344, were associated with APOB 
protein levels. A negative correlation was observed between brain APOB gene 
expression and AD biomarker levels. CSF APOB correlated with Tau pathology in 
presymptomatic subjects, while cortical APOB was strongly associated with 
cortical Aβ deposition in late-stage AD. The study discusses the potential link 
between blood-brain barrier dysfunction and AD symptoms in relation to APOB 
neurobiology. Overall, APOB's involvement in lipoprotein metabolism appears to 
influence AD pathology across different stages of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Over 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with 
increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We categorized these loci into 
immunity, lipid metabolism, and endocytosis pathways, and associated the 
polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated, with AD biomarkers in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) subjects.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify associations between 
pathway-specific PRS and AD biomarkers in patients with MCI and healthy 
controls.
METHODS: AD biomarkers ([18F]Florbetapir-PET SUVR, FDG-PET SUVR, hippocampal 
volume, CSF tau and amyloid-β levels) and neurocognitive tests scores were 
obtained in 258 healthy controls and 451 MCI subjects from the ADNI dataset at 
baseline and at 24-month follow up. Pathway-related (immunity, lipid metabolism, 
and endocytosis) and total polygenic risk scores were calculated from 20 SNPs. 
Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test predictive value of the 
polygenic risk scores over longitudinal biomarker and cognitive changes.
RESULTS: Higher immune risk score was associated with worse cognitive measures 
and reduced glucose metabolism. Higher lipid risk score was associated with 
increased amyloid deposition and cortical hypometabolism. Total, immune, and 
lipid scores were associated with significant changes in cognitive measures, 
amyloid deposition, and brain metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Polygenic risk scores highlights the influence of specific genes on 
amyloid-dependent and independent pathways; and these pathways could be 
differentially influenced by lipid and immune scores respectively.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Updates in Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnostic 
guidelines by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 
and the International Working Group (IWG) over the past 11 years may affect 
clinical diagnoses. We assessed how these guidelines affect clinical AD 
diagnosis in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired 
(CI) individuals.
METHODS: We applied clinical and biomarker data in algorithms to classify 
individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort 
according to the following diagnostic guidelines for AD: 2011 NIA-AA, 2016 
IWG-2, 2018 NIA-AA, and 2021 IWG-3, assigning the following generic diagnostic 
labels: (1) not AD (nAD), (2) increased risk of developing AD (irAD), and (3) 
AD. Diagnostic labels were compared according to their frequency, convergence 
across guidelines, biomarker profiles, and prognostic value. We also evaluated 
the diagnostic discordance among the criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 1,195 individuals (mean age 73.2 ± 7.2 years, mean education 
16.1 ± 2.7, 44.0% female) presented different repartitions of diagnostic labels 
according to the 2011 NIA-AA (nAD = 37.8%, irAD = 23.0%, AD = 39.2%), 2016 IWG-2 
(nAD = 37.7%, irAD = 28.7%, AD = 33.6%), 2018 NIA-AA (nAD = 40.7%, irAD = 9.3%, 
AD = 50.0%), and 2021 IWG-3 (nAD = 51.2%, irAD = 8.4%, AD = 48.3%) frameworks. 
Discordant diagnoses across all guidelines were found in 512 participants 
(42.8%) (138 [91.4%] occurring in only β-amyloid [CU 65.4%, CI 34.6%] and 191 
[78.6%] in only tau-positive [CU 71.7%, CI 28.3%] individuals). Differences in 
predicting cognitive impairment between nAD and irAD groups were observed with 
the 2011 NIA-AA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, 95% CI 1.34-3.65, p = 0.002), 2016 
IWG-2 (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.59-4.96, p < 0.000), and 2021 IWG-3 (HR 3.61, 95% CI 
2.09-6.23, p < 0.000), but not with 2018 NIA-AA (HR 1.69, 95% CI 0.87-3.28, p = 
0.115).
DISCUSSION: Over 42% of the studied population presented discordant diagnoses 
when using the different examined AD criteria, mostly in individuals with a 
single positive biomarker. Except for 2018 NIA-AA, all guidelines identified 
asymptomatic individuals at risk of cognitive impairment. Our findings highlight 
important differences between the guidelines, emphasizing the necessity for 
updated criteria with enhanced staging metrics, considering clinical, research, 
therapeutic, and trial design aspects.

BACKGROUND: Self and informant (proxy or study partner) reports of everyday 
cognitive functioning have been shown to be associated with incipient 
neurodegenerative disease. The 20-item Cognitive Change Index (CCI) and the 
39-item Measurement of Everyday Cognition (ECog) were each developed to 
characterize early subjective changes in cognitive function.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between CCI and ECog self and 
informant-based evaluations to determine content overlap and provide a 
co-calibration for converting between these widely used instruments.
METHODS: 950 participants (57.1% female, mean age = 71.2 years) from ADNI and 
the Indiana ADRC with self-based evaluations and 279 participants (60.9% female, 
mean age = 71.8 years) with informant-based evaluations (Indiana ADRC) were 
included. Analyzed variables for the CCI and ECog included domain mean scores, 
memory domain total scores, and total scores for all items. Spearman 
correlations, regression analyses, and frequency distributions were used to 
assess the relationship between CCI and ECog. Sex, age, years of education, 
race/ethnicity, APOE ɛ4 carrier status, and baseline diagnosis were also 
analyzed as potentially relevant covariates.
RESULTS: CCI and ECog total scores were highly correlated for the self 
(r = 0.795, p < 0.001) and informant-based (r = 0.840, p < 0.001) versions, as 
expected. Frequency distributions of self and informant total scores were 
generated and plotted separately. Quadratic regressions for self (r2 = 0.626) 
and informant (r2 = 0.741) scores were used to create a translation table 
between the CCI and ECog total scores.
CONCLUSION: Self and informant total scores can be harmonized and translated 
between the CCI and ECog to facilitate cross-study and longitudinal assessment 
of perceived cognitive change, an important patient-reported outcome.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease consensus recommends biomarker 
dichotomization, a practice with well-described clinical strengths and 
methodological limitations. Although neuroimaging studies have explored 
alternative biomarker interpretation strategies, a formally defined three-range 
approach and its prognostic impact remains under-explored for cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers .
METHODS: With two-graph receiver-operating characteristics based on different 
reference schemes, we derived three-range cut-points for CSF Elecsys biomarkers. 
According to baseline CSF status, we assessed the prognostic utility of this in 
predicting risk of clinical progression and longitudinal trajectories of 
cognitive decline and amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) 
accumulation in non-demented individuals (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative [ADNI]; n = 1246). In all analyses, we compared herein-derived 
three-range CSF cut-points to previously described binary ones.
RESULTS: In our main longitudinal analyses, we highlight CSF p-tau181/Aβ1-42 
three-range cut-points derived based on the cognitively normal Aβ-PET negative 
versus dementia Aβ-PET positive reference scheme for best depicting a 
prognostically relevant biomarker abnormality range. Longitudinally, our 
approach revealed a divergent intermediate cognitive trajectory undetected by 
dichotomization and a clearly abnormal group at higher risk for cognitive 
decline, with power analyses suggesting the latter group as potential trial 
enrichment candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with 
intermediate-range CSF status have similar rates of Aβ deposition to those in 
the clearly abnormal group.
DISCUSSION: The proposed approach can refine clinico-biological prognostic 
assessment and potentially enhance trial recruitment, as it captures faster 
biomarker-related cognitive decline in comparison to binary cut-points. Although 
this approach has implications for trial recruitment and observational studies, 
further discussion is needed regarding clinical practice applications.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) are risk factors for early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may 
accelerate the progression rate of AD pathology. As amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques 
are a hallmark of AD pathology, we hypothesized that TBI and PTSD might increase 
Aβ accumulation in the brain.
METHODS: We examined PET and neuropsychological data from Vietnam War veterans 
compiled by the US Department of Defense Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative, to examine the spatial distribution of Aβ in male veterans' who had 
experienced a TBI and/or developed PTSD. Subjects were classified into controls, 
TBI only, PTSD only, and TBI with PTSD (TBI_PTSD) groups and data were analyzed 
using both voxel-based and ROI-based approaches.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, all three clinical groups showed a pattern of 
mainly increased referenced standard uptake values (SUVR) for the amyloid tracer 
[18F]-AV45 PET, with rank order PTSD > TBI_PTSD > TBI > Control, and same rank 
order was seen in the deficits of cognitive functions. SUVR increase was 
observed in widespread cortical regions of the PTSD group; in white matter of 
the TBI_PTSD group; and cerebellum and precuneus area of the TBI group, in 
contrast with controls. The [18F]-AV45 SUVR correlated negatively with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid levels and positively with the CSF tau 
concentrations.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both TBI and PTSD are substantial risk 
factors for cognition decline and increased Aβ deposition resembling that in AD. 
In addition, both PTSD and TBI_PTSD have a different pathways of Aβ 
accumulation.

This study evaluates the individual, as well as relative and joint value of 
indices obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of brain atrophy 
(quantified by the SPARE-AD index), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, APOE 
genotype, and cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog) in progression from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a variable 
follow-up period up to 6 years, using data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1). SPARE-AD was first established as a highly 
sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects 
(AUC = 0.98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then 
compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were 
found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly 
better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly 
improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE ε4 
provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). 
In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of 
Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive 
value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in 
amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of 
clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in 
combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, 
which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that 
SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression 
is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the 
core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial. Further, due to 
the prevalence of co-pathologies, the precise role of WMH in cognition and 
neurodegeneration also remains uncertain.
METHODS: Herein, we analyzed 1803 participants with available WMH volume data, 
extracted from the ADNI database, including 756 cognitively normal controls, 783 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 264 patients with dementia. 
Participants were grouped according to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathology (A/T 
profile) severity. Linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the 
factors associated with WMH volume. Modeled by linear mixed-effects, the 
increase rates (Δ) of the WMH volume, cognition, and typical neurodegenerative 
markers were assessed. The predictive effectiveness of WMH volume was 
subsequently tested using Cox regression analysis, and the relationship between 
WMH/ΔWMH and other indicators such as cognition was explored through linear 
regression analyses. Furthermore, we explored the interrelationship among 
amyloid-β deposition, cognition, and WMH using mediation analysis.
RESULTS: Higher WMH volume was associated with older age, lower CSF amyloid-β 
levels, hypertension, and smoking history (all p ≤ 0.001), as well as cognitive 
status (MCI, p < 0.001; dementia, p = 0.008), but not with CSF tau levels. These 
results were further verified in any clinical stage, except hypertension and 
smoking history in the dementia stage. Although WMH could not predict dementia 
conversion, its increased levels at baseline were associated with a worse 
cognitive performance and a more rapid memory decline. Longitudinal analyses 
showed that baseline dementia and positive amyloid-β status were associated with 
a greater accrual of WMH volume, and a higher ΔWMH was also correlated with a 
faster cognitive decline. In contrast, except entorhinal cortex thickness, the 
WMH volume was not found to be associated with any other neurodegenerative 
markers. To a lesser extent, WMH mediates the relationship between amyloid-β and 
cognition.
CONCLUSION: WMH are non-specific lesions that are associated with amyloid-β 
deposition, cognitive status, and a variety of vascular risk factors. Despite 
evidence indicating only a weak relationship with neurodegeneration, early 
intervention to reduce WMH lesions remains a high priority for preserving 
cognitive function in the elderly.

BACKGROUND: There are contradictory findings regarding the effect of statin 
drugs on amyloid β (Aβ) deposition as one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), along with tau pathology. We aimed to longitudinally investigate 
the therapeutic and preventive role of statin drugs by examining the brain Aβ 
deposition and metabolism rate in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: The data of 828 subjects including 178 HC, 492 MCI, and 158 AD 
individuals were obtained from ADNI. The baseline and longitudinal [18 F] AV45 
and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) measures 
were investigated among statin users and non-users.
RESULTS: Our results showed that there is no significant difference in baseline 
Aβ deposition and metabolism rate between statin users and non-users among HC, 
MCI, and AD subjects. While there was no significant effect of statin on 
metabolism rate, there was a significant difference in Aβ deposition change 
after 4 years (from baseline) between statin users and non-users within HC 
subjects (p = 0.011). The change of Aβ deposition at 4 years from baseline was 
-2.0 ± 6.3% for statin users and 1.4 ± 4.7% for non-users. There was no 
significant association between statin duration use with baseline and 
longitudinal Aβ deposition and metabolism rate. However, statin dosage was 
significantly associated with Aβ deposition in 2 years (r = -0.412, p = 0.021) 
in the HC group. Moreover, our analysis showed a significant correlation between 
total statin exposure (duration×dosage) and Aβ deposition in 2 years visit 
(r = -0.198, p = 0.037) in HC subjects. Furthermore, we investigated the 
longitudinal changes within each group of statin users and non-users separately 
in linear mixed models. Our findings showed that there are no significant 
changes in AV45 and FDG SUVR among both groups.
CONCLUSION: The present longitudinal analysis revealed that using statins might 
be beneficial in slowing down or stabilizing the Aβ deposition due to aging in 
subjects without cognitive impairment. However, once the clinical symptoms of 
cognitive impairment appear, statins fail to slow down Aβ deposition. Overall, 
our findings revealed that statin users might have slower Aβ aggregation than 
non-users.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related devastating neurodegenerative 
disorder, which severely impacts on the global economic development and 
healthcare system. Though AD has been studied for more than 100 years since 
1906, the exact cause(s) and pathogenic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. 
Also, the efficient disease-modifying treatment and ideal diagnostic method for 
AD are unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, an invariant 
pathophysiological feature of AD, may be a critical contributor to the 
pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we firstly discussed the features 
of cerebral glucose metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. 
Then, we further reviewed the contribution of glucose transportation abnormality 
and intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction in AD pathophysiology, and 
proposed a hypothesis that multiple pathogenic cascades induced by impaired 
cerebral glucose metabolism could result in neuronal degeneration and 
consequently cognitive deficits in AD patients. Among these pathogenic 
processes, altered functional status of thiamine metabolism and brain insulin 
resistance are highly emphasized and characterized as major pathogenic 
mechanisms. Finally, considering the fact that AD patients exhibit cerebral 
glucose hypometabolism possibly due to impairments of insulin signaling and 
altered thiamine metabolism, we also discuss some potential possibilities to 
uncover diagnostic biomarkers for AD from abnormal glucose metabolism and to 
develop drugs targeting at repairing insulin signaling impairment and correcting 
thiamine metabolism abnormality. We conclude that glucose metabolism abnormality 
plays a critical role in AD pathophysiological alterations through the induction 
of multiple pathogenic factors such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and so forth. To clarify the causes, pathogeneses and consequences 
of cerebral hypometabolism in AD will help break the bottleneck of current AD 
study in finding ideal diagnostic biomarker and disease-modifying therapy.

BACKGROUND: The metabolic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is poorly understood, 
and the relationships between systemic abnormalities in metabolism and AD 
pathogenesis are unclear. Understanding how global perturbations in metabolism 
are related to severity of AD neuropathology and the eventual expression of AD 
symptoms in at-risk individuals is critical to developing effective 
disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we undertook parallel metabolomics 
analyses in both the brain and blood to identify systemic correlates of 
neuropathology and their associations with prodromal and preclinical measures of 
AD progression.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Quantitative and targeted metabolomics (Biocrates 
AbsoluteIDQ [identification and quantification] p180) assays were performed on 
brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study 
of Aging (BLSA) (N = 44, mean age = 81.33, % female = 36.36) from AD (N = 15), 
control (CN; N = 14), and "asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease" (ASYMAD, i.e., 
individuals with significant AD pathology but no cognitive impairment during 
life; N = 15) participants. Using machine-learning methods, we identified a 
panel of 26 metabolites from two main classes-sphingolipids and 
glycerophospholipids-that discriminated AD and CN samples with accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity of 83.33%, 86.67%, and 80%, respectively. We then 
assayed these 26 metabolites in serum samples from two well-characterized 
longitudinal cohorts representing prodromal (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative [ADNI], N = 767, mean age = 75.19, % female = 42.63) and preclinical 
(BLSA) (N = 207, mean age = 78.68, % female = 42.63) AD, in which we tested 
their associations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-related 
brain atrophy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, risk of 
conversion to incident AD, and trajectories of cognitive performance. We 
developed an integrated blood and brain endophenotype score that summarized the 
relative importance of each metabolite to severity of AD pathology and disease 
progression (Endophenotype Association Score in Early Alzheimer's Disease 
[EASE-AD]). Finally, we mapped the main metabolite classes emerging from our 
analyses to key biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. We found that 
distinct sphingolipid species including sphingomyelin (SM) with acyl residue 
sums C16:0, C18:1, and C16:1 (SM C16:0, SM C18:1, SM C16:1) and 
hydroxysphingomyelin with acyl residue sum C14:1 (SM (OH) C14:1) were 
consistently associated with severity of AD pathology at autopsy and AD 
progression across prodromal and preclinical stages. Higher log-transformed 
blood concentrations of all four sphingolipids in cognitively normal individuals 
were significantly associated with increased risk of future conversion to 
incident AD: SM C16:0 (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.430, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
1.703-11.520, p = 0.002), SM C16:1 (HR = 3.455, 95% CI = 1.516-7.873, p = 
0.003), SM (OH) C14:1 (HR = 3.539, 95% CI = 1.373-9.122, p = 0.009), and SM 
C18:1 (HR = 2.255, 95% CI = 1.047-4.855, p = 0.038). The sphingolipid species 
identified map to several biologically relevant pathways implicated in AD, 
including tau phosphorylation, amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism, calcium homeostasis, 
acetylcholine biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Our study has limitations: the 
relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited our power to 
detect significant associations, control for heterogeneity between groups, and 
replicate our findings in independent, autopsy-derived brain samples.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel framework to identify biologically relevant 
brain and blood metabolites associated with disease pathology and progression 
during the prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. Our results show that 
perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism are consistently associated with 
endophenotypes across preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as with AD pathology 
at autopsy. Sphingolipids may be biologically relevant biomarkers for the early 
detection of AD, and correcting perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism may be 
a plausible and novel therapeutic strategy in AD.
