BACKGROUNDSoluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) 
plays an important role in the clearance of pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore sTREM2 as a central and 
peripheral predictor of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to 
AD.METHODSsTREM2 and Aβ1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
florbetapir-PET (AV45) images were analyzed for healthy control (HCs), patients 
with MCI, and patients with AD from the ADNI database. Peripheral plasma sTREM2 
and Aβ1-42 levels were determined for our Neurology database of Ruijin Hospital 
for Alzheimer's Disease (NRHAD) cohort, and patients with MCI were reevaluated 
at follow-up visits to assess for progression to AD. The association between CSF 
and plasma sTREM2 levels was analyzed in data from the Chinese Alzheimer's 
Biomarker and Lifestyle (CABLE) database.RESULTSThe results showed that patients 
with MCI who had low levels of CSF sTREM2 and Aβ1-42 were more likely to develop 
AD. Among participants with positive Aβ deposition, as assessed by AV45 imaging, 
elevated CSF sTREM2 levels were associated with a decreased risk of MCI-to-AD 
conversion. Meanwhile, in the NRHAD cohort, individuals in the MCI group with 
high sTREM2 levels in plasma were at a greater risk for AD, whereas low Aβ1-42 
with high sTREM2 levels in plasma were associated with a faster cognitive 
decline. In addition, CSF sTREM2 levels were highly correlated with plasma 
sTREM2 levels in the CABLE database.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest that sTREM2 
may be useful as a potential predictive biomarker of MCI-to-AD 
conversion.FUNDINGThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related devastating neurodegenerative 
disorder, which severely impacts on the global economic development and 
healthcare system. Though AD has been studied for more than 100 years since 
1906, the exact cause(s) and pathogenic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. 
Also, the efficient disease-modifying treatment and ideal diagnostic method for 
AD are unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, an invariant 
pathophysiological feature of AD, may be a critical contributor to the 
pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we firstly discussed the features 
of cerebral glucose metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. 
Then, we further reviewed the contribution of glucose transportation abnormality 
and intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction in AD pathophysiology, and 
proposed a hypothesis that multiple pathogenic cascades induced by impaired 
cerebral glucose metabolism could result in neuronal degeneration and 
consequently cognitive deficits in AD patients. Among these pathogenic 
processes, altered functional status of thiamine metabolism and brain insulin 
resistance are highly emphasized and characterized as major pathogenic 
mechanisms. Finally, considering the fact that AD patients exhibit cerebral 
glucose hypometabolism possibly due to impairments of insulin signaling and 
altered thiamine metabolism, we also discuss some potential possibilities to 
uncover diagnostic biomarkers for AD from abnormal glucose metabolism and to 
develop drugs targeting at repairing insulin signaling impairment and correcting 
thiamine metabolism abnormality. We conclude that glucose metabolism abnormality 
plays a critical role in AD pathophysiological alterations through the induction 
of multiple pathogenic factors such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and so forth. To clarify the causes, pathogeneses and consequences 
of cerebral hypometabolism in AD will help break the bottleneck of current AD 
study in finding ideal diagnostic biomarker and disease-modifying therapy.

As our understanding of the neurobiology of Alzheimer Disease deepens, it has 
become evident that early intervention is critical to achieving successful 
therapeutic impact. The availability of diagnostic criteria for preclinical 
Alzheimer Disease adds momentum to research directed at this goal and even to 
prevention. The landscape of therapeutic research is thus poised to undergo a 
dramatic shift in the next 5-10 years, with clinical trials involving subjects 
at risk for Alzheimer Disease who have few or no symptoms. These trials will 
also likely rely heavily on genetics, biomarkers, and or risk factor 
stratification to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer Disease. Here, we 
propose a conceptual framework to guide this next generation of pharmacological 
and non-pharmacological clinical pursuit, and discuss some of the foreseeable 
ethical considerations that may accompany them.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes have been described according to genetics, 
neuropsychology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging. Thirty-one patients with 
clinically probable AD were selected based on perisylvian metabolic decrease on 
FDG-PET. They were compared to 25 patients with a typical pattern of decreased 
posterior metabolism. Tree-based machine learning was used on those 56 images to 
create a classifier that was subsequently applied to 207 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) patients with AD. Machine learning was also used 
to discriminate between the two ADNI groups based on neuropsychological scores. 
Compared to AD patients with a typical precuneus metabolic decrease, the new 
subtype showed stronger hypometabolism in the temporoparietal junction. The 
classifier was able to distinguish the two groups in the ADNI population. Both 
groups could only be distinguished cognitively by Trail Making Test-A scores. 
This study further confirms that there is more than a typical metabolic pattern 
in probable AD with amnestic presentation.

IMPORTANCE: Knowledge is lacking on the prevalence and prognosis of individuals 
with a β-amyloid-negative, tau-positive (A-T+) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarker profile.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of a CSF A-T+ biomarker profile and 
investigate its clinical implications.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of the 
cross-sectional multicenter University of Gothenburg (UGOT) cohort (November 
2019-January 2021), the longitudinal multicenter Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort (individuals with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 
no cognitive impairment; September 2005-May 2022), and 2 Wisconsin cohorts, 
Wisconsin Alzheimer Disease Research Center and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer 
Prevention (WISC; individuals without cognitive impairment; February 
2007-November 2020). This was a multicenter study, with data collected from 
referral centers in clinical routine (UGOT) and research settings (ADNI and 
WISC). Eligible individuals had 1 lumbar puncture (all cohorts), 2 or more 
cognitive assessments (ADNI and WISC), and imaging (ADNI only) performed on 2 
separate occasions. Data were analyzed on August 2022 to April 2023.
EXPOSURES: Baseline CSF Aβ42/40 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181; cognitive 
tests (ADNI: modified preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite [mPACC]; WISC: 
modified 3-test PACC [PACC-3]). Exposures in the ADNI cohort included 
[18F]-florbetapir amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), and cross-sectional 
tau-PET (ADNI: [18F]-flortaucipir, WISC: [18F]-MK6240).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CSF AT 
biomarker profiles and continuous longitudinal global cognitive outcome and 
imaging biomarker trajectories in A-T+ vs A-T- groups. Secondary outcomes 
included cross-sectional tau-PET.
RESULTS: A total of 7679 individuals (mean [SD] age, 71.0 [8.4] years; 4101 male 
[53%]) were included in the UGOT cohort, 970 individuals (mean [SD] age, 73 
[7.0] years; 526 male [54%]) were included in the ADNI cohort, and 519 
individuals (mean [SD] age, 60 [7.3] years; 346 female [67%]) were included in 
the WISC cohort. The prevalence of an A-T+ profile in the UGOT cohort was 4.1% 
(95% CI, 3.7%-4.6%), being less common than the other patterns. Longitudinally, 
no significant differences in rates of worsening were observed between A-T+ and 
A-T- profiles for cognition or imaging biomarkers. Cross-sectionally, A-T+ had 
similar tau-PET uptake to individuals with an A-T- biomarker profile.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest that the CSF A-T+ biomarker profile 
was found in approximately 5% of lumbar punctures and was not associated with a 
higher rate of cognitive decline or biomarker signs of disease progression 
compared with biomarker-negative individuals.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) PET Core has evolved over 
time, beginning with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of a subsample 
of participants with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, adding tracers for 
measurement of β-amyloid, followed by tau tracers. This review examines the 
evolution of the ADNI PET Core, the novel aspects of PET imaging in each stage 
of ADNI, and gives an accounting of PET images available in the ADNI database. 
The ADNI PET Core has been and continues to be a rich resource that provides 
quantitative PET data and preprocessed PET images to the scientific community, 
allowing interrogation of both basic and clinically relevant questions. By 
standardizing methods across different PET scanners and multiple PET tracers, 
the Core has demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale, multi-center PET 
studies. Data managed and disseminated by the PET Core has been critical to 
defining pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and helped to 
drive methods used in modern therapeutic trials. HIGHLIGHTS: The ADNI PET Core 
began with FDG-PET and now includes three amyloid and three tau PET ligands. The 
PET Core has standardized acquisition and analysis of multitracer PET images. 
The ADNI PET Core helped to develop methods that have facilitated clinical 
trials in AD.

Florbetapir 18 F (AV45), a highly sensitive and specific positron emission 
tomographic (PET) molecular biomarker binding to the amyloid-β of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), is constrained by radiation and cost. We sought to combat it by 
combining multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and a collaborative 
generative adversarial networks model (CollaGAN) to develop a multimodal 
MRI-derived Amyloid-β (MRAβ) biomarker. We collected multimodal MRI and PET AV45 
data of 380 qualified participants from the ADNI dataset and 64 subjects from 
OASIS3 dataset. A five-fold cross-validation CollaGAN were applied to generate 
MRAβ. In the ADNI dataset, we found MRAβ could characterize the subject-level 
AV45 spatial variations in both AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Voxel-wise two-sample t-tests demonstrated amyloid-β depositions identified by 
MRAβ in AD and MCI were significantly higher than healthy controls (HCs) in 
widespread cortices (p < .05, corrected) and were much similar to those by AV45 
(r > .92, p < .001). Moreover, a 3D ResNet classifier demonstrated that MRAβ was 
comparable to AV45 in discriminating AD from HC in both the ADNI and OASIS3 
datasets, and in discriminate MCI from HC in ADNI. Finally, we found MRAβ could 
mimic cortical hyper-AV45 in HCs who later converted to MCI (r = .79, p < .001) 
and was comparable to AV45 in discriminating them from stable HC (p > .05). In 
summary, our work illustrates that MRAβ synthesized by multimodal MRI could 
mimic the cerebral amyloid-β depositions like AV45 and lends credence to the 
feasibility of advancing MRI toward molecular-explainable biomarkers.

PURPOSE: Brain aging is a complex and heterogeneous process characterized by 
both structural and functional decline. This study aimed to establish a novel 
deep learning (DL) method for predicting brain age by utilizing structural and 
metabolic imaging data.
METHODS: The dataset comprised participants from both the Universal Medical 
Imaging Diagnostic Center (UMIDC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). The former recruited 395 normal control (NC) subjects, while 
the latter included 438 NC subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
subjects, and 56 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. We developed a novel 
dual-pathway, 3D simple fully convolutional network (Dual-SFCNeXt) to estimate 
brain age using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG 
PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images of NC subjects as 
input. Several prevailing DL models were trained and tested using either MRI or 
PET data for comparison. Model accuracies were evaluated using mean absolute 
error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Brain age gap (BAG), 
deviations of brain age from chronologic age, was correlated with cognitive 
assessments in MCI and AD subjects.
RESULTS: Both PET- and MRI-based models achieved high prediction accuracy. The 
leading model was the SFCNeXt (the single-pathway version) for PET (MAE = 2.92, 
r = 0.96) and MRI (MAE = 3.23, r = 0.95) on all samples. By integrating both PET 
and MRI images, the Dual-SFCNeXt demonstrated significantly improved accuracy 
(MAE = 2.37, r = 0.97) compared to all single-modality models. Significantly 
higher BAG was observed in both the AD (P < 0.0001) and MCI (P < 0.0001) groups 
compared to the NC group. BAG correlated significantly with Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores (r=-0.390 for AD, r=-0.436 for MCI) and the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores (r = 0.333 for AD, r = 0.372 
for MCI).
CONCLUSION: The integration of [18F]FDG PET with structural MRI enhances the 
accuracy of brain age prediction, potentially introducing a new avenue for 
related multimodal brain age prediction studies.

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has been considered to be a driving force of 
Alzheimer's disease. However, the association between peripheral immunity and AD 
has been rarely investigated.
METHODS: Separate regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations 
among peripheral immune markers and cognition, neuroimaging, and AD pathology. 
Causal mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the associations with 
cognition were mediated by AD pathology.
RESULTS: A total of 1107 participants (43.9% female, mean age of 73.2 years) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included. 
Regression analyses indicated that elevated neutrophils (NEU) count and 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were associated with lower levels of global 
cognition, memory function (MEM), and executive function (EF), and reduced brain 
metabolism by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as 
well as greater ventricular volume. An elevated NLR was associated with a lower 
level of β-amyloid (Aβ) and a higher level of total tau (T-tau) in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), smaller hippocampal volume (HV), and lesser entorhinal cortex (EC) 
thickness. On the contrary, an elevated level of lymphocytes (LYM) was 
associated with a higher level of Aβ and a lower level of T-tau in CSF, better 
cognition, and less atrophy of brain regions (ventricular volume, HV, and EC 
thickness). The associations of LYM and NLR with cognition were mediated by Aβ 
and T-tau pathology (proportion: 18%~64%; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that two types of peripheral immune cells (NEU and LYM) 
and the ratio of these two cell types (NLR) had associations with cognition, 
neuroimaging, and AD pathology. The associations might be mediated by Aβ and tau 
pathology.

BACKGROUND: Hypometabolism detected by fluorodeoxyglucose F18 positron emission 
tomography ([18F] FDG PET) is an early neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and provides important pathologic staging information.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to discover genetic interactions that regulate 
longitudinal glucose metabolic decline in AD-related brain regions.
METHODS: A total of 586 non-Hispanic white individuals from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1/GO/2 cohorts that met all quality 
control criteria were included in this study. Genome-wide association study of 
glucose metabolic decline in regions of interest (ROIs) was performed with 
linear regression under the additive genetic model.
RESULTS: We identified two novel variants that had a strong association with 
longitudinal metabolic decline in different ROI. Rs4819351-A in gene 
1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) demonstrated reduced 
metabolic decline in right temporal gyrus (p = 3.97×10-8, β= -0.016), while 
rs13387360-T in gene LOC101928196 demonstrated reduced metabolic decline in left 
angular gyrus (p = 1.69×10-8, β= -0.027).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest two genome-wide significant SNPs (rs4819351, 
rs13387360) in AGPAT3 and LOC101928196 as protective loci that modulate glucose 
metabolic decline. These two genes should be further investigated as potential 
therapeutic target for neurodegeneration diseases.

INTRODUCTION: The Centiloid scale was developed to harmonise the quantification 
of β-amyloid (Aβ) PET images across tracers, scanners, and processing pipelines. 
However, several groups have reported differences across tracers and scanners 
even after centiloid conversion. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of 
different pre and post-processing harmonisation steps on the robustness of 
longitudinal Centiloid data across three large international cohort studies.
METHODS: All Aβ PET data in AIBL (N = 3315), ADNI (N = 3442) and OASIS3 
(N = 1398) were quantified using the MRI-based Centiloid standard SPM pipeline 
and the PET-only pipeline CapAIBL. SUVR were converted into Centiloids using 
each tracer's respective transform. Global Aβ burden from pre-defined target 
cortical regions in Centiloid units were quantified for both raw PET scans and 
PET scans smoothed to a uniform 8 mm full width half maximum (FWHM) effective 
smoothness. For Florbetapir, we assessed the performance of using both the 
standard Whole Cerebellum (WCb) and a composite white matter (WM)+WCb reference 
region. Additionally, our recently proposed quantification based on Non-negative 
Matrix Factorisation (NMF) was applied to all spatially and SUVR normalised 
images. Correlation with clinical severity measured by the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and effect size, as well as tracer agreement in 
11C-PiB-18F-Florbetapir pairs and longitudinal consistency were evaluated.
RESULTS: The smoothing to a uniform resolution partially reduced longitudinal 
variability, but did not improve inter-tracer agreement, effect size or 
correlation with MMSE. Using a Composite reference region for 18F-Florbetapir 
improved inter-tracer agreement, effect size, correlation with MMSE, and 
longitudinal consistency. The best results were however obtained when using the 
NMF method which outperformed all other quantification approaches in all metrics 
used.
CONCLUSIONS: FWHM smoothing has limited impact on longitudinal consistency or 
outliers. A Composite reference region including subcortical WM should be used 
for computing both cross-sectional and longitudinal Florbetapir Centiloid. NMF 
improves Centiloid quantification on all metrics examined.

BACKGROUND: Some individuals, called Supernormals (SN), maintain excellent 
memory in old age. While brain structural and functional integrity in SN seem to 
be aging-resistant, their amyloidosis and neural injury status has not been well 
studied.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare cortical amyloid deposition and 
glucose metabolism between SN and older adults with normal cognition (NC), 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Subjects from the ADNI database were included if they received 
T1-weighted MRI, amyloid PET, FDG-PET, and cognitive testing within a 6-month 
period, yielding 27 AD, 69 MCI, 172 NC, and 122 SN. PET standardized uptake 
value ratios (SUVrs) were calculated for the whole cortex and 68 regions of 
interest, with whole cerebellum serving as reference.
RESULTS: SN had lower whole cortex amyloid than MCI, and higher glucose 
metabolism than all others. Regional analysis revealed that amyloid burden and 
glucose metabolism in the right isthmus cingulate cortex differed in SN compared 
to others, while SN glucose metabolism also differed from others in several 
frontal and temporal regions.
CONCLUSION: Preserved cortical glucose metabolism, and lower levels of 
amyloidosis and glucose hypometabolism in the right isthmus cingulate cortex, 
contributes to the Supernormal phenomenon. These findings may be informative for 
development of early screening biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
modification of cognitive trajectories.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a state between normal cognition 
and dementia. However, MCI diagnosis does not necessarily guarantee the 
progression to dementia. Since no previous study investigated brain positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging of MCI-- to-normal reversion, we provided PET 
imaging of MCI- to-normal reversion using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database.
METHODS: We applied comprehensive neuropsychological criteria (NP criteria), 
consisting of memory, language, and attention/executive function domains, to 
include patients with a baseline diagnosis of MCI (n=613). According to the 
criteria, the year 1 status of the patients was categorized into three groups 
(reversion: n=105, stable MCI: n=422, conversion: n=86). Demographic, 
neuropsychological, genetic, CSF, and cognition biomarker variables were 
compared between the groups. Additionally, after adjustment for confounding 
variables, the deposition pattern of amyloid-β and cerebral glucose metabolism 
were compared between three groups via AV45- and FDG-PET modalities, 
respectively.
RESULTS: MCI reversion rate was 17.1% during one year of follow-up. The 
reversion group had the lowest frequency of APOE ε4+ subjects, the highest CSF 
level of amyloid-β, and the lowest CSF levels of t-tau and p-tau. 
Neuropsychological assessments were also suggestive of better cognitive 
performance in the reversion group. Patients with reversion to normal state had 
higher glucose metabolism in bilateral angular and left middle/inferior temporal 
gyri, when compared to those with stable MCI state. Meanwhile, lower amyloid-β 
deposition at baseline was observed in the frontal and parietal regions of the 
reverted subjects. On the other hand, the conversion group showed lower cerebral 
glucose metabolism in bilateral angular and bilateral middle/inferior temporal 
gyri compared to the stable MCI group, whereas the amyloid-β accumulation was 
similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: This longitudinal study provides novel insight regarding the 
application of PET imaging in predicting MCI transition over time.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between 
normal aging and dementia. Studies on MCI progression are important for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention. 18F fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) has been proven to be a powerful tool for measuring 
cerebral glucose metabolism. In this study, we proposed a classification 
framework for MCI prediction with both baseline and multiple follow-up FDG-PET 
scans as well as cognitive scores of 33 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients and 46 
stable MCI (sMCI) patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI).
METHOD: First, PET images were normalized using the Yakushev normalization 
procedure and registered to the Brainnetome Atlas (BNA). The average metabolic 
intensities of brain regions were defined as static features. Dynamic features 
were the intensity variation between baseline and the other three time points 
and change ratios with the intensity obtained at baseline considered as 
reference. Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and Alzheimer's disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-cog) scores of each time point were 
collected as cognitive features. And F-score was applied for feature selection. 
Finally, support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel 
was used for the three above features.
RESULTS: Dynamic features showed the best classification performance in accuracy 
of 88.61% than static features (accuracy of 78.48%). And the combination of 
cognitive features and dynamic features improved the classification performance 
in specificity of 95.65% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.9308.
CONCLUSION: Our results reported that dynamic features are more representative 
in longitudinal research for MCI prediction work. And dynamic features and 
cognitive scores complementarily enhance the classification performance in 
specificity and AUC. These findings may predict the disease course and clinical 
changes in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variations in the inflammatory Caspase-1 gene have been 
shown associated with cognitive function in elderly individuals and in 
predisposition to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its detailed mechanism before 
the typical AD onset was still unclear. Our current study evaluated the impact 
of Caspase-1 common variant rs554344 on the pathological processes of brain 
amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Data used in our study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We examined the relationship between 
Caspase-1 rs554344 allele carrier status with AD-related cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), PET, and MRI measures at baseline by using a multiple linear regression 
model. We also analyzed the longitudinal effects of this variant on the change 
rates of CSF biomarkers and imaging data using a mixed effect model.
RESULTS: We found that Caspase-1 variant was significantly associated with FDG 
PET levels and CSF t-tau levels at baseline in total non-demented elderly group, 
and especially in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroup. In addition, this 
variant was also detected associated with CSF p-tau levels in MCI subgroup. The 
mediation analysis showed that CSF p-tau partially mediated the association 
between Caspase-1 variant and CSF t-tau levels, accounting for 80% of the total 
effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated a potential role of Caspase-1 variant in 
influencing cognitive function might through changing tau 
related-neurodegeneration process.

The reference standard for amyloid-PET quantification requires structural MRI 
(sMRI) for preprocessing in both multi-site research studies and clinical 
trials. Here we describe rPOP (robust PET-Only Processing), a MATLAB-based 
MRI-free pipeline implementing non-linear warping and differential smoothing of 
amyloid-PET scans performed with any of the FDA-approved radiotracers 
(18F-florbetapir/FBP, 18F-florbetaben/FBB or 18F-flutemetamol/FLUTE). Each image 
undergoes spatial normalization based on weighted PET templates and data-driven 
differential smoothing, then allowing users to perform their quantification of 
choice. Prior to normalization, users can choose whether to automatically reset 
the origin of the image to the center of mass or proceed with the pipeline with 
the image as it is. We validate rPOP with n = 740 (514 FBP, 182 FBB, 44 FLUTE) 
amyloid-PET scans from the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning - 
Brain Health Registry sub-study (IDEAS-BHR) and n = 1,518 scans from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 1,249 FBP, n = 269 FBB), 
including heterogeneous acquisition and reconstruction protocols. After running 
rPOP, a standard quantification to extract Standardized Uptake Value ratios and 
the respective Centiloids conversion was performed. rPOP-based amyloid status 
(using an independent pathology-based threshold of ≥24.4 Centiloid units) was 
compared with either local visual reads (IDEAS-BHR, n = 663 with complete valid 
data and reads available) or with amyloid status derived from an MRI-based PET 
processing pipeline (ADNI, thresholds of >20/>18 Centiloids for FBP/FBB). 
Finally, within the ADNI dataset, we tested the linear associations between 
rPOP- and MRI-based Centiloid values. rPOP achieved accurate warping for 
N = 2,233/2,258 (98.9%) in the first pass. Of the N = 25 warping failures, 24 
were rescued with manual reorientation and origin reset prior to warping. We 
observed high concordance between rPOP-based amyloid status and both visual 
reads (IDEAS-BHR, Cohen's k = 0.72 [0.7-0.74], ∼86% concordance) or MRI-pipeline 
based amyloid status (ADNI, k = 0.88 [0.87-0.89], ∼94% concordance). rPOP- and 
MRI-pipeline based Centiloids were strongly linearly related (R2:0.95, p<0.001), 
with this association being significantly modulated by estimated PET resolution 
(β= -0.016, p<0.001). rPOP provides reliable MRI-free amyloid-PET warping and 
quantification, leveraging widely available software and only requiring an 
attenuation-corrected amyloid-PET image as input. The rPOP pipeline enables the 
comparison and merging of heterogeneous datasets and is publicly available at

INTRODUCTION: This article reviews the work done in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative positron emission tomography (ADNI PET) core over the 
past 5 years, largely concerning techniques, methods, and results related to 
amyloid imaging in ADNI.
METHODS: The PET Core has used [(18)F]florbetapir routinely on ADNI 
participants, with over 1600 scans available for download. Four different 
laboratories are involved in data analysis, and have examined factors such as 
longitudinal florbetapir analysis, use of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in 
clinical trials, and relationships between different biomarkers and cognition.
RESULTS: Converging evidence from the PET Core has indicated that 
cross-sectional and longitudinal florbetapir analyses require different 
reference regions. Studies have also examined the relationship between 
florbetapir data obtained immediately after injection, which reflects perfusion, 
and FDG-PET results. Finally, standardization has included the translation of 
florbetapir PET data to a centiloid scale.
CONCLUSION: The PET Core has demonstrated a variety of methods for the 
standardization of biomarkers such as florbetapir PET in a multicenter setting.

BACKGROUND: ¹⁸F-FDFG uptake by brain tissue as measured by positron emission 
tomography (PET) is a well-established method for assessment of brain function 
in people with dementia. Certain findings on brain PET scans can potentially 
predict the decline of mild cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease 
dementia or other dementias.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ¹⁸F-FDG PET index test 
for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to 
Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy 
Studies, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, BIOSIS previews, 
LILACS, MEDION, (Meta-analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek), DARE (Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Health Technology Assessment Database), 
ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility) and C-EBLM (International 
Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Committee for 
Evidence-based Laboratory Medicine) databases to January 2013. We checked the 
reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews for additional 
studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy 
of ¹⁸F-FDG PET to determine the conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease 
dementia or to other forms of dementia, i.e. any or all of vascular dementia, 
dementia with Lewy bodies, and fronto-temporal dementia. These studies 
necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia and are 
sometimes labelled as 'delayed verification cross-sectional studies'.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two blinded review authors independently extracted 
data, resolving disagreement by discussion, with the option to involve a third 
review author as arbiter if necessary. We extracted and summarised graphically 
the data for two-by-two tables. We conducted exploratory analyses by plotting 
estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. When studies had mixed 
thresholds, we derived estimates of sensitivity and likelihood ratios at fixed 
values (lower quartile, median and upper quartile) of specificity from the 
hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) models.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies (421 participants) in the analysis. The 
sensitivities for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia were 
between 25% and 100% while the specificities were between 15% and 100%. From the 
summary ROC curve we fitted we estimated that the sensitivity was 76% (95% 
confidence interval (CI): 53.8 to 89.7) at the included study median specificity 
of 82%. This equates to a positive likelihood ratio of 4.03 (95% CI: 2.97 to 
5.47), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.75). Three 
studies recruited participants from the same Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort but only the largest ADNI study (Herholz 2011) is 
included in the meta-analysis. In order to demonstrate whether the choice of 
ADNI study or discriminating brain region (Chételat 2003) or reader assessment 
(Pardo 2010) make a difference to the pooled estimate, we performed five 
additional analyses. At the median specificity of 82%, the estimated sensitivity 
was between 74% and 76%. There was no impact on our findings. In addition to 
evaluating Alzheimer's disease dementia, five studies evaluated the accuracy of 
¹⁸F-FDG PET for all types of dementia. The sensitivities were between 46% and 
95% while the specificities were between 29% and 100%; however, we did not 
conduct a meta-analysis because of too few studies, and those studies which we 
had found recruited small numbers of participants. Our findings are based on 
studies with poor reporting, and the majority of included studies had an unclear 
risk of bias, mainly for the reference standard and participant selection 
domains. According to the assessment of Index test domain, more than 50% of 
studies were of poor methodological quality.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to determine to what extent the findings 
from the meta-analysis can be applied to clinical practice. Given the 
considerable variability of specificity values and lack of defined thresholds 
for determination of test positivity in the included studies, the current 
evidence does not support the routine use of ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans in clinical 
practice in people with MCI. The ¹⁸F-FDG PET scan is a high-cost investigation, 
and it is therefore important to clearly demonstrate its accuracy and to 
standardise the process of ¹⁸F-FDG PET diagnostic modality prior to its being 
widely used. Future studies with more uniform approaches to thresholds, analysis 
and study conduct may provide a more homogeneous estimate than the one available 
from the included studies we have identified.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has described distinct subtypes of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) based on the differences in regional patterns of brain atrophy on 
MRI. We conducted a data-driven exploration of distinct AD neurodegeneration 
subtypes using FDG-PET as a sensitive molecular imaging marker of 
neurodegenerative processes.
METHODS: Hierarchical clustering of voxel-wise FDG-PET data from 177 
amyloid-positive patients with AD dementia enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to identify distinct hypometabolic 
subtypes of AD, which were then further characterized with respect to clinical 
and biomarker characteristics. We then classified FDG-PET scans of 217 
amyloid-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment ("prodromal AD") 
according to the identified subtypes and studied their domain-specific cognitive 
trajectories and progression to dementia over a follow-up interval of up to 
72 months.
RESULTS: Three main hypometabolic subtypes were identified: (i) "typical" 
(48.6%), showing a classic posterior temporo-parietal hypometabolic pattern; 
(ii) "limbic-predominant" (44.6%), characterized by old age and a 
memory-predominant cognitive profile; and (iii) a relatively rare 
"cortical-predominant" subtype (6.8%) characterized by younger age and more 
severe executive dysfunction. Subtypes classified in the prodromal AD sample 
demonstrated similar subtype characteristics as in the AD dementia sample and 
further showed differential courses of cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings complement recent research efforts on MRI-based 
identification of distinct AD atrophy subtypes and may provide a potentially 
more sensitive molecular imaging tool for early detection and characterization 
of AD-related neurodegeneration variants at prodromal disease stages.

OBJECTIVES: Mild cognitive impairment presenting with an amnestic syndrome 
(aMCI) and amyloid positivity is considered due to AD. Many subjects, however, 
can show an overall very slow progression relevant for differential diagnosis, 
prognosis, and treatment. This study assessed PET biomarkers, including brain 
glucose metabolism, tau, and amyloid load, in a series of comparable aMCI at 
baseline, clinically evaluated at follow-up.
METHODS: We included 72 aMCI subjects from Geneva Memory Center (N = 31) and 
ADNI cohorts (N = 41), selected based on available FDG-PET, tau-PET, 
amyloid-PET, and clinical follow-up (2.3 years ± 1.2). A data-driven algorithm 
classified brain metabolic patterns into subtypes that were then compared for 
clinical and PET biomarker measures and cognitive decline. Voxel-wise 
comparisons were performed both with FDG-PET and tau-PET data.
RESULTS: The algorithm classified three metabolic subtypes, namely 
"Hippocampal-sparing with cortical hypometabolism" (Type1; N = 27), "Hippocampal 
and cortical hypometabolism" (Type 2; N = 23), and "Medial temporal 
hypometabolism" (Type 3; N = 22). Amyloid positivity and tau accumulation in the 
medial temporal and neocortical regions characterized Type 1 and Type 2, whereas 
Type 3 showed no significant tau pathology, variable amyloid positivity, and 
stability at follow-up. All tau-positive patients, independently of the 
FDG-based subtype, showed faster cognitive decline.
INTERPRETATION: aMCI subjects can differ in metabolic patterns, tau and amyloid 
pathology, and clinical progression. Here, we complemented with PET tau 
biomarker the specific brain hypometabolic patterns at the individual level in 
the prodromal phase, contributing to the patient's classification. Tau PET is 
the most accurate biomarker in supporting or excluding the AD diagnosis in aMCI 
across metabolic subtypes and also predicting the risk of decline.

BACKGROUND: In the 2018 AT(N) framework, neurodegenerative (N) biomarkers plays 
an essential role in the research and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD); 
however, the different choice of N may result in discordances.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare different potential N biomarkers.
METHODS: We examined these N biomarkers among 1,238 participants from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in their 1) diagnostic 
utility, 2) cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations between different N 
biomarkers and clinical variables, and 3) the conversion risk of different N 
profiles.
RESULTS: Six neurodegenerative biomarkers changed significantly from preclinical 
AD, through prodromal AD to AD dementia stage, thus they were chosen as the 
candidate N biomarkers: hippocampal volume (HV), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), total tau (T-tau), 
plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL), CSF NFL, and CSF neurogranin (Ng). 
Results indicated that FDG-PET not only had the greatest diagnostic utility in 
differentiating AD from controls (area under the curve: FDG-PET, 0.922), but 
also had the strongest association with cognitive scores. Furthermore, FDG-PET 
positive group showed the fastest memory decline (hazard ratio: FDG-PET, 3.45), 
which was also true even in the presence of amyloid-β pathology. Moreover, we 
observed great discordances between three valuable N biomarkers (FDG-PET, HV, 
and T-tau).
CONCLUSION: These results underline the importance of using FDG-PET as N in 
terms of cognitive decline and AD conversion, followed by HV, and could be a 
great complement to the AT(N) framework.

INTRODUCTION: This study reports a novel deep learning approach to predict mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) within three 
years using whole-brain fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography 
(PET) and cognitive scores (CS).
METHODS: This analysis consisted of 150 normal controls (CN), 257 MCI, and 205  
AD subjects from ADNI. FDG-PET and CS were obtained at MCI diagnosis to predict 
AD conversion within three years of MCI diagnosis using convolutional neural 
networks.
RESULTS: Neurocognitive scores predicted better than FDG-PET per se, but the 
best model was a combination of FDG-PET, age, and neurocognitive data, yielding 
an AUC of 0.785 ± 0.096 and a balanced accuracy of 0.733 ± 0.098. Saliency maps 
highlighted putamen, thalamus, inferior frontal gyrus, parietal operculum, 
precuneus cortices, calcarine cortices, temporal gyrus, and planum temporale to 
be important for prediction.
DISCUSSION: Deep learning accurately predicts MCI conversion to AD and provides 
neural correlates of brain regions associated with AD conversion.

Early identification of dementia in the early or late stages of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) is crucial for a timely diagnosis and slowing down the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) is 
considered a highly powerful diagnostic biomarker, but few approaches 
investigated the efficacy of focusing on localized PET-active areas for 
classification purposes. In this work, we propose a pipeline using learned 
features from semantically labelled PET images to perform group classification. 
A deformable multimodal PET-MRI registration method is employed to fuse an 
annotated MNI template to each patient-specific PET scan, generating a fully 
labelled volume from which 10 common regions of interest used for AD diagnosis 
are extracted. The method was evaluated on 660 subjects from the ADNI database, 
yielding a classification accuracy of 91.2% for AD versus NC when using random 
forests combining features from cross-sectional and follow-up exams. A 
considerable improvement in the early versus late MCI classification accuracy 
was achieved using FDG-PET compared to the AV-45 compound, yielding a 72.5% 
rate. The pipeline demonstrates the potential of exploiting longitudinal 
multiregion PET features to improve cognitive assessment.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a memory impairment among 
non-demented adults. It is a condition that increases the risk of dementia, 
notably due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI is heterogeneous and there is a 
need for novel diagnostic approaches. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) imaging provides robust AD biomarker characteristics, while 
anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer complementary 
information.
OBJECTIVE: Classify MCI and cognitively normal (CN) adults using FDG-PET images; 
predict individuals with MCI that convert to AD dementia; determine if MRI can 
achieve comparable performance to FDG-PET classification.
METHODS: Four ADNI cohorts were created. Cohort 1: 805 participants (MCI 
n = 455; CN n = 350) that underwent FDG-PET. FDG-PET images were inputs to a 
one-channel 3-dimensional (3D) DenseNet deep learning model. Cohort 2: 348 
participants (MCI n = 174; CN n = 174) with MRI and functional MRI. Cohort 3: 
overlapping cases from cohorts 1 and 2 (MCI n = 70; CN n = 70). Cohort 4: 336 
participants (MCI-converters n = 168; MCI-stable n = 168) with FDG-PET from 
cohort 1. The one/two-channel models' inputs were T1-weighted MRI and/or 
amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations images, with classification metrics 
evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The FDG-PET model achieved 88.02%±3.82 accuracy for MCI versus CN 
classification, with 88.70%±4.70 sensitivity and 87.14%±5.03 specificity. 
Neither MRI model outperformed the FDG-PET model, as the highest MRI-based 
accuracy was 76.86%±1.95. The FDG-PET model achieved 63.23%±4.68 accuracy in 
classifying MCI-converters versus MCI-stable.
CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET images produced the highest accuracy in classifying MCI 
versus CN. While MRI-based approaches were inferior to FDG-PET, multi-contrast 
MRI still offers value for neurodegeneration classification.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau proteins are considered as critical factors 
that affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Although many studies have conducted on these two proteins, little study has 
investigated the relationship between their spatial distributions. This study 
aims to explore the associations of spatial patterns between Aβ deposition and 
tau deposition in patients with MCI and normal control (NC).
METHODS: We used multimodality positron emission tomography (PET) data from a 
clinically heterogeneous population of patients with MCI and NC. All data were 
obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
containing information of 65 patients with MCI and 75 NC who both had undergone 
AV45 (Aβ) and AV1451 (tau) PET. To assess the spatial distribution of Aβ and tau 
deposition, we employed parallel independent component analysis (pICA), which 
enabled the joint analysis of multimodal imaging data. pICA was conducted to 
identify the significant difference and correlation relationship of brain 
networks between Aβ PET and tau PET in MCI and NC groups.
RESULTS: Our results revealed the strongly correlated network between Aβ PET and 
tau PET were colocalized with the default-mode network (DMN). Simultaneously, in 
comparison of the spatial distribution between Aβ PET and tau PET, it was found 
that the significant differences between MCI and NC were mainly distributed in 
DMN, cognitive control network and visual networks. The altered brain networks 
obtained from pICA analysis are consistent with the abnormalities of brain 
network in MCI patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested the abnormal spatial distribution regions of tau 
PET were correlated with the abnormal spatial distribution regions of Aβ PET, 
and both of which were located in DMN network. This study revealed that 
combining pICA with multimodal imaging data is an effective approach for 
distinguishing MCI patients from NC group.

Bio-imaging technologies allow scientists to collect large amounts of 
high-dimensional data from multiple heterogeneous sources for many biomedical 
applications. In the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), neuroimaging data, 
gene/protein expression data, etc., are often analyzed together to improve 
predictive power. Joint learning from multiple complementary data sources is 
advantageous, but feature-pruning and data source selection are critical to 
learn interpretable models from high-dimensional data. Often, the data collected 
has block-wise missing entries. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI), most subjects have MRI and genetic information, but only half 
have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures, a different half has FDG-PET; only some 
have proteomic data. Here we propose how to effectively integrate information 
from multiple heterogeneous data sources when data is block-wise missing. We 
present a unified "bi-level" learning model for complete multi-source data, and 
extend it to incomplete data. Our major contributions are: (1) our proposed 
models unify feature-level and source-level analysis, including several existing 
feature learning approaches as special cases; (2) the model for incomplete data 
avoids imputing missing data and offers superior performance; it generalizes to 
other applications with block-wise missing data sources; (3) we present 
efficient optimization algorithms for modeling complete and incomplete data. We 
comprehensively evaluate the proposed models including all ADNI subjects with at 
least one of four data types at baseline: MRI, FDG-PET, CSF and proteomics. Our 
proposed models compare favorably with existing approaches.

BACKGROUND: Inconsistent positivity thresholds, image analysis pipelines, and 
quantitative outcomes are key challenges of multisite studies using more than 
one β-amyloid (Aβ) radiotracer in positron emission tomography (PET). 
Variability related to these factors contributes to disagreement and lack of 
replicability in research and clinical trials. To address these problems and 
promote Aβ PET harmonization, we used [18F]florbetaben (FBB) and 
[18F]florbetapir (FBP) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) to derive (1) standardized Centiloid (CL) transformations and (2) 
internally consistent positivity thresholds based on separate young control 
samples.
METHODS: We analyzed Aβ PET data using a native-space, automated image 
processing pipeline that is used for PET quantification in many large, multisite 
AD studies and trials and made available to the research community. With this 
pipeline, we derived SUVR-to-CL transformations using the Global Alzheimer's 
Association Interactive Network data; we used reference regions for 
cross-sectional (whole cerebellum) and longitudinal (subcortical white matter, 
brain stem, whole cerebellum) analyses. Finally, we developed a FBB positivity 
threshold using an independent young control sample (N=62) with methods parallel 
to our existing FBP positivity threshold and validated the FBB threshold using a 
data-driven approach in ADNI participants (N=295).
RESULTS: The FBB threshold based on the young sample (1.08; 18 CL) was 
consistent with that of the data-driven approach (1.10; 21 CL), and the existing 
FBP threshold converted to CL with the derived transformation (1.11; 20 CL). The 
following equations can be used to convert whole cerebellum- (cross-sectional) 
and composite- (longitudinal) normalized FBB and FBP data quantified with the 
native-space pipeline to CL units: [18F]FBB: CLwhole 
cerebellum = 157.15 × SUVRFBB - 151.87; threshold=1.08, 18 CL [18F]FBP: CLwhole 
cerebellum = 188.22 × SUVRFBP - 189.16; threshold=1.11, 20 CL [18F]FBB: 
CLcomposite = 244.20 × SUVRFBB - 170.80 [18F]FBP: 
CLcomposite = 300.66 × SUVRFBP - 208.84 CONCLUSIONS: FBB and FBP positivity 
thresholds derived from independent young control samples and quantified using 
an automated, native-space approach result in similar CL values. These findings 
are applicable to thousands of available and anticipated outcomes analyzed using 
this pipeline and shared with the scientific community. This work demonstrates 
the feasibility of harmonized PET acquisition and analysis in multisite PET 
studies and internal consistency of positivity thresholds in standardized units.

Sensitive and reliable in vivo imaging of the locus coeruleus (LC) is important 
to develop and evaluate its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is not known whether AD-related 
alterations in LC integrity can be detected using 18F-labelled 
fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Mean FDG-PET 
images from AD patients (N ​= ​193) and controls (N ​= ​256) from the ADNI 
database were co-registered to a study-wise anatomical template. Regional LC 
median standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values were obtained using four 
previously published LC masks and normalized to values from pons and cerebellar 
vermis reference regions. To support the validity of our methods, other regions 
previously reported to be most and least affected metabolically in AD were also 
compared to controls. The LC did not show between-group differences in FDG-PET 
signal, whereas the mammillary bodies did, despite these regions having 
comparable volumes and SUVR ranges. Brain regions previously reported to be most 
and least affected metabolically in AD compared to controls showed 
medium-to-large and small effect sizes for SUVR differences respectively. The 
results do not support the current application of LC FDG-PET signal as an in 
vivo biomarker for AD. Methodological and demographic factors potentially 
contributing to these findings are discussed. Future research may investigate 
age-related differences in LC FDG-PET signal and higher resolution images to 
fully explore its biomarker potential.

BACKGROUND: Reduced signal on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) is a valid proxy for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Perivascular space (PVS) is believed to be associated with AD pathology and 
cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associations of PVS with FDG-PET 
and cognitive performance based on the burden of amyloid pathology.
METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). MRI-visible PVS in basal ganglia (BG) 
and centrum semi-oval (CSO) were visually classified as: none/mild, moderate or 
frequent/severe. The association of PVS with brain FDG-PET was explored based on 
the burden of amyloid pathology, where a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) t-tau/Aβ42 
with the ratio≥0.27 was defined as high amyloid pathology. Moreover, the 
relationships between PVS and cognitive performance variables (ADNI-MEM and 
ADNI-EF) were studied.
RESULTS: For participants with higher tau/Aβ42 ratio, CSO-PVS severity was 
independently associated with lower FDG-PET. There were significant interaction 
effects between moderate or frequent/severe CSO-PVS and time on FDG decline in 
people with high amyloid pathology. The interaction between CSO-PVS and time 
(follow-up) was consistently associated with ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF decline in 
individuals with high amyloid pathology.
CONCLUSION: The study established the differential utility of PVS in BG and CSO 
for predicting brain metabolism. These findings suggest that CSO-PVS serves as a 
contributing factor to brain metabolism and cognitive decline associated with 
amyloid pathology.

Community and rich-club detection are a well-known method to extract 
functionally specialized subnetwork in brain connectivity analysis. They find 
densely connected subregions with large modularity or high degree in brain 
connectivity studies. However, densely connected nodes are not the only 
representation of network shape. In this study, we propose a new method to 
extract abnormal holes, which are another representation of network shape. While 
densely connected component characterizes network's efficiency, abnormal holes 
characterize inefficiency. The proposed method differs from the existing hole 
detection in two respects. One is to use Hodge Laplacian to obtain a harmonic 
hole in the linear combination of edges, rather than a subset of edges. The 
other is to use the kernel density estimation of persistence diagram of random 
networks to determine the significance of a hole, rather than using the 
persistence of a hole. We applied the proposed method to find the abnormality of 
metabolic connectivity in the FDG PET data of ADNI. We found that, as AD 
severely progressed, the brain network had more abnormal holes. The localized 
holes showed how inefficient the structure of brain network became as the 
disease progressed.

INTRODUCTION: Magnet resonance image (MRI)-based segmentations are widely used 
for clinical brain research, especially in conjunction with 
positron-emission-tomography (PET). Although artifacts due to segmentation 
errors arise commonly, the impact of these artifacts on PET quantitation has not 
yet been investigated systematically. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
assess the effect of segmentation errors on [(18)F]-AV45 and [(18)F]-FDG PET 
quantitation, with and without correction for partial volume effects (PVE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 119 subjects with both [(18)F]-AV45, and [(18)F]-FDG PET 
as well as T1-weighted MRI at baseline and at two-year follow-up were selected 
from the ADNI cohort, and their MRI brain images were segmented using PMOD 3.5. 
MRIs with segmentation artifacts were masked with the corresponding [(18)F]-FDG 
PET standard-uptake-value (SUV) images to elucidate and quantify the impact of 
artifacts on PET analyses for six defined volumes-of-interest (VOI). Artifact 
volumes were calculated for each VOI, together with error-[%] and 
root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) in uncorrected and PVE corrected SUV results for 
the two PET tracers. We also assessed the bias in longitudinal PET data.
RESULTS: Artifacts occurred most frequently in the parietal cortex VOI. For 
[(18)F]-AV45 and [(18)F]-FDG PET, the percentage-errors were dependent on 
artifact volumes. PVEC SUVs were consequently more distorted than were their 
uncorrected counterparts. In static and longitudinal assessment, a small 
subgroup of subjects with large artifacts (≥1500 voxels; ≙5.06 cm³) accounted 
for much of the PET quantitation bias.
CONCLUSION: Large segmentation artifacts need to be detected and resolved as 
they considerably bias PET quantitation, especially when PVEC is applied to PET 
data.

Plasma phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) showed the potential for Alzheimer's 
diagnosis and prognosis, but its role in detecting cerebral pathologies is 
unclear. We aimed to evaluate whether it could serve as a marker for Alzheimer's 
pathology in the brain. A total of 1189 participants with plasma p-tau181 and 
PET data of amyloid, tau or FDG PET were included from ADNI. Cross-sectional 
relationships of plasma p-tau181 with PET biomarkers were tested. 
Longitudinally, we further investigated whether different p-tau181 levels at 
baseline predicted different progression of Alzheimer's pathological changes in 
the brain. We found plasma p-tau181 significantly correlated with brain amyloid 
(Spearman ρ = 0.45, P < 0.0001), tau (0.25, P = 0.0003), and FDG PET uptakes 
(-0.37, P < 0.0001), and increased along the Alzheimer's continuum. 
Individually, plasma p-tau181 could detect abnormal amyloid, tau pathologies and 
hypometabolism in the brain, similar with or even better than clinical 
indicators. The diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 elevated significantly 
when combined with clinical information (AUC = 0.814 for amyloid PET, 0.773 for 
tau PET, and 0.708 for FDG PET). Relationships of plasma p-tau181 with brain 
pathologies were partly or entirely mediated by the corresponding CSF 
biomarkers. Besides, individuals with abnormal plasma p-tau181 level 
(>18.85 pg/ml) at baseline had a higher risk of pathological progression in 
brain amyloid (HR: 2.32, 95%CI 1.32-4.08) and FDG PET (3.21, 95%CI 2.06-5.01) 
status. Plasma p-tau181 may be a sensitive screening test for detecting brain 
pathologies, and serve as a predictive biomarker for Alzheimer's 
pathophysiology.

The assessment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) 
associated with brain changes remains a challenging task. Recent studies have 
demonstrated that combination of multi-modality imaging techniques can better 
reflect pathological characteristics and contribute to more accurate diagnosis 
of AD and MCI. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor-based multi-modality 
feature selection and regression method for diagnosis and biomarker 
identification of AD and MCI from normal controls. Specifically, we leverage the 
tensor structure to exploit high-level correlation information inherent in the 
multi-modality data, and investigate tensor-level sparsity in the multilinear 
regression model. We present the practical advantages of our method for the 
analysis of ADNI data using three imaging modalities (VBM-MRI, FDG-PET and 
AV45-PET) with clinical parameters of disease severity and cognitive scores. The 
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method 
against the state-of-the-art for the disease diagnosis and the identification of 
disease-specific regions and modality-related differences. The code for this 
work is publicly available at https://github.com/junfish/BIOS22.

BACKGROUND: Little is known of possible associations between Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) biomarkers and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) change over 
time.
OBJECTIVE: The present study seeks to identify relationships between baseline 
imaging and fluid biomarker profiles, and decline in IADL utilizing data 
collated from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: Generalized estimating equations analysis, adjusted for cognitive 
deterioration, was applied to a cohort of 509 individuals from all stages of 
ADNI, including 156 healthy controls, 189 early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
patients and 164 MCI patients.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between baseline biomarkers, 
specifically CSF Aβ and FDG PET, and IADL change over a 3-year period in 
individuals with MCI. Importantly, comparable correlations between presence of 
pathological biomarker levels and temporal decline in both functional and 
cognitive performance were also noted.
DISCUSSION: We show that distinct baseline biomarkers may predict latent changes 
in IADL. Our results necessitate a revision of the commonly held view upholding 
cognitive changes as the predominant endpoint measure associated with presence 
of abnormal baseline biomarkers.

The purpose of this project is to develop and validate a Deep Learning (DL) FDG 
PET imaging algorithm able to identify patients with any neurodegenerative 
diseases (Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD) or 
Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)) among patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI). A 3D Convolutional neural network was trained using images from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The ADNI dataset 
used for the model training and testing consisted of 822 subjects (472 AD and 
350 MCI). The validation was performed on an independent dataset from La Fe 
University and Polytechnic Hospital. This dataset contained 90 subjects with 
MCI, 71 of them developed a neurodegenerative disease (64 AD, 4 FTD and 3 DLB) 
while 19 did not associate any neurodegenerative disease. The model had 79% 
accuracy, 88% sensitivity and 71% specificity in the identification of patients 
with neurodegenerative diseases tested on the 10% ADNI dataset, achieving an 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90. On the 
external validation, the model preserved 80% balanced accuracy, 75% sensitivity, 
84% specificity and 0.86 AUC. This binary classifier model based on FDG PET 
images allows the early prediction of neurodegenerative diseases in MCI patients 
in standard clinical settings with an overall 80% classification balanced 
accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the present study were to investigate (1) whether 
trinary visual interpretation of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging (negative/equivocal/positive) reflects quantitative amyloid measurements 
and the time course of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) amyloid accumulation, and 
(2) whether visually equivocal scans represent an early stage of the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) continuum in terms of an intermediate state of quantitative amyloid 
measurements and the changes in amyloid accumulation over time.
METHODS: From the National Bioscience Database Center Human Database of the 
Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we selected 133 
individuals for this study including 33 with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), 
52 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 48 cognitively normal (CN) 
subjects who underwent clinical assessment, PiB PET, and structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with 2 or 3-years of follow-up. Sixty-eight of the 133 
individuals underwent cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 (CSF-Ab42) analysis at 
baseline. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of PiB PET was calculated with 
a method using MRI at each visit. The cross-sectional values, longitudinal 
changes in SUVR, and baseline CSF-Ab42 were compared among groups, which were 
categorized based on trinary visual reads of amyloid PET 
(negative/equivocal/positive).
RESULTS: From the trinary visual interpretation of the PiB PET images, 55 
subjects were negative, 8 were equivocal, and 70 were positive. Negative 
interpretation was most frequent in the CN group (70.8/10.4/18.8%: 
negative/equivocal/positive), and positive was most frequent in the LMCI group 
(34.6/1.9/63.5%) and in the ADD group (9.1/6.1/84.8%). The baseline SUVRs were 
1.08 ± 0.06 in the negative group, 1.23 ± 0.15 in the equivocal group, and 
1.86 ± 0.31 in the positive group (F = 174.9, p < 0.001). The baseline CSF-Ab42 
level was 463 ± 112 pg/mL in the negative group, 383 ± 125 pg/mL in the 
equivocal group, and 264 ± 69 pg/mL in the positive group (F = 37, p < 0.001). 
Over the 3-year follow-up, annual changes in SUVR were - 0.00 ± 0.02 in the 
negative group, 0.02 ± 0.02 in the equivocal group, and 0.04 ± 0.07 in the 
positive group (F = 8.4, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Trinary visual interpretation (negative/equivocal/positive) of 
amyloid PET imaging reflects quantitative amyloid measurements evaluated with 
PET and the CSF amyloid test as well as the amyloid accumulation over time 
evaluated with PET over 3 years. Subjects in the early stage of the AD continuum 
could be identified with an equivocal scan, because they showed intermediate 
quantitative amyloid PET, CSF measurements, and the amyloid accumulation over 
time.

Posterior cortical hypometabolism measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET 
is a well-known marker of Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration, but its 
associations with underlying neuropathological processes are unclear. We 
assessed cross-sectionally the relative contributions of three potential 
mechanisms causing hypometabolism in the retrosplenial and inferior parietal 
cortices: local molecular (amyloid and tau) pathology and atrophy, distant 
factors including contributions from the degenerating medial temporal lobe or 
molecular pathology in functionally connected regions, and the presence of the 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. Two hundred and thirty-two amyloid-positive 
cognitively impaired patients from two cohorts [University of California, San 
Francisco (UCSF), and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)] 
underwent MRI and PET with FDG, amyloid-PET using 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B, 
18F-florbetapir or 18F-florbetaben, and 18F-flortaucipir tau-PET in 1 year. 
Standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated using tracer-specific 
reference regions. Regression analyses were run within cohorts to identify 
variables associated with retrosplenial or inferior parietal FDG standard uptake 
value ratios. On average, ADNI patients were older and were less impaired than 
the UCSF patients. Regional patterns of hypometabolism were similar between 
cohorts, although there were cohort differences in regional grey matter atrophy. 
Local cortical thickness and tau-PET (but not amyloid-PET) were independently 
associated with both retrosplenial and inferior parietal FDG SUVRs (ΔR2 = 0.09 
to 0.21) across cohorts in models that also included age and disease severity 
(local model). Including medial temporal lobe volume improved the retrosplenial 
FDG model in the ADNI cohort (ΔR2 = 0.04, P = 0.008) but not for the UCSF (ΔR2 < 
0.01, P = 0.52), and did not improve the inferior parietal models (ΔR2 < 0.01, P 
> 0.37). Interaction analyses revealed that medial temporal volume was more 
strongly associated with retrosplenial FDG SUVRs at earlier disease stages (P = 
0.06 in UCSF, P = 0.046 in ADNI). Exploratory analyses across the cortex 
confirmed overall associations between hypometabolism and local tau pathology 
and thickness and revealed associations between medial temporal degeneration and 
hypometabolism in retrosplenial, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. 
Finally, our data did not support hypotheses of a detrimental effect of 
pathology in connected regions or of an effect of the APOE ε4 allele in impaired 
participants. Overall, in two independent groups of patients at symptomatic 
stages of Alzheimer's disease, cortical hypometabolism mainly reflected 
structural neurodegeneration and tau, but not amyloid, pathology.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental benefit of biomarkers for 
prediction of Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) when added stepwise in the order of their collection in 
clinical routine. The model started with cognitive status characterized by the 
ADAS-13 score. Hippocampus volume (HV), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau 
(pTau), and the FDG t-sum score in an AD meta-region-of-interest were compared 
as neurodegeneration markers. CSF-Aβ1-42 was used as amyloidosis marker. The 
incremental prognostic benefit from these markers was assessed by stepwise 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in 402 ADNI MCI subjects. Predefined cutoffs were 
used to dichotomize patients as 'negative' or 'positive' for AD characteristic 
alteration with respect to each marker. Among the neurodegeneration markers, 
CSF-pTau provided the best incremental risk stratification when added to 
ADAS-13. FDG PET outperformed HV only in MCI subjects with relatively preserved 
cognition. Adding CSF-Aβ provided further risk stratification in pTau-positive 
subjects, independent of their cognitive status. Stepwise integration of 
biomarkers allows stepwise refinement of risk estimates for MCI-to-ADD 
progression. Incremental benefit strongly depends on the patient's status 
according to the preceding diagnostic steps. The stepwise Kaplan-Meier curves 
might be useful to optimize diagnostic workflow in individual patients.

Radiogenomics of Alzheimer's disease: exploring gene related metabolic imaging 
markers.

Huang Y, Li L, Jiang J.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and 
considerably determined by genetic factors. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) can reflect the functional state of glucose metabolism in 
the brain, and radiomic features of FDG-PET were considered as important imaging 
markers in AD. However, radiomic features are not highly interpretable, 
especially lack of explanation of underlying biological and molecular 
mechanisms. Therefore, this study used radiogenomics analysis to explore 
prognostic metabolic imaging markers by associating radiomics features and 
genetic data. In the study, we used the FDG-PET images and genotype data of 389 
subjects (Cohort B) enrolled in the ADNI, including 109 AD, 134 healthy controls 
(HCs), 72 MCI non-converters (MCI-nc) and 74 MCI converters (MCI-c). Firstly, we 
performed a Genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the genotype data of 998 
subjects (Cohort A), including 632 AD and 366 HCs after quality control (QC) 
steps to identify susceptibility loci as the gene features. Secondly, radiomics 
features were extracted from the preprocessed PET images. Thirdly, two-sample 
t-test, rank sum test and F-score were regarded as the feature selection step to 
select effective radiomic features. Fourthly, a support vector machine (SVM) was 
used to test the ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD 
patients. Finally, we performed the Spearman correlation analysis on the genetic 
data and radiomic features. As a result, we identified rs429358 and rs2075650 as 
genome-wide significant signals. The radiomic approach achieved good 
classification abilities. Two prognostic FDG-PET radiomic features in the 
amygdala were proven to be correlated with the genetic data.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Amyloid plaques are one of the physical hallmarks of 
Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study is to predict amyloid 
positivity non-invasively from FDG-PET images using a radiomics approach.
METHODS: We obtained FDG-PET images of 301 individuals from various groups, 
including control normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), from the ADNI database. Following the utilization of the CSF 
Aβ1-42 (192) and Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) (1.11) thresholds 
derived from Florbetapir scans, the subjects were categorized into two 
categories: those with a positive amyloid status (n = 185) and those with a 
negative amyloid status (n = 116). The process of segmenting the entire brain 
into 95 classes using the DKT-atlas was utilized. Following that, we obtained 
120 characteristics for each of the 95 regions of interest (ROIs). We employed 
eight feature selection methods to analyze the features. Additionally, we 
utilized eight different classifiers on the 20 most significant features 
extracted from each feature selection method. Finally, in order to improve 
interpretability, we selected the most important features and ROIs.
RESULT: We found that the GNB classifier and the LASSO feature selection method 
had the best performance with an average accuracy of (AUC=0.924) while using 18 
features on 15 ROIs. We were then able to reduce the model to three regions 
(Hippocampus, inferior parietal, and isthmus cingulate) and three gray-level 
based features (AUC=0.853).
CONCLUSION: The FDG-PET images which serve to study metabolic activity can be 
used to predict amyloid positivity without the use of invasive methods or 
another PET tracer and study. The proposed method has superior prediction 
accuracy with respect to similar studies reported in the literature using other 
imaging modalities. Only three brain regions had a high impact on amyloid 
positivity results.

BACKGROUND: Hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been linked to more 
severe cognitive and functional decline. However, research on visual 
hallucinations (VH), the most common type of hallucinations in AD, is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cognitive and cerebral macrostructural and 
metabolic features associated with VH in AD.
METHODS: Twenty-four AD patients with VH, 24 with no VH (NVH), and 24 
cognitively normal (CN) matched controls were selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Differences in regional gray 
matter (GM) volumes and cognitive performance were investigated with whole brain 
voxel-based morphometry analyses of MRI structural brain scans, and analyses of 
neuropsychological tests. Glucose metabolic changes were explored in a 
sub-sample of patients who had FDG-PET scans available.
RESULTS: More severe visuoconstructive and attentional deficits were found in AD 
VH compared with NVH. GM atrophy and hypometabolism were detected in occipital 
and temporal areas in VH patients in comparison with CN. On the other hand, NVH 
patients had atrophy and hypometabolism mainly in temporal areas. No differences 
in GM volume and glucose metabolism were found in the direct comparison between 
AD VH and NVH.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the pattern of brain abnormalities typical of AD, 
occipital alterations were observed in patients with VH compared with CN. More 
severe visuoconstructive and attentional deficits were found in AD VH when 
directly compared with NVH, and might contribute to the emergence of VH in AD.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to develop a deep neural network to diagnosis 
Alzheimer's disease and categorize the stages of the disease using FDG-PET 
scans. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a highly 
effective diagnostic tool that accurately detects glucose metabolism in the 
brain of AD patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this work, we have developed a deep neural network 
using FDG-PET to discriminate Alzheimer's disease subjects from stable mild 
cognitive impairment (sMCI), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), and 
cognitively normal (CN) cohorts. A total of 83 FDG-PET scans are collected from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 21 
subjects with CN, 21 subjects with sMCI, 21 subjects with pMCI, and 20 subjects 
with AD.
RESULTS: The method has achieved remarkable accuracy rates of 99.31% for CN vs. 
AD, 99.88% for CN vs. MCI, 99.54% for AD vs. MCI, and 96.81% for pMCI vs. sMCI. 
Based on the experimental results.
CONCLUSION: The results show that the proposed method has a significant 
generalisation ability as well as good performance in predicting the conversion 
of MCI to AD even in the absence of direct information. FDG-PET is a well-known 
biomarker for the identification of Alzheimer's disease using transfer learning.

Background and Objectives: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission 
tomography (PET) (PETFDG) image can visualize neuronal injury of the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease. Early-phase amyloid PET image is reported to be similar to 
PETFDG image. This study aimed to generate PETFDG images from 18F-florbetaben 
PET (PETFBB) images using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and compare the 
generated PETFDG (PETGE-FDG) with real PETFDG (PETRE-FDG) images using the 
structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and the peak signal-to-noise ratio 
(PSNR). Materials and Methods: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, 110 participants with both PETFDG and PETFBB images 
at baseline were included. The paired PETFDG and PETFBB images included six and 
four subset images, respectively. Each subset image had a 5 min acquisition 
time. These subsets were randomly sampled and divided into 249 paired PETFDG and 
PETFBB subset images for the training datasets and 95 paired subset images for 
the validation datasets during the deep-learning process. The deep learning 
model used in this study is composed of a GAN with a U-Net. The differences in 
the SSIM and PSNR values between the PETGE-FDG and PETRE-FDG images in the 
cycleGAN and pix2pix models were evaluated using the independent Student's 
t-test. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: The participant 
demographics (age, sex, or diagnosis) showed no statistically significant 
differences between the training (82 participants) and validation (28 
participants) groups. The mean SSIM between the PETGE-FDG and PETRE-FDG images 
was 0.768 ± 0.135 for the cycleGAN model and 0.745 ± 0.143 for the pix2pix 
model. The mean PSNR was 32.4 ± 9.5 and 30.7 ± 8.0. The PETGE-FDG images of the 
cycleGAN model showed statistically higher mean SSIM than those of the pix2pix 
model (p < 0.001). The mean PSNR was also higher in the PETGE-FDG images of the 
cycleGAN model than those of pix2pix model (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We 
generated PETFDG images from PETFBB images using deep learning. The cycleGAN 
model generated PETGE-FDG images with a higher SSIM and PSNR values than the 
pix2pix model. Image-to-image translation using deep learning may be useful for 
generating PETFDG images. These may provide additional information for the 
management of Alzheimer's disease without extra image acquisition and the 
consequent increase in radiation exposure, inconvenience, or expenses.

BACKGROUND: While fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and amyloid PET is valuable for 
patient management, research, and clinical trial of therapeutics on Alzheimer's 
disease, the specific details of the PET scanning method including the PET 
camera model type influence the image quality, which may further affect the 
interpretation of images and quantitative capabilities. To make multicenter PET 
data reliable and to establish PET scanning as a universal diagnostic technique 
and a verified biomarker, we have proposed phantom test procedures and criteria 
for optimizing image quality across different PET cameras.
RESULTS: As the method, four physical parameters (resolution, gray-white 
contrast, uniformity, and image noise) were selected as essential to image 
quality for brain FDG and amyloid PET and were measured with a Hoffman 3D brain 
phantom and a uniform cylindrical phantom on a total of 12 currently used PET 
models. The phantom radioactivity and acquisition time were determined based on 
the standard scanning protocol for each PET drug (FDG, 11C-PiB, 18F-florbetapir, 
and 18F-flutemetamol). Reconstruction parameters were either determined based on 
the methods adopted in ADNI, J-ADNI, and other research and clinical trials or 
optimized based on measured phantom image parameters under various 
reconstruction conditions. As the result, phantom test criteria were proposed as 
follows: (i) 8 mm FWHM or better resolution and (ii) gray/white %contrast ≥55 % 
with the Hoffman 3D brain phantom and (iii) SD of 51 small region of interests 
(ROIs) ≤0.0249 (equivalent to 5 % variation) for uniformity and (iv) image noise 
(SD/mean) ≤15 % for a large ROI with the uniform cylindrical phantom. These 
criteria provided image quality conforming to those multicenter clinical studies 
and were also achievable with most of the PET cameras that are currently used.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed phantom test criteria facilitate standardization and 
qualification of brain FDG and amyloid PET images and deserve further evaluation 
by future multicenter clinical studies.

The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) are frequently used indices of cognitive 
decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to compare 
FDG-PET and clinical measurements in a large sample of elderly subjects with 
memory disturbance. We examined relationships between glucose metabolism in 
FDG-PET regions of interest (FDG-ROIs), and ADAS-cog and FAQ scores in AD and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Low glucose metabolism at baseline predicted 
subsequent ADAS-cog and FAQ decline. In addition, longitudinal glucose 
metabolism decline was associated with concurrent ADAS-cog and FAQ decline. 
Finally, a power analysis revealed that FDG-ROI values have greater statistical 
power than ADAS-cog to detect attenuation of cognitive decline in AD and MCI 
patients. Glucose metabolism is a sensitive measure of change in cognition and 
functional ability in AD and MCI, and has value in predicting future cognitive 
decline.

Multimodal data-based classification methods have been widely used in the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have achieved better performance than 
single-modal-based methods. However, most classification methods based on 
multimodal data tend to consider only the correlation between different modal 
data and ignore the inherent non-linear higher-order relationships between 
similar data, which can improve the robustness of the model. Therefore, this 
study proposes a hypergraph p-Laplacian regularized multi-task feature selection 
(HpMTFS) method for AD classification. Specifically, feature selection for each 
modal data is considered as a distinct task and the common features of 
multimodal data are extracted jointly by group-sparsity regularizer. In 
particular, two regularization terms are introduced in this study, namely (1) a 
hypergraph p-Laplacian regularization term to retain higher-order structural 
information for similar data, and (2) a Frobenius norm regularization term to 
improve the noise immunity of the model. Finally, using a multi-kernel support 
vector machine to fuse multimodal features and perform the final classification. 
We used baseline sMRI, FDG-PET, and AV-45 PET imaging data from 528 subjects in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to evaluate our approach. 
Experimental results show that our HpMTFS method outperforms existing 
multimodal-based classification methods.

BACKGROUND: There are contradictory findings regarding the effect of statin 
drugs on amyloid β (Aβ) deposition as one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), along with tau pathology. We aimed to longitudinally investigate 
the therapeutic and preventive role of statin drugs by examining the brain Aβ 
deposition and metabolism rate in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: The data of 828 subjects including 178 HC, 492 MCI, and 158 AD 
individuals were obtained from ADNI. The baseline and longitudinal [18 F] AV45 
and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) measures 
were investigated among statin users and non-users.
RESULTS: Our results showed that there is no significant difference in baseline 
Aβ deposition and metabolism rate between statin users and non-users among HC, 
MCI, and AD subjects. While there was no significant effect of statin on 
metabolism rate, there was a significant difference in Aβ deposition change 
after 4 years (from baseline) between statin users and non-users within HC 
subjects (p = 0.011). The change of Aβ deposition at 4 years from baseline was 
-2.0 ± 6.3% for statin users and 1.4 ± 4.7% for non-users. There was no 
significant association between statin duration use with baseline and 
longitudinal Aβ deposition and metabolism rate. However, statin dosage was 
significantly associated with Aβ deposition in 2 years (r = -0.412, p = 0.021) 
in the HC group. Moreover, our analysis showed a significant correlation between 
total statin exposure (duration×dosage) and Aβ deposition in 2 years visit 
(r = -0.198, p = 0.037) in HC subjects. Furthermore, we investigated the 
longitudinal changes within each group of statin users and non-users separately 
in linear mixed models. Our findings showed that there are no significant 
changes in AV45 and FDG SUVR among both groups.
CONCLUSION: The present longitudinal analysis revealed that using statins might 
be beneficial in slowing down or stabilizing the Aβ deposition due to aging in 
subjects without cognitive impairment. However, once the clinical symptoms of 
cognitive impairment appear, statins fail to slow down Aβ deposition. Overall, 
our findings revealed that statin users might have slower Aβ aggregation than 
non-users.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is providing critical new 
information on biomarkers in cognitively normal elderly, persons with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
data provide insights into the progression of the pathology of AD over time, 
assist in understanding which biomarkers might be most useful in clinical 
trials, and facilitate development of disease-modifying treatments. ADNI results 
are intended to support new AD treatment development; this report considers how 
ADNI information can be integrated in AD drug development programs. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta protein (Abeta) measures can be used in 
Phase I studies to detect any short term effects on Abeta levels in the CSF. 
Phase II studies may benefit most from biomarker measures that can inform 
decisions about Phase III. CSF Abeta levels, CSF total tau and phospho-tau 
measures, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), Pittsburgh 
Compound B (PIB) amyloid imaging, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be 
employed to select patients in enriched trials or as outcomes for specific 
disease-modifying interventions. Use of biomarkers may allow Phase II trials to 
be conducted more efficiently with smaller populations of patients or shorted 
treatment times. New drug applications (NDAs) may include biomarker outcomes of 
phase III trials. ADNI patients are highly educated and are nearly all of 
Caucasian ethnicity limiting the generalizability of the results to other 
populations commonly included in global clinical trials. ADNI has inspired or 
collaborates with biomarker investigations worldwide and together these studies 
will provide biomarker information that can reduce development times and costs, 
improve drug safety, optimize drug efficacy, and bring new treatments to 
patients with or at risk for AD.

The study aims to implement a convolutional neural network framework that uses 
the 18F-FDG PET modality of brain imaging to detect multiple stages of dementia, 
including Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) and Late Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Cognitively Normal (CN), 
and assess the results. 18F-FDG PET imaging modality for brain were procured 
from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative's (ADNI) repository. The 
ResNet50V2 model layers were utilised for feature extraction, with the final 
convolutional layers fine-tuned for this dataset's multi-classification 
objectives. Multiple metrics and feature maps were utilized to scrutinize and 
evaluate the model's statistical and qualitative inference. The 
multi-classification model achieved an overarching accuracy of 98.44% and Area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 95% on the testing set. 
Feature maps aided in deducing finer aspects of the model's overall operation. 
This framework helped classifying from the 18F-FDG PET brain images, the 
subtypes of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) which include EMCI, LMCI, from AD, 
CN groups and achieved an all-inclusive sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 
95% respectively.

Objective. Brain18F-FDG PET images indicate brain lesions' metabolic status and 
offer the predictive potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
complexity of extracting relevant lesion features and dealing with extraneous 
information in PET images poses challenges for accurate prediction.Approach. To 
address these issues, we propose an innovative solution called the efficient 
adaptive multiscale network (EAMNet) for predicting potential patient 
populations using positron emission tomography (PET) image slices, enabling 
effective intervention and treatment. Firstly, we introduce an efficient 
convolutional strategy to enhance the receptive field of PET images during the 
feature learning process, avoiding excessive extraction of fine tissue features 
by deep-level networks while reducing the model's computational complexity. 
Secondly, we construct a channel attention module that enables the prediction 
model to adaptively allocate weights between different channels, compensating 
for the spatial noise in PET images' impact on classification. Finally, we use 
skip connections to merge features from different-scale lesion information. 
Through visual analysis, the network constructed in this article aligns with the 
regions of interest of clinical doctors.Main results. Through visualization 
analysis, our network aligns with regions of interest identified by clinical 
doctors. Experimental evaluations conducted on the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset demonstrate the outstanding classification 
performance of our proposed method. The accuracy rates for AD versus NC (Normal 
Controls), AD versus MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), MCI versus NC, and AD 
versus MCI versus NC classifications achieve 97.66%, 96.32%, 95.23%, and 95.68%, 
respectively.Significance. The proposed method surpasses advanced algorithms in 
the field, providing a hopeful advancement in accurately predicting and 
classifying Alzheimer's Disease using18F-FDG PET images. The source code has

Joint analysis of amyloid and metabolic PET patterns across healthy, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects was performed 
using baseline 18F-florbetapir and 18F-FDG PET of 684 subjects from the ADNI 
(251 normal, 204 stable MCI, 85 AD converters, and 144 AD). Correlation between 
regional amyloid and metabolic uptake was measured and predictive value of PET 
profile regarding AD conversion in cognitively impaired subjects was assessed 
using survival analysis and support vector machine classification (SVM). The 
highest correlations were found in the temporal cortex, precuneus, and posterior 
cingulum. With respect to normal controls, amyloid load increase was diffuse and 
early in MCI subjects, whereas metabolism decrease occurred later and 
predominated in temporo-parietal, precuneus, and cingulate cortices. Five-year 
AD conversion rates in cognitively impaired subjects were 5%, 22%, 42%, and 78% 
in amyloid-/FDG-, amyloid-/FDG+, amyloid+/FDG-, and amyloid+/FDG+ subjects 
respectively (mean follow-up 37±14 months). Using SVM, the combination of 
ADAS-cog score, amyloid PET, and FDG PET yielded better performance in 
predicting AD conversion (77% accuracy; 58% positive predictive value; 88% 
negative predictive value) than ADAS-cog (72%; 52%; 86%), amyloid PET (72%; 52%; 
87%), and FDG PET (67%; 47%; 84%). This study attests the complementary value of 
amyloid and FDG PET in MCI assessment and the efficiency of combined cognitive, 
amyloid, and metabolic scores to predict AD conversion.

In the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is used for 
its ability to detect functional changes at early stages of disease process. 
However, anatomical information from another modality (CT or MRI) is still 
needed to properly interpret and localize the radiotracer uptake due to its low 
spatial resolution. Lack of structural information limits segmentation and 
accurate quantification of the 18F-FDG PET/CT. The correct segmentation of the 
brain compartment in 18F-FDG PET/CT will enable the quantitative analysis of the 
18F-FDG PET/CT scan alone. In this paper, we propose a method to segment white 
matter in 18F-FDG PET/CT images using generative adversarial network (GAN). The 
segmentation result of GAN model was evaluated using evaluation parameters such 
as dice, AUC-PR, precision, and recall. It was also compared with other deep 
learning methods. As a result, the proposed method achieves superior 
segmentation accuracy and reliability compared with other deep learning methods.

BACKGROUND: Predicting the risk of disease progression from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has important clinical 
significance. This study aimed to provide a personalized MCI-to-AD conversion 
prediction via radiomics-based predictive modelling (RPM) with multicenter 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) data.
METHOD: FDG PET and neuropsychological data of 884 subjects were collected from 
Huashan Hospital, Xuanwu Hospital, and from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. First, 34,400 radiomic features were extracted from 
the 80 regions of interest (ROIs) for all PET images. These features were then 
concatenated for feature selection, and an RPM model was constructed and 
validated on the ADNI dataset. In addition, we used clinical data and the 
routine semiquantification index (standard uptake value ratio, SUVR) to 
establish clinical and SUVR Cox models for further comparison. FDG images from 
local hospitals were used to explore RPM performance in a separate cohort of 
individuals with healthy controls and different cognitive levels (a complete AD 
continuum). Finally, correlation analysis was conducted between the radiomic 
biomarkers and neuropsychological assessments.
RESULTS: The experimental results showed that the predictive performance of the 
RPM Cox model was better than that of other Cox models. In the validation 
dataset, Harrell's consistency coefficient of the RPM model was 0.703 ± 0.002, 
while those of the clinical and SUVR models were 0.632 ± 0.006 and 
0.683 ± 0.009, respectively. Moreover, most crucial imaging biomarkers were 
significantly different at different cognitive stages and significantly 
correlated with cognitive disease severity.
CONCLUSION: The preliminary results demonstrated that the developed RPM approach 
has the potential to monitor progression in high-risk populations with AD.

Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be mostly driven by 
tau neurofibrillary tangles. However, both tau and neurodegeneration exhibit 
variability in their distribution across the brain and among individuals, and 
the relationship between tau and neurodegeneration might be influenced by 
several factors. I aimed to map local molecular and connectivity characteristics 
that affect the association between tau pathology and neurodegeneration. The 
current study was conducted on the cross-sectional tau-PET and longitudinal 
T1-weighted MRI scan data of 186 participants from the ADNI dataset including 71 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 115 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals. 
Furthermore, the normative molecular profile of a region was defined using 
neurotransmitter receptor densities, gene expression, T1w/T2w ratio 
(myelination), FDG-PET (glycolytic index, glucose metabolism, and oxygen 
metabolism), and synaptic density. I found that the excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) 
ratio, myelination, synaptic density, glycolytic index, and functional 
connectivity are linked with deviation in the relationship between tau and 
neurodegeneration. Furthermore, there was spatial similarity between tau 
pathology and glycolytic index, synaptic density, and functional connectivity 
across brain regions. The current study demonstrates that the regional 
susceptibility to tau-related neurodegeneration is associated with specific 
molecular and connectomic characteristics of the affected neural systems. I 
found that the molecular and connectivity architecture of the human brain is 
linked to the different effects of tau pathology on downstream 
neurodegeneration.

In disorders of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
neurodegeneration is the final common pathway of disease progression. 
Modulating, reversing, or preventing disease progression is a clinical 
imperative most likely to succeed following accurate and explanatory 
understanding of neurodegeneration, requiring enhanced consistency with 
quantitative measurements and expanded interpretability of complex data. The 
on-going study of neurodegeneration has robustly demonstrated the advantages of 
accumulating large amounts of clinical data that include neuroimaging, motiving 
multi-center studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Demonstrative advantages also arise from highly multivariate analysis 
methods, and this work reports advances provided by non-negative matrix 
factorization (NMF). NMF revealed patterns of covariance for glucose metabolism, 
estimated by positron emission tomography of [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose, in 243 
healthy normal participants of ADNI. Patterns for glucose metabolism provided 
cross-sectional inferences for 860 total participants of ADNI with and without 
cerebral amyloidosis and clinical dementia ratings (CDR) ranging 0-3. Patterns 
for glucose metabolism were distinct in number and topography from patterns 
identified in previous studies of structural MRI. They were also distinct from 
well-establish topographies of resting-state neuronal networks mapped by 
functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patterns for glucose metabolism 
identified significant topographical landmarks relating age, sex, APOE ε4 
alleles, amyloidosis, CDR, and neurodegeneration. Patterns involving insular and 
orbitofrontal cortices, as well as midline regions of frontal and parietal lobes 
demonstrated the greatest neurodegeneration with progressive Alzheimer's 
dementia. A single pattern for the lateral parietal and posterior superior 
temporal cortices demonstrated preserved glucose metabolism for all diagnostic 
groups, including Alzheimer's dementia. Patterns correlated significantly with 
topical terms from the Neurosynth platform, thereby providing semantic 
representations for patterns such as attention, memory, language, fear/reward, 
movement and motor planning. In summary, NMF is a data-driven, principled, 
supervised statistical learning method that provides interpretable patterns of 
neurodegeneration. These patterns can help inform the understanding and 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: ▪ Data-driven non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) identified 24 
canonical patterns of spatial covariance of cerebral glucose metabolism. The 
training data comprised healthy older participants (CDR = 0 without amyloidosis) 
cross-sectionally drawn from ADNI. ▪ In healthy participants, mean SUVRs for 
specific patterns in precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, and subcortical areas 
including superficial white matter and striatum, demonstrated increasing glucose 
metabolism with advancing age. ▪ In asymptomatic participants with amyloidosis , 
glucose metabolism increased compared to those who were asymptomatic without 
amyloid , particularly in medial prefrontal cortex, frontoparietal cortex, 
occipital white, and posterior cerebellar regions. ▪ In symptomatic participants 
with amyloidosis , insular cortex, medial frontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex 
demonstrated the most severe losses of glucose metabolism with increasing CDR. 
Lateral parietal and posterior superior temporal cortices retained glucose 
metabolism even for CDR > 0.5. ▪ NMF models of glucose metabolism are consistent 
with models arising from principal components, or eigenbrains, while adding 
additional regional interpretability. ▪ NMF patterns correlated with regions 
catalogued in Neurosynth. Following corrections for spatial autocorrelations, 
NMF patterns revealed meta-analytic identifications of patterns with Neurosynth 
topics of fear/reward, attention, memory, language, and movement with motor 
planning. Patterns varied with degrees of cognitive impairment.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) beginning in October 
2004, is a 6-year research project that studies changes of cognition, function, 
brain structure and function, and biomarkers in elderly controls, subjects with 
mild cognitive impairment, and subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A major 
goal is to determine and validate MRI, PET images, and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF)/blood biomarkers as predictors and outcomes for use in clinical trials of 
AD treatments. Structural MRI, FDG PET, C-11 Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) PET, 
CSF measurements of amyloid beta (Abeta) and species of tau, with 
clinical/cognitive measurements were performed on elderly controls, subjects 
with mild cognitive impairment, and subjects with AD. Structural MRI shows high 
rates of brain atrophy, and has high statistical power for determining treatment 
effects. FDG PET, C-11 Pittsburgh compound B PET, and CSF measurements of Abeta 
and tau were significant predictors of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. All 
data are available at UCLA/LONI/ADNI, without embargo. ADNI-like projects 
started in Australia, Europe, Japan, and Korea. ADNI provides significant new 
information concerning the progression of AD.

BACKGROUND: Models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology posit that 
amyloidosis [A] precedes and accelerates tau pathology [T] that leads to 
neurodegeneration [N]. Besides this A-T-N sequence, other biomarker sequences 
are possible. This current work investigates and compares the longitudinal 
trajectories of Alzheimer's ATN biomarker profiles in non-demented elderly 
adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: Based on the ATN classification system, 262 individuals were identified 
before dementia diagnosis and accompanied by baseline and follow-up data of ATN 
biomarkers (CSF Aβ42, p-tau, and FDG-PET). We recorded the conversion processes 
in ATN biomarkers during follow-up, then analyzed the possible longitudinal 
trajectories and estimated the conversion rate and temporal evolution of 
biomarker changes. To evaluate how biomarkers changed over time, we used linear 
mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: During a 6-120-month follow-up period, there were four patterns of 
longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's ATN biomarker profiles, from all negative to 
positive through the course of the disease. The most common pattern is that A 
pathology biomarker first emerges. As well as the classical A-T-N sequence, 
other "A-first," "T-first," and "N-first" biomarker pathways were found. The 
N-A-T sequence had the fastest rate of pathological progression (mean 
65.00 months), followed by A-T-N (mean 67.07 months), T-A-N (mean 68.85 months), 
and A-N-T sequences (mean 98.14 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Our current work presents a comprehensive analysis of longitudinal 
trajectories of Alzheimer's ATN biomarkers in non-demented elderly adults. 
Stratifying disease into subtypes depending on the temporal evolution of 
biomarkers will benefit the early recognition and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with 
narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients 
with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 
markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile.
METHODS: Cognitive and 18 F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data 
were compared in patients with NT1 aged ≥ 65 years (n = 23) and in age- and 
sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention 
Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n = 23) cohorts. The 
standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions 
of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 
3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A 
cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ≥ 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.
RESULTS: Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI 
and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 ± 0.15, 
1.11 ± 0.18 [p < 0.0001], and 1.14 ± 0.17 [p = 0.0005], respectively). Similar 
results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all 
cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) 
had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the 
MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not 
associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile.
INTERPRETATION: Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18 F-florbetapir PET, in 
patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL

This study employed a deep learning longitudinal model, graph convolutional and 
recurrent neural network (graph-CNN-RNN), on a series of brain structural MRI 
scans for AD prognosis. It characterized whole-brain morphology via 
incorporating longitudinal cortical and subcortical morphology and defined a 
probabilistic risk for the prediction of AD as a function of age prior to 
clinical diagnosis. The graph-CNN-RNN model was trained on half of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset (ADNI, n = 1559) and 
validated on the other half of the ADNI dataset and the Open Access Series of 
Imaging Studies-3 (OASIS-3, n = 930). Our findings demonstrated that the 
graph-CNN-RNN can reliably and robustly diagnose AD at the accuracy rate of 85% 
and above across all the time points for both datasets. The graph-CNN-RNN 
predicted the AD conversion from 0 to 4 years before the AD onset at ∼80% of 
accuracy. The AD probabilistic risk was associated with clinical traits, 
cognition, and amyloid burden assessed using [18F]-Florbetapir (AV45) positron 
emission tomography (PET) across all the time points. The graph-CNN-RNN provided 
the quantitative trajectory of brain morphology from prognosis to overt stages 
of AD. Such a deep learning tool and the AD probabilistic risk have great 
potential in clinical applications for AD prognosis.

PURPOSE: An appropriate healthy control dataset is mandatory to achieve good 
performance in voxel-wise analyses. We aimed at evaluating [18F]FDG PET brain 
datasets of healthy controls (HC), based on publicly available data, for the 
extraction of voxel-based brain metabolism maps at the single-subject level.
METHODS: Selection of HC images was based on visual rating, after Cook's 
distance and jack-knife analyses, to exclude artefacts and/or outliers. The 
performance of these HC datasets (ADNI-HC and AIMN-HC) to extract hypometabolism 
patterns in single patients was tested in comparison with the standard reference 
HC dataset (HSR-HC) by means of Dice score analysis. We evaluated the 
performance and comparability of the different HC datasets in the assessment of 
single-subject SPM-based hypometabolism in three independent cohorts of 
patients, namely, ADD, bvFTD and DLB.
RESULTS: Two-step Cook's distance analysis and the subsequent jack-knife 
analysis resulted in the selection of n = 125 subjects from the AIMN-HC dataset 
and n = 75 subjects from the ADNI-HC dataset. The average concordance between 
SPM hypometabolism t-maps in the three patient cohorts, as obtained with the new 
datasets and compared to the HSR-HC standard reference dataset, was 0.87 for the 
AIMN-HC dataset and 0.83 for the ADNI-HC dataset. Pattern expression analysis 
revealed high overall accuracy (> 80%) of the SPM t-map classification according 
to different statistical thresholds and sample sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: The applied procedures ensure validity of these HC datasets for the 
single-subject estimation of brain metabolism using voxel-wise comparisons. 
These well-selected HC datasets are ready-to-use in research and clinical 
settings.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of metabolomics makes it possible to study the 
characteristic changes of peripheral metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Recent studies have found that the levels of valine are related to mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
AIMS: This study aimed to further clarify the characteristics of valine levels 
in MCI and AD.
METHODS: A total of 786 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort were selected to evaluate the relationships between 
serum valine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain structure (magnetic 
resonance imaging, MRI), cerebral glucose metabolism 
(18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, FDG-PET), and cognitive 
declines, through different cognitive subgroups.
RESULTS: Serum valine was decreased in patients with AD compared with cognitive 
normal (CN) and stable MCI (sMCI), and in progressive MCI (pMCI) compared with 
CN. Serum valine was negatively correlated with CSF total tau (t-tau) and 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in pMCI. Serum valine significantly predicted 
conversion from MCI to AD. In addition, serum valine was related to the rate of 
change of cerebral glucose metabolism during the follow-up period in pMCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum valine may be a peripheral biomarker of pMCI and AD, and its 
level predicts the progression of MCI to AD. Our study may help to reveal the 
metabolic changes during AD disease trajectory and its relationship to clinical 
phenotype.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of 
vendor-provided atlas-based MRAC on FDG PET/MR for the evaluation of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) by using simulated images.
METHODS: We recruited 47 patients, from two institutions, who underwent PET/CT 
and PET/MR (GE SIGNA) examination for oncological staging. From the PET raw data 
acquired on PET/MR, two FDG-PET series were generated, using vendor-provided 
MRAC (atlas-based) and CTAC. The following simulation steps were performed in 
MNI space: After spatial normalization and smoothing of the PET datasets, we 
calculated the error map for each patient, PETMRAC/PETCTAC. We multiplied each 
of these 47 error maps with each of the 203 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cases after the identical normalization and smoothing. This 
resulted in 203*47 = 9541 datasets. To evaluate the probability of AD in each 
resulting image, a cumulative t-value was calculated automatically using 
commercially-available software (PMOD PALZ) which has been used in multiple 
large cohort studies. The diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of AD and 
predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD were evaluated 
in simulated images compared with ADNI original images.
RESULTS: The accuracy and specificity for the discrimination of AD-patients from 
normal controls were not substantially impaired, but sensitivity was slightly 
impaired in 5 out of 47 datasets (original vs. error; 83.2% [CI 75.0%-89.0%], 
83.3% [CI 74.2%-89.8%] and 83.1% [CI 75.6%-88.3%] vs. 82.7% [range 80.4-85.0%], 
78.5% [range 72.9-83.3%,] and 86.1% [range 81.4-89.8%]). The accuracy, 
sensitivity and specificity for predicting progression from MCI to AD during 
2-year follow-up was not impaired (original vs. error; 62.5% [CI 53.3%-69.3%], 
78.8% [CI 65.4%-88.6%] and 54.0% [CI 47.0%-69.1%] vs. 64.8% [range 61.5-66.7%], 
75.7% [range 66.7-81.8%,] and 59.0% [range 50.8-63.5%]). The worst 3 error maps 
show a tendency towards underestimation of PET scores.
CONCLUSION: FDG-PET/MR based on atlas-based MR attenuation correction showed 
similar diagnostic accuracy to the CT-based method for the diagnosis of AD and 
the prediction of progression of MCI to AD using commercially-available 
software, although with a minor reduction in sensitivity.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of Ab and tau, Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) 
imaging and hippocampal atrophy are promising Alzheimer's disease biomarkers yet 
the associations between them are not known. We applied a validated, automated 
hippocampal labeling method and 3D radial distance mapping to the 1.5T 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 388 ADNI subjects with 
baseline CSF Ab(42), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau(181)) and 
98 subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using PIB. We used 
linear regression to investigate associations between hippocampal atrophy and 
average cortical, parietal and precuneal PIB standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR) and CSF Ab(42), t-tau, p-tau(181), t-tau/Ab(42) and p-tau(181)/Ab(42). 
All CSF measures showed significant associations with hippocampal volume and 
radial distance in the pooled sample. Strongest correlations were seen for 
p-tau(181), followed by p-tau(181)/Ab(42) ratio, t-tau/Ab(42) ratio, t-tau and 
Ab(42). p-tau(181) showed stronger correlation in ApoE4 carriers, while t-tau 
showed stronger correlation in ApoE4 noncarriers. Of the 3 PIB measures the 
precuneal SUVR showed strongest associations with hippocampal atrophy.

OBJECTIVE: It remains unclear if and how the interactions between APOE genotypes 
and cerebral small-vessel diseases (CSVD) lead to cognitive decline in the long 
term. Based on ADNI cohort, this longitudinal study aimed to clarify the 
potential relationship among APOE genotype, CSVD and cognition by integrating 
multi-level data.
METHOD: There were 135 healthy elderly (including ε2, ε4 allele carriers and ε3 
homozygotes) who had completed two years' follow-up. MRI markers of CSVD, 
including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), dilated perivascular space 
(dPVS), microbleeds and lacune, were assessed. Besides, neuropathological 
factors including Alzheimer's disease-related pathology measured by CSF and 
PiB-PET were assessed. Repeated measurements ANOVAs were performed to test 
impact of different APOE genotypes on CSVD.
RESULTS: We found that APOE ε4 carriers had significantly more frontal WMH 
burden and basal ganglia dPVS at baseline and faster progression of frontal WMH 
burden during follow-up. Furthermore, our results showed that APOE ε4 carriers 
had significantly decreased Aβ1-42 level, and its level was negatively related 
with baseline and progressive total WMH burden. Then, general linear modals 
indicated interaction between basal frontal WMH burden and ε4 allele was related 
with declining trend of cognition.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested APOE ε4 allele was associated with increased 
Aβ deposition, which may lead to the formation and progression of WMH, 
especially in frontal lobe. Besides, interaction between the increased frontal 
WMH burden and ε4 allele can exert long-term detrimental effects on individual's 
trajectory of cognition.

The underlying genetic susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not yet 
fully understood. The heterogeneous nature of the disease challenges genetic 
association studies. Endophenotype approaches can help to address this challenge 
by more direct interrogation of biological traits related to the disease. AD 
endophenotypes based on amyloid-β, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers 
and cognitive performance were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 1565). A genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) of quantitative phenotypes was performed using an SNP main effect 
and an SNP by Diagnosis interaction (SNP × DX) model to identify disease 
stage-specific genetic effects. Nine loci were identified as study-wide 
significant with one or more A/T/N endophenotypes in the main effect model, as 
well as additional findings significantly associated with cognitive measures. 
These nine loci include SNPs in or near the genes APOE, SRSF10, HLA-DQB1, XKR3, 
and KIAA1671. The SNP × DX model identified three study-wide significant genetic 
loci (BACH2, EP300, and PACRG-AS1) with a neuroprotective effect in later AD 
stage endophenotypes. An endophenotype approach identified novel genetic 
associations and provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
genetic associations that may otherwise be missed using conventional 
case-control study designs.

18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) allows early 
identification of neurodegeneration in dementia. The use of an optimized method 
based on the SPM software package highly improves diagnostic accuracy. However, 
the impact of different scanners for data acquisition on the SPM results and the 
effects of different pools of healthy subjects on the statistical comparison 
have not been investigated yet. Images from 144 AD patients acquired using six 
different PET scanners were analysed with an optimized single-subject SPM 
procedure to identify the typical AD hypometabolism pattern at single subject 
level. We compared between-scanners differences on the SPM outcomes in a 
factorial design. Single-subject SPM comparison analyses were also performed 
against a different group of healthy controls from the ADNI initiative. The 
concordance between the two analyses (112 vs. 157 control subjects) was tested 
using Dice scores. In addition, we applied the optimized single-subject SPM 
procedure to the FDG-PET data acquired with 3 different scanners in 57 MCI 
subjects, in order to assess for tomograph influence in early disease phase. All 
the patients showed comparable AD-like hypometabolic patterns, also in the 
prodromal phase, in spite of being acquired with different PET scanners. SPM 
statistical comparisons performed with the two different healthy control 
databases showed a high degree of concordance (76% average pattern volume 
overlap and 90% voxel-wise agreement in AD-related brain structures). The 
validated optimized SPM-based single-subject procedure is influenced neither by 
the scanners used for image acquisition, nor by differences in healthy control 
groups, thus implying a great reliability of this method for longitudinal and 
multicentre studies.

INTRODUCTION: Alterations in locus coeruleus' (LC) metabolic turnover are 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-pathology and cognitive impairment. 
However, the evolution of these changes across disease stages and their 
functional relevance remains unknown.
METHODS: We examined associations of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) -derived LC metabolism with clinical diagnostic status, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -based AD biomarkers of AD pathology, and cognitive 
decline in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants 
(n = 604).
RESULTS: FDG-PET-derived LC metabolism was elevated in the earliest preclinical 
stages and lower in later disease stages. Higher LC metabolism was associated 
with attenuated memory decline in preclinical stages, particularly in those with 
low CSF Aβ42, but not in AD patients with cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Higher locus coeruleus [18F]-FDG-PET-derived signal in the early 
preclinical stages of AD can confer cognitive resilience and may reflect 
increased metabolic activity, whereas later stages are characterized by lower LC 
FDG-PET-derived signal, possibly due to neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: LC FDG-PET signal is lower in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. LC 
FDG-PET signal is higher in the preclinical stage of AD. We observed less memory 
decline in those with higher LC FDG-PET signal. Higher LC FDG-PET signal 
conferred cognitive resilience in preclinical AD.

Previous studies have demonstrated resilience to AD-related neuropathology in a 
form of cognitive reserve (CR). In this study we investigated a relationship 
between CR and hypometabolic subtypes of AD, specifically the typical and the 
limbic-predominant subtypes. We analyzed data from 59 Aβ-positive cognitively 
normal (CN), 221 prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 174 AD dementia 
participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from 
ADNI and ADNIGO/2 phases. For replication, we analyzed data from 5 Aβ-positive 
CN, 89 prodromal AD and 43 AD dementia participants from ADNI3. CR was estimated 
as standardized residuals in a model predicting cognition from temporoparietal 
grey matter volumes and covariates. Higher CR estimates predicted slower 
cognitive decline. Typical and limbic-predominant hypometabolic subtypes 
demonstrated similar baseline CR, but the results suggested a faster decline of 
CR in the typical subtype. These findings support the relationship between 
subtypes and CR, specifically longitudinal trajectories of CR. Results also 
underline the importance of longitudinal analyses in research on CR.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the 
development of AD is irreversible. However, preventive measures in the 
presymptomatic stage of AD can effectively slow down deterioration. 
Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can detect the 
metabolism of glucose in patients' brains, which can help to identify changes 
related to AD before brain damage occurs. Machine learning is useful for early 
diagnosis of patients with AD using FDG-PET, but it requires a sufficiently 
large dataset, and it is easy for overfitting to occur in small datasets. 
Previous studies using machine learning for early diagnosis with FDG-PET have 
either involved the extraction of elaborately handcrafted features or validation 
on a small dataset, and few studies have explored the refined classification of 
early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and late mild cognitive impairment 
(LMCI). This article presents a broad network-based model for early diagnosis of 
AD (BLADNet) through PET imaging of the brain; this method employs a novel broad 
neural network to enhance the features of FDG-PET extracted via 2D CNN. BLADNet 
can search for information over a broad space through the addition of new BLS 
blocks without retraining of the whole network, thus improving the accuracy of 
AD classification. Experiments conducted on a dataset containing 2,298 FDG-PET 
images of 1,045 subjects from the ADNI database demonstrate that our methods are 
superior to those used in previous studies on early diagnosis of AD with 
FDG-PET. In particular, our methods achieved state-of-the-art results in EMCI 
and LMCI classification with FDG-PET.

The interconnected quality of brain regions in neurological disease has immense 
importance for the development of biomarkers and diagnostics. While Graph 
Convolutional Network (GCN) methods are fundamentally compatible with 
discovering the connected role of brain regions in disease, current methods 
apply limited consideration for node features and their connectivity in brain 
network analysis. In this paper, we propose a sparse interpretable GCN framework 
(SGCN) for the identification and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
using brain imaging data with multiple modalities. SGCN applies an attention 
mechanism with sparsity to identify the most discriminative subgraph structure 
and important node features for the detection of AD. The model learns the sparse 
importance probabilities for each node feature and edge with entropy, ℓ 1, and 
mutual information regularization. We then utilized this information to find 
signature regions of interest (ROIs), and emphasize the disease-specific brain 
network connections by detecting the significant difference of connectives 
between regions in healthy control (HC), and AD groups. We evaluated SGCN on the 
ADNI database with imaging data from three modalities, including VBM-MRI, 
FDG-PET, and AV45-PET, and observed that the important probabilities it learned 
are effective for disease status identification and the sparse interpretability 
of disease-specific ROI features and connections. The salient ROIs detected and 
the most discriminative network connections interpreted by our method show a 
high correspondence with previous neuroimaging evidence associated with AD.

Objective.to develop an optimization and training pipeline for a classification 
model based on principal component analysis and logistic regression using 
neuroimages from PET with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG PET) for the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Approach.as training data, 200 FDG PET 
neuroimages were used, 100 from the group of patients with AD and 100 from the 
group of cognitively normal subjects (CN), downloaded from the repository of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Regularization methods L1 
and L2 were tested and their respective strength varied by the hyperparameter C. 
Once the best combination of hyperparameters was determined, it was used to 
train the final classification model, which was then applied to test data, 
consisting of 192 FDG PET neuroimages, 100 from subjects with no evidence of AD 
(nAD) and 92 from the AD group, obtained at the Centro de Diagnóstico por Imagem 
(CDI).Main results.the best combination of hyperparameters was L1 regularization 
andC≈ 0.316. The final results on test data were accuracy = 88.54%, recall = 
90.22%, precision = 86.46% and AUC = 94.75%, indicating that there was a good 
generalization to neuroimages outside the training set. Adjusting each principal 
component by its respective weight, an interpretable image was obtained that 
represents the regions of greater or lesser probability for AD given high voxel 
intensities. The resulting image matches what is expected by the pathophysiology 
of AD.Significance.our classification model was trained on publicly available 
and robust data and tested, with good results, on clinical routine data. Our 
study shows that it serves as a powerful and interpretable tool capable of 
assisting in the diagnosis of AD in the possession of FDG PET neuroimages. The 
relationship between classification model output scores and AD progression can 
and should be explored in future studies.

Machine learning methods have successfully been used to predict the conversion 
of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD), by classifying 
MCI converters (MCI-C) from MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC). However, most existing 
methods construct classifiers using data from one particular target domain 
(e.g., MCI), and ignore data in other related domains (e.g., AD and normal 
control (NC)) that may provide valuable information to improve MCI conversion 
prediction performance. To address is limitation, we develop a novel domain 
transfer learning method for MCI conversion prediction, which can use data from 
both the target domain (i.e., MCI) and auxiliary domains (i.e., AD and NC). 
Specifically, the proposed method consists of three key components: 1) a domain 
transfer feature selection component that selects the most informative 
feature-subset from both target domain and auxiliary domains from different 
imaging modalities; 2) a domain transfer sample selection component that selects 
the most informative sample-subset from the same target and auxiliary domains 
from different data modalities; and 3) a domain transfer support vector machine 
classification component that fuses the selected features and samples to 
separate MCI-C and MCI-NC patients. We evaluate our method on 202 subjects from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that have MRI, FDG-PET, 
and CSF data. The experimental results show the proposed method can classify 
MCI-C patients from MCI-NC patients with an accuracy of 79.4%, with the aid of 
additional domain knowledge learned from AD and NC.

Improving Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis With Multi-Modal PET Embedding Features 
by a 3D Multi-Task MLP-Mixer Neural Network.

Zhang ZC, Zhao X, Dong G, Zhao XM.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or florbetapir 
(AV45) has been proved effective in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 
However, the expensive and radioactive nature of PET has limited its 
application. Here, employing multi-layer perceptron mixer architecture, we 
present a deep learning model, namely 3-dimensional multi-task multi-layer 
perceptron mixer, for simultaneously predicting the standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVRs) for FDG-PET and AV45-PET from the cheap and widely used 
structural magnetic resonance imaging data, and the model can be further used 
for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on embedding features derived from SUVR 
prediction. Experiment results demonstrate the high prediction accuracy of the 
proposed method for FDG/AV45-PET SUVRs, where we achieved Pearson's correlation 
coefficients of 0.66 and 0.61 respectively between the estimated and actual SUVR 
and the estimated SUVRs also show high sensitivity and distinct longitudinal 
patterns for different disease status. By taking into account PET embedding 
features, the proposed method outperforms other competing methods on five 
independent datasets in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and discriminating 
between stable and progressive mild cognitive impairments, achieving the area 
under receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.968 and 0.776 respectively 
on ADNI dataset, and generalizes better to other external datasets. Moreover, 
the top-weighted patches extracted from the trained model involve important 
brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting good biological 
interpretability of our proposed method."

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measures the decline 
in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, offering a reliable 
metabolic biomarker even on presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. 
PET scans provide functional information that is unique and unavailable using 
other types of imaging. However, the computational efficacy of FDG-PET data 
alone, for the classification of various Alzheimers Diagnostic categories, has 
not been well studied. This motivates us to correctly discriminate various AD 
Diagnostic categories using FDG-PET data. Deep learning has improved 
state-of-the-art classification accuracies in the areas of speech, signal, 
image, video, text mining and recognition. We propose novel methods that involve 
probabilistic principal component analysis on max-pooled data and mean-pooled 
data for dimensionality reduction, and multilayer feed forward neural network 
which performs binary classification. Our experimental dataset consists of 
baseline data of subjects including 186 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subects, 336 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with 158 Late MCI and 178 Early MCI, 
and 146 AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset. We measured F1-measure, precision, recall, negative and positive 
predictive values with a 10-fold cross validation scheme. Our results indicate 
that our designed classifiers achieve competitive results while max pooling 
achieves better classification performance compared to mean-pooled features. Our 
deep model based research may advance FDG-PET analysis by demonstrating their 
potential as an effective imaging biomarker of AD.

OBJECTIVES: The ATN's different modalities (fluids and neuroimaging) for each of 
the Aβ (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) elements are used for the 
biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aim to identify which ATN 
category achieves the highest potential for diagnosis and predictive accuracy of 
longitudinal cognitive decline.
METHODS: Based on the availability of plasma ATN biomarkers (plasma-derived 
Aβ42/40 , p-tau181, NFL, respectively), CSF ATN biomarkers (CSF-derived Aβ42 
/Aβ40 , p-tau181, NFL), and neuroimaging ATN biomarkers (18F-florbetapir (FBP) 
amyloid-PET, 18F-flortaucipir (FTP) tau-PET, and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET), 
a total of 2340 participants were selected from ADNI.
RESULTS: Our data analysis indicates that the area under curves (AUCs) of CSF-A, 
neuroimaging-T, and neuroimaging-N were ranked the top three ATN candidates for 
accurate diagnosis of AD. Moreover, neuroimaging ATN biomarkers display the best 
predictive ability for longitudinal cognitive decline among the three 
categories. To note, neuroimaging-T correlates well with cognitive performances 
in a negative correlation manner. Meanwhile, participants in the "N" element 
positive group, especially the CSF-N positive group, experience the fastest 
cognitive decline compared with other groups defined by ATN biomarkers. In 
addition, the voxel-wise analysis showed that CSF-A related to tau accumulation 
and FDG-PET indexes more strongly in subjects with MCI stage. According to our 
analysis of the data, the best three ATN candidates for a precise diagnosis of 
AD are CSF-A, neuroimaging-T, and neuroimaging-N.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings suggest that plasma, CSF, and 
neuroimaging biomarkers differ considerably within the ATN framework; the most 
accurate target biomarkers for diagnosing AD were the CSF-A, neuroimaging-T, and 
neuroimaging-N within each ATN modality. Moreover, neuroimaging-T and CSF-N both 
show excellent ability in the prediction of cognitive decline in two different 
dimensions.

Disentangling biologically distinct subgroups of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may 
facilitate a deeper understanding of the neurobiology underlying clinical 
heterogeneity. We employed longitudinal [18F]FDG-PET standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVRs) to map hypometabolism across cognitively-defined AD subgroups. 
Participants were 384 amyloid-positive individuals with an AD dementia diagnosis 
from ADNI who had a total of 1028 FDG-scans (mean time between first and last 
scan: 1.6 ± 1.8 years). These participants were categorized into subgroups on 
the basis of substantial impairment at time of dementia diagnosis in a specific 
cognitive domain relative to the average across domains. This approach resulted 
in groups of AD-Memory (n = 135), AD-Executive (n = 8), AD-Language (n = 22), 
AD-Visuospatial (n = 44), AD-Multiple Domains (n = 15) and AD-No Domains (for 
whom no domain showed substantial relative impairment; n = 160). Voxelwise 
contrasts against controls revealed that all AD-subgroups showed progressive 
hypometabolism compared to controls across temporoparietal regions at time of AD 
diagnosis. Voxelwise and regions-of-interest (ROI)-based linear mixed model 
analyses revealed there were also subgroup-specific hypometabolism patterns and 
trajectories. The AD-Memory group had more pronounced hypometabolism compared to 
all other groups in the medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate, and faster 
decline in metabolism in the medial temporal lobe compared to AD-Visuospatial. 
The AD-Language group had pronounced lateral temporal hypometabolism compared to 
all other groups, and the pattern of metabolism was also more asymmetrical 
(left < right) than all other groups. The AD-Visuospatial group had faster 
decline in metabolism in parietal regions compared to all other groups, as well 
as faster decline in the precuneus compared to AD-Memory and AD-No Domains. 
Taken together, in addition to a common pattern, cognitively-defined subgroups 
of people with AD dementia show subgroup-specific hypometabolism patterns, as 
well as differences in trajectories of metabolism over time. These findings 
provide support to the notion that cognitively-defined subgroups are 
biologically distinct.

Dementia is broadly characterized by cognitive and psychological dysfunction 
that significantly impairs daily functioning. Dementia has many causes including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration (FTLD). Detection and differential diagnosis in the early 
stages of dementia remains challenging. Fueled by AD Neuroimaging Initiatives 
(ADNI) (Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. As such, the 
investigators within ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI 
and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this 
report.), a number of neuroimaging biomarkers for AD have been proposed, yet it 
remains to be seen whether these markers are also sensitive to other types of 
dementia. We assessed AD-related metabolic patterns in 27 patients with diverse 
forms of dementia (five had probable/possible AD while others had atypical 
cases) and 20 non-demented individuals. All participants had positron emission 
tomography (PET) scans on file. We used a pre-trained machine learning-based AD 
designation (MAD) framework to investigate the AD-related metabolic pattern 
among the participants under study. The MAD algorithm showed a sensitivity of 
0.67 and specificity of 0.90 for distinguishing dementia patients from 
non-dementia participants. A total of 18/27 dementia patients and 2/20 
non-dementia patients were identified as having AD-like patterns of metabolism. 
These results highlight that many underlying causes of dementia have similar 
hypometabolic pattern as AD and this similarity is an interesting avenue for 
future research.

INTRODUCTION: The adipokines leptin and adiponectin have been associated with 
atherosclerosis and the risk of cerebral infarcts. Pre-clinical studies, 
however, suggest a protective role against ischemic brain damage. In this study 
we analyzed the relationship between serum leptin and adiponectin levels and the 
onset or progression of brain infarcts in subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: All data were extracted from the ADNI database. The final population 
included 566 subjects, with 58 healthy controls, 396 MCI and 112 AD. All 
patients with available serum leptin and adiponectin levels at baseline were 
selected. Demographics, neuropsychological test results, CSF biomarkers, 
regional brain metabolism with FDG-PET data and the number of brain infarcts on 
longitudinal MRI scans were extracted.
RESULTS: Leptin levels were significantly lower in patients with MCI than 
controls at baseline, while adiponectin levels were not different between the 
groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis at baseline for the presence 
of brain infarcts showed a predictive value for leptin but not for adiponectin. 
Multivariate longitudinal analysis showed that age was the only significant 
predictor of brain infarcts development at 15-year follow-up, while serum leptin 
and adiponectin levels did not play a role in this population.
DISCUSSION: The evidence on the pathogenetic or protective role of adipokines on 
ischemic brain damage is mixed. In this MCI and AD population, serum leptin and 
adiponectin were not associated with the development of brain infarcts; 
therefore, these results do not support the use of adipokines as biomarkers of 
cerebrovascular pathology in this population.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a complex signaling protein that 
supports vascular and neuronal function. Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
-neuropathological hallmarks interfere with VEGF signaling and modify previously 
detected positive associations between cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) VEGF and 
cognition and hippocampal volume. However, it remains unknown 1) whether 
regional relationships between VEGF and glucose metabolism and cortical thinning 
exist, and 2) whether AD-neuropathological hallmarks (CSF Aβ, t-tau, p-tau) also 
modify these relationships. We addressed this in 310 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (92 cognitively normal, 149 mild 
cognitive impairment, 69 AD; 215 CSF Aβ+, 95 CSF Aβ-) with regional cortical 
thickness and cognition measurements and 158 participants with FDG-PET. In 
Aβ + participants (CSF Aβ42 ≤ 192 pg/mL), higher CSF VEGF levels were associated 
with greater FDG-PET signal in the inferior parietal, and middle and inferior 
temporal cortices. Abnormal CSF amyloid and tau levels strengthened the positive 
association between VEGF and regional FDG-PET indices. VEGF also had both direct 
associations with semantic memory, as well as indirect associations mediated by 
regional FDG-PET signal to cognition.

PURPOSE: Brain 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose ([18F]FDG-PET) is widely used in the 
diagnostic workup of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current tools for uptake analysis 
rely on non-personalized templates, which poses a challenge as decreased glucose 
uptake could reflect neuronal dysfunction, or heterogeneous brain morphology 
associated with normal aging. Overcoming this, we propose a deep learning method 
for synthesizing a personalized [18F]FDG-PET baseline from the patient's own 
MRI, and showcase its applicability in detecting AD pathology.
METHODS: We included [18F]FDG-PET/MRI data from 123 patients of a local cohort 
and 600 patients from ADNI. A supervised, adversarial model with two connected 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) was trained on cognitive normal (CN) 
patients with transfer-learning to generate full synthetic baseline volumes 
(sbPET) (192 × 192 × 192) which reflect healthy uptake conditioned on brain 
anatomy. Synthetic accuracy was measured by absolute relative %-difference 
(Abs%), relative %-difference (RD%), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). 
Lastly, we deployed the sbPET images in a fully personalized method for 
localizing metabolic abnormalities.
RESULTS: The model achieved a spatially uniform Abs% of 9.4%, RD% of 0.5%, and a 
PSNR of 26.3 for CN subjects. The sbPET images conformed to the anatomical 
information dictated by the MRI and proved robust in presence of atrophy. The 
personalized abnormality method correctly mapped the pathology of AD subjects 
while showing little to no anomalies for CN subjects.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing fully 
personalized, healthy-appearing [18F]FDG-PET images. Using these, we showcased a 
promising application in diagnosing AD, and theorized the potential value of 
sbPET images in other neuroimaging routines.

BACKGROUND: Quantitative evaluation of amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET) with standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) plays a key role in clinical 
studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed a PET-only (MR-free) 
amyloid quantification method, although some commercial software packages are 
required. The aim of this study was to develop an automated quantification tool 
for amyloid PET without using commercial software.
METHODS: The quantification tool was created by combining four components: (1) 
anatomical standardization to positive and negative templates using NEUROSTAT 
stereo.exe; (2) similarity calculation between standardized images and 
respective templates based on normalized cross-correlation (selection of the 
image for SUVR measurement); (3) voxel value normalization by the mean value of 
reference regions (making an SUVR-scaled image); and (4) SUVR calculation based 
on pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs). We examined 166 subjects who 
underwent a [11C] Pittsburgh compound-B PET scan through the Japanese 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) study. SUVRs in five ROIs 
(frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and posterior 
cingulate cortex and precuneus) were calculated with the cerebellar cortex as 
the reference region. The SUVRs obtained by our tool were compared with manual 
step-by-step processing and the conventional PMOD-based method (PMOD 
Technologies, Switzerland).
RESULTS: Compared with manual step-by-step processing, our developed automated 
quantification tool reduced processing time by 85%. The SUVRs obtained by the 
developed quantification tool were consistent with those obtained by manual 
processing. Compared with the conventional PMOD-based method, the developed 
quantification tool provided 1.5% lower SUVR values, on average. We determined 
that this bias is likely due to the difference in anatomical standardization 
methods.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an automated quantification tool for amyloid PET 
images. Using this tool, SUVR values can be quickly measured without individual 
MRI and without commercial software. This quantification tool may be useful for 
clinical studies of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Analyses of off-label use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
(AChEIs) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has produced mixed results. Post hoc 
analyses of observational cohorts, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI), have reported deleterious effects in AChEI-treated subjects 
(AChEI+). Here, we used neuroimaging biomarkers to determine whether AChEI+ 
subjects had a greater rate of neurodegeneration than untreated (AChEI-) 
subjects while accounting for baseline differences.
METHODS: We selected 121 ADNI MCI AChEI+ subjects and 151 AChEI- subjects with a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; 82 AChEI+ and 110 AChEI- also had a 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scan. A subset (83 AChEI+ and 98 AChEI-) had 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
assessment for amyloid positivity. Linear regression models were used to compare 
the effect of treatment on changes in Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical 
Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scores. We used standard regression in SPM (for 
baseline) and the SPM toolbox sandwich estimator, SwE (for longitudinal) for 
comparisons of AChEI+ and AChEI- FDG PET and MRI data.
RESULTS: At baseline, the AChEI+ group had significantly reduced cortical gray 
matter density (GMD) and more hypometabolism than AChEI- subjects. The greater 
rate of atrophy and hypometabolic changes over time in AChEI+ compared to AChEI- 
subjects did not survive correction for baseline differences. AChEI+ 
participants were more likely to be amyloid-positive and have lower GMD and FDG 
standardized uptake value ratio than AChEI- at baseline. AChEI+ subjects showed 
greater atrophy over time, which remained significant after controlling for 
amyloid status.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that the observed differences in rates of cognitive 
decline, atrophy, and hypometabolism are likely the result of significant 
baseline differences between the groups. Furthermore, the data indicate no 
treatment effect of AChEI (positive of negative), rather that physicians 
prescribe AChEI to subjects who present with more severe clinical impairment. 
This alone may account for the negative effect seen previously in the ADNI 
population of AChEI use among MCI subjects.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater variability of the 
visual interpretation of 11C-PiB PET images regarding the positivity/negativity 
of amyloid deposition that were obtained in a multicenter clinical research 
project, Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). The 
results of visual interpretation were also compared with a semi-automatic 
quantitative analysis using mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio to the 
cerebellar cortex (mcSUVR).
METHODS: A total of 162 11C-PiB PET scans, including 45 mild Alzheimer's 
disease, 60 mild cognitive impairment, and 57 normal cognitive control cases 
that had been acquired as J-ADNI baseline scans were analyzed. Based on visual 
interpretation by three independent raters followed by consensus read, each case 
was classified into positive, equivocal, and negative deposition (ternary 
criteria) and further dichotomized by merging the former two (binary criteria).
RESULTS: Complete agreement of visual interpretation by the three raters was 
observed for 91.3% of the cases (Cohen κ = 0.88 on average) in ternary criteria 
and for 92.3% (κ = 0.89) in binary criteria. Cases that were interpreted as 
visually positive in the consensus read showed significantly higher mcSUVR than 
those visually negative (2.21 ± 0.37 vs. 1.27 ± 0.09, p < 0.001), and positive 
or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off 
value of mcSUVR = 1.5. Significant positive/negative associations were observed 
between mcSUVR and the number of raters who evaluated as positive (ρ = 0.87, 
p < 0.0001) and negative (ρ = -0.85, p < 0.0001) interpretation. Cases of 
disagreement among raters showed generally low mcSUVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect in 11C-PiB PET scans. 
Positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a 
cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. As some cases of disagreement among raters tended 
to show low mcSUVR, referring to quantitative method may facilitate correct 
diagnosis when evaluating images of low amyloid deposition.

Background: National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 
proposed the AT(N) system based on β-amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and 
neurodegeneration, which considered the definition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
as a biological construct. However, the associations between different AT(N) 
combinations and cognitive progression have been poorly explored systematically. 
The aim of this study is to compare different AT(N) combinations using 
recognized biomarkers within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort. Methods: A total of 341 participants were classified into 
cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 200) and cognitively impaired (CI; n = 141) 
groups according to the clinical manifestations and neuropsychological tests. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and amyloid-PET ([18F]flutemetamol) were used as 
biomarkers for A; CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tau-PET ([18F]flortaucipir) 
were used as biomarkers for T; CSF total tau (t-tau), hippocampal volume, 
temporal cortical thickness, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and plasma 
neurofilament light (NfL) were used as biomarkers for (N). Binary biomarkers 
were obtained from the Youden index and publicly available cutoffs. Prevalence 
of AT(N) categories was compared between different biomarkers within the group 
using related independent sample non-parametric test. The relationship between 
AT(N) combinations and 12-year longitudinal cognition was assessed using linear 
mixed-effects modeling. Results: Among the CU participants, A-T-(N)- was most 
common. More T+ were detected using p-tau than tau PET (p < 0.05), and more (N)+ 
were observed using fluid biomarkers (p < 0.001). A+T+(N)+ was more common in 
the CI group. Tau PET combined with cortical thickness best predicted cognitive 
changes in the CI group and MRI predicted changes in the CU group. Conclusions: 
These findings suggest that optimal AT(N) combinations to determine longitudinal 
cognition differ by cognitive status. Different biomarkers within a specific 
component for defining AT(N) cannot be used identically. Furthermore, different 
strategies for discontinuous biomarkers will be an important area for future 
studies.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that amyloid-β (Aβ) burden influenced 
white matter (WM) integrity before the onset of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the effects of Aβ burden on WM integrity in 
cognitively normal (CN) individuals were regionally specific.
METHODS: Our cohort consisted of 71 CNs from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database who underwent both AV45 amyloid-PET and 
diffusion tensor imaging. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was computed 
across four bilateral regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to four stages of 
in vivo amyloid staging model (Amyloid stages I-IV). Linear regression models 
were conducted in entire CN group and between APOEɛ4 carriers and non-carriers.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that higher global Aβ-SUVR was associated with 
higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the entire CN group (p = 0.023), and with both 
higher MD (p = 0.015) and lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (p = 0.026) in APOEɛ4 
carriers. Subregion analysis showed that higher Amyloid stage I-II Aβ-SUVRs were 
associated with higher MD (Stage-1: p = 0.030; Stage-2: p = 0.016) in the entire 
CN group, and with both higher MD (Stage-1: p = 0.004; Stage-2: p = 0.010) and 
lower FA (Stage-1: p = 0.022; Stage-2: p = 0.014) in APOEɛ4 carriers. No 
associations were found in APOEɛ4 non-carriers and in Amyloid stage III-IV ROIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the effects of Aβ burden on WM integrity 
in CNs might be regionally specific, particularly in Amyloid stage I-II ROIs, 
and modulated by APOEɛ4 status.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain degenerative disorder 
affecting people aged older than 65 years. Currently, there is no effective cure 
for AD, but its progression can be delayed with some treatments. Accurate and 
early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future 
treatment. Fluorodeoxyglucose positrons emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a 
functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be powerful to help 
understand the anatomical and neural changes of brain related to AD. Most 
existing methods extract the handcrafted features from images, and then design a 
classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. These methods highly depends on 
the preprocessing of brain images, including image rigid registration and 
segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, 
this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which 
learns the intra-slice and inter-slice features for classification after 
decomposition of the 3D PET image into a sequence of 2D slices. The 2D CNNs are 
built to capture the features of image slices while the gated recurrent unit 
(GRU) of RNN is cascaded to learn and integrate the inter-slice features for 
image classification. No rigid registration and segmentation are required for 
PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline FDG-PET images acquired from 
339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 
100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 95.3% for AD vs. NC 
classification and 83.9% for MCI vs. NC classification, demonstrating the 
promising classification performance.

INTRODUCTION: Based on previous studies, a preclinical classification for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed. However, 1) specificity of the 
different neuronal injury (NI) biomarkers has not been studied, 2) subjects with 
subtle cognitive impairment but normal NI biomarkers (SCINIB) have not been 
included in the analyses and 3) progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
or dementia of the AD type (DAT), referred to here as MCI/DAT, varies between 
studies. Therefore, we analyzed data from 486 cognitively normal (CN) and 327 
DAT subjects in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1/GO/2 cohorts.
RESULTS: In the ADNI-1 cohort (median follow-up of 6 years), 6.3% and 17.0% of 
the CN subjects developed MCI/DAT after 3 and 5 years follow-up, respectively. 
NI biomarker cutoffs [structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) tau] were established in DAT patients and memory composite scores 
were calculated in CN subjects in a cross-sectional sample (n = 160). In the 
complete longitudinally followed CN ADNI cohort (n = 326, median follow-up of 
2 years), CSF and MRI values predicted an increased conversion to MCI/DAT. 
Different NI biomarkers showed important disagreements for classifying subjects 
as abnormal NI [kappa = (-0.05)-(0.33)] and into AD preclinical groups. SCINIB 
subjects (5.0%) were more prevalent than AD preclinical stage 3 subjects (3.4%) 
and showed a trend for increased progression to MCI/DAT.
CONCLUSIONS: Different NI biomarkers lead to different classifications of ADNI 
subjects, while structural MRI and CSF tau measures showed the strongest 
predictive value for progression to MCI/DAT. The newly defined SCINIB category 
of ADNI subjects is more prevalent than AD preclinical stage individuals.

Introduction: Unraveling the network pathobiology in neurodegenerative disorders 
is a popular and promising field in research. We use a relatively newer network 
measure of assortativity in metabolic connectivity to understand network 
differences in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), compared with those with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Eighty-three demographically matched 
patients with dementia (56 AD and 27 MCI) who underwent positron emission 
tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) study were recruited for this 
exploratory study. Global and nodal network measures obtained using the BRain 
Analysis using graPH theory toolbox were used to derive group-level differences 
(corrected p < 0.05). The methods were validated in age, and gender-matched 23 
cognitively normal, 25 MCI, and 53 AD patients from the publicly available 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Regions that revealed 
significant differences were correlated with the Addenbrooke's Cognitive 
Examination-III (ACE-III) scores. Results: Patients with AD revealed 
significantly increased global assortativity compared with the MCI group. In 
addition, they also revealed increased modularity and decreased participation 
coefficient. These findings were validated in the ADNI data. We also found that 
the regional standard uptake values of the right superior parietal and left 
superior temporal lobes were proportional to the ACE-III memory subdomain 
scores. Conclusion: Global errors associated with network assortativity are 
found in patients with AD, making the networks more regular and less resilient. 
Since the regional measures of these network errors were proportional to memory 
deficits, these measures could be useful in understanding the network 
pathobiology in AD.

AIM: Attenuation correction using zero-echo time (ZTE) - magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) (ZTE-MRAC) has become one of the standard methods for 
brain-positron emission tomography (PET) on commercial PET/MR scanners. Although 
the accuracy of the net tracer-uptake quantification based on ZTE-MRAC has been 
validated, that of the diagnosis for dementia has not yet been clarified, 
especially in terms of automated statistical analysis. The aim of this study was 
to clarify the impact of ZTE-MRAC on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
by performing simulation study.
METHODS: We recruited 27 subjects, who underwent both PET/computed tomography 
(CT) and PET/MR (GE SIGNA) examinations. Additionally, we extracted 107 subjects 
from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. From the PET 
raw data acquired on PET/MR, three FDG-PET series were generated, using two 
vendor-provided MRAC methods (ZTE and Atlas) and CT-based AC. Following spatial 
normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, we calculated each 
patient's specific error maps, which correspond to the difference between the 
PET image corrected using the CTAC method and the PET images corrected using the 
MRAC methods. To simulate PET maps as if ADNI data had been corrected using MRAC 
methods, we multiplied each of these 27 error maps with each of the 107 ADNI 
cases in MNI space. To evaluate the probability of AD in each resulting image, 
we calculated a cumulative t-value using a fully automated method which had been 
validated not only in the original ADNI dataset but several multi-center 
studies. In the method, PET score = 1 is the 95% prediction limit of AD. PET 
score and diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of AD were evaluated in 
simulated images using the original ADNI dataset as reference.
RESULTS: Positron emission tomography score was slightly underestimated both in 
ZTE and Atlas group compared with reference CTAC (-0.0796 ± 0.0938 vs. -0.0784 ± 
0.1724). The absolute error of PET score was lower in ZTE than Atlas group 
(0.098 ± 0.075 vs. 0.145 ± 0.122, p < 0.001). A higher correlation to the 
original PET score was observed in ZTE vs. Atlas group (R 2: 0.982 vs. 0.961). 
The accuracy for the discrimination of AD patients from normal control was 
maintained in ZTE and Atlas compared to CTAC (ZTE vs. Atlas. vs. original; 82.5% 
vs. 82.1% vs. 83.2% (CI 81.8-84.5%), respectively).
CONCLUSION: For FDG-PET images on PET/MR, attenuation correction using ZTE-MRI 
had superior accuracy to an atlas-based method in classification for dementia. 
ZTE maintains the diagnostic accuracy for AD.

A large number of papers have introduced novel machine learning and feature 
extraction methods for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, while the vast majority of these works use the public dataset ADNI for 
evaluation, they are difficult to reproduce because different key components of 
the validation are often not readily available. These components include 
selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross-validation 
procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to 
compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part 
of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification 
algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we 
propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in 
AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework 
comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format 
(BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and 
classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a 
baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of 
the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and 
FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the influence of different 
modalities, preprocessing, feature types (regional or voxel-based features), 
classifiers, training set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the 
state-of-the-art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks. No 
difference in performance was found for the use of different atlases, image 
smoothing, partial volume correction of FDG PET images, or feature type. Linear 
SVM and L2-logistic regression resulted in similar performance and both 
outperformed random forests. The classification performance increased along with 
the number of subjects used for training. Classifiers trained on ADNI 
generalized well to AIBL and OASIS. All the code of the framework and the 
experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated 
into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is 
available at: https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, the most common cause 
of dementia, so the accurate diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) is significant. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information 
for diagnosis. Many existing multi-modal models based on deep learning simply 
concatenate each modality's features despite substantial differences in 
representation spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal 
cross-attention AD diagnosis (MCAD) framework to learn the interaction between 
modalities for better playing their complementary roles for AD diagnosis with 
multi-modal data including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), 
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Specifically, the imaging and non-imaging 
representations are learned by the image encoder based on cascaded dilated 
convolutions and CSF encoder, respectively. Then, a multi-modal interaction 
module is introduced, which takes advantage of cross-modal attention to 
integrate imaging and non-imaging information and reinforce relationships 
between these modalities. Moreover, an extensive objective function is designed 
to reduce the discrepancy between modalities for effectively fusing the features 
of multi-modal data, which could further improve the diagnosis performance. We 
evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the ADNI dataset, and the 
extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCAD achieves superior performance 
for multiple AD-related classification tasks, compared to several competing 
methods. Also, we investigate the importance of cross-attention and the 
contribution of each modality to the diagnostics performance. The experimental 
results demonstrate that combining multi-modality data via cross-attention is 
helpful for accurate AD diagnosis.

For patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the likelihood of progression 
to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important not only for individual 
patient care, but also for the identification of participants in clinical trial, 
so as to provide early interventions. Biomarkers based on various neuroimaging 
modalities could offer complementary information regarding different aspects of 
disease progression. The current study adopted a weighted multi-modality sparse 
representation-based classification method to combine data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, from three imaging modalities: 
Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
emission tomography (PET), and florbetapir PET. We included 117 normal controls 
(NC) and 110 MCI patients, 27 of whom progressed to AD within 36 months (pMCI), 
while the remaining 83 remained stable (sMCI) over the same time period. 
Modality-specific biomarkers were identified to distinguish MCI from NC and to 
predict pMCI among MCI. These included the hippocampus, amygdala, middle 
temporal and inferior temporal regions for MRI, the posterior cingulum, 
precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, amygdala, 
and putamen for florbetapir PET. Results indicated that FDG-PET may be a more 
effective modality in discriminating MCI from NC and in predicting pMCI than 
florbetapir PET and MRI. Combining modality-specific sensitive biomarkers from 
the three modalities boosted the discrimination accuracy of MCI from NC (76.7%) 
and the prediction accuracy of pMCI (82.5%) when compared with the best 
single-modality results (73.6% for MCI and 75.6% for pMCI with FDG-PET).

BACKGROUND: The hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) describes high amyloid deposition and hypometabolism at the mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) stage. However, it remains unknown whether brain amyloidosis 
and hypometabolism follow the same trajectories in MCI individuals. We used the 
concept of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) as defined by the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-Go in order to compare the biomarker 
profile between EMCI and LMCI.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the global and voxel-based neocortical amyloid burden and 
metabolism among individuals who are cognitively normal (CN), as well as those 
with EMCI, LMCI and mild AD.
METHODS: In the present study, 354 participants, including CN (n = 109), EMCI (n 
= 157), LMCI (n = 39) and AD (n = 49), were enrolled between September 2009 and 
November 2011 through ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. Brain amyloid load and metabolism were 
estimated using [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) PET, 
respectively. Uptake ratio images of [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]FDG were calculated 
by dividing the summed PET image by the median counts of the grey matter of the 
cerebellum and pons, respectively. Group differences of global [(18)F]AV45 and 
[(18)F]FDG were analyzed using ANOVA, while the voxel-based group differences 
were estimated using statistic parametric mapping (SPM).
RESULTS: EMCI patients showed higher global [(18)F]AV45 retention compared to CN 
and lower uptake compared to LMCI. SPM detected higher [(18)F]AV45 uptake in 
EMCI compared to CN in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, medial and dorsal 
lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. EMCI showed lower [(18)F]AV45 
retention than LMCI in the superior temporal, inferior parietal, as well as 
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. Regarding to the global 
[(18)F]FDG, EMCI patients showed no significant difference from CN and a higher 
uptake ratio compared to LMCI. At the voxel level, EMCI showed higher metabolism 
in precuneus, hippocampus, entorhinal and inferior parietal cortices, as 
compared to LMCI.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that brain metabolism remains normal 
despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation in EMCI. These results 
suggest a role for anti-amyloid interventions in EMCI aiming to delay or halt 
the deposition of amyloid and related metabolism impairment.

impairment (MCI) to AD.
METHODS: This multicentre study included 1962 subjects from two ethnically 
diverse, independent cohorts (a Caucasian cohort from ADNI and an Asian cohort 
merged from two hospitals in China). The IDLR model involved feature extraction, 
feature selection, and classification/prediction. We evaluated the IDLR model's 
ability to distinguish between subjects with different cognitive statuses and 
MCI trajectories (sMCI and pMCI) and compared results with radiomic and deep 
learning (DL) models. A Cox model tested the IDLR signature's predictive 
capability for MCI to AD progression. Correlation analyses identified critical 
IDLR features and verified their clinical diagnostic value.
RESULTS: The IDLR model achieved the best classification results for subjects 
with different cognitive statuses as well as in those with MCI with distinct 
trajectories, with an accuracy of 76.51% [72.88%, 79.60%], (95% confidence 
interval, CI) while those of radiomic and DL models were 69.13% [66.28%, 73.12%] 
and 73.89% [68.99%, 77.89%], respectively. According to the Cox model, the 
hazard ratio (HR) of the IDLR model was 1.465 (95% CI: 1.236-1.737, p < 0.001). 
Moreover, three crucial IDLR features were significantly different across 
cognitive stages and were significantly correlated with cognitive scale scores 
(p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results demonstrated that the IDLR model based on 
[18F]FDG PET images enhanced accuracy in diagnosing the clinical spectrum of AD.
KEY POINTS: Question The study addresses the lack of interpretability in 
existing DL classification models for diagnosing the AD spectrum. Findings The 
proposed interpretable DL radiomics model, using radiomics-supervised DL 
features, enhances interpretability from traditional DL models and improves 
classification accuracy. Clinical relevance The IDLR model interprets DL 
features through radiomics supervision, potentially advancing the application of 
DL in clinical classification tasks.

PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been proposed as a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the mechanisms underlying the putative 
association are poorly understood. We investigated elderly individuals with a 
remote history of TBI, aiming to understand how this may have influenced 
amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and clinical expression along the AD continuum.
METHODS: Total of 241 individual datasets including amyloid beta (Aβ) positron 
emission tomography ([18F]-AV45), structural MRI, and neuropsychological 
measures, were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 
The data were stratified into groups with (TBI +) or without (TBI -) history of 
head injury, and by clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, into subgroups with 
normal cognition (CDR = 0) and those with symptomatic cognitive decline 
(CDR ≥ 0.5). We contrasted the TBI + and TBI - subgroups with respect to the 
onset age and extent of cognitive decline, cortical thickness changes, and Aβ 
standard uptake value (SUVr).
RESULTS: Compared to the TBI -/CDR ≥ 0.5 subgroup, the TBI + /CDR ≥ 0.5 subgroup 
showed a 3-4 year earlier age of cognitive impairment onset (ACIO, p = 0.005). 
Among those participants on the AD continuum (Aβ + , as defined by a cortical 
SUVr ≥ 1.23), irrespective of current CDR, a TBI + history was associated with 
greater Aβ deposition and more pronounced cortical thinning. When matched for 
severity of cognitive status, the TBI + /CDR ≥ 0.5 group showed greater Aβ 
burden, but earlier ACIO as compared to the TBI -/CDR ≥ 0.5, suggesting a more 
indolent clinical AD progression in those with TBI history.
CONCLUSION: Remote TBI history may alter the AD onset trajectory, with 
approximately 4 years earlier ACIO, greater amyloid deposition, and cortical 
thinning.

Automated amyloid-PET image classification can support clinical assessment and 
increase diagnostic confidence. Three automated approaches using global 
cut-points derived from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, 
machine learning (ML) algorithms with regional SUVr values, and deep learning 
(DL) network with 3D image input were compared under various conditions: number 
of training data, radiotracers, and cohorts. 276 [11C]PiB and 209 [18F]AV45 PET 
images from ADNI database and our local cohort were used. Global mean and 
maximum SUVr cut-points were derived using ROC analysis. 68 ML models were built 
using regional SUVr values and one DL network was trained with classifications 
of two visual assessments - manufacturer's recommendations (gray-scale) and with 
visually guided reference region scaling (rainbow-scale). ML-based 
classification achieved similarly high accuracy as ROC classification, but had 
better convergence between training and unseen data, with a smaller number of 
training data. Naïve Bayes performed the best overall among the 68 ML 
algorithms. Classification with maximum SUVr cut-points yielded higher accuracy 
than with mean SUVr cut-points, particularly for cohorts showing more focal 
uptake. DL networks can support the classification of definite cases accurately 
but performed poorly for equivocal cases. Rainbow-scale standardized image 
intensity scaling and improved inter-rater agreement. Gray-scale detects focal 
accumulation better, thus classifying more amyloid-positive scans. All three 
approaches generally achieved higher accuracy when trained with rainbow-scale 
classification. ML yielded similarly high accuracy as ROC, but with better 
convergence between training and unseen data, and further work may lead to even 
more accurate ML methods.

Graphical, voxel, and region-based analysis has become a popular approach to 
studying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its 
prodromal stage [mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. These methods have been used 
previously for classification or discrimination of AD in subjects in a prodromal 
stage called stable MCI (MCIs), which does not convert to AD but remains stable 
over a period of time, and converting MCI (MCIc), which converts to AD, but the 
results reported across similar studies are often inconsistent. Furthermore, the 
classification accuracy for MCIs vs. MCIc is limited. In this study, we propose 
combining different neuroimaging modalities (sMRI, FDG-PET, AV45-PET, DTI, and 
rs-fMRI) with the apolipoprotein-E genotype to form a multimodal system for the 
discrimination of AD, and to increase the classification accuracy. Initially, we 
used two well-known analyses to extract features from each neuroimage for the 
discrimination of AD: whole-brain parcelation analysis (or region-based 
analysis), and voxel-wise analysis (or voxel-based morphometry). We also 
investigated graphical analysis (nodal and group) for all six binary 
classification groups (AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC 
vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs). Data for a total of 129 subjects (33 AD, 30 MCIs, 31 
MCIc, and 35 HCs) for each imaging modality were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage. These data also include two 
APOE genotype data points for the subjects. Moreover, we used the 2-mm AICHA 
atlas with the NiftyReg registration toolbox to extract 384 brain regions from 
each PET (FDG and AV45) and sMRI image. For the rs-fMRI images, we used the 
DPARSF toolbox in MATLAB for the automatic extraction of data and the results 
for REHO, ALFF, and fALFF. We also used the pyClusterROI script for the 
automatic parcelation of each rs-fMRI image into 200 brain regions. For the DTI 
images, we used the FSL (Version 6.0) toolbox for the extraction of fractional 
anisotropy (FA) images to calculate a tract-based spatial statistic. Moreover, 
we used the PANDA toolbox to obtain 50 white-matter-region-parcellated FA images 
on the basis of the 2-mm JHU-ICBM-labeled template atlas. To integrate the 
different modalities and different complementary information into one form, and 
to optimize the classifier, we used the multiple kernel learning (MKL) 
framework. The obtained results indicated that our multimodal approach yields a 
significant improvement in accuracy over any single modality alone. The areas 
under the curve obtained by the proposed method were 97.78, 96.94, 95.56, 96.25, 
96.67, and 96.59% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. 
MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs binary classification, respectively. Our proposed 
multimodal method improved the classification result for MCIs vs. MCIc groups 
compared with the unimodal classification results. Our study found that the 
(left/right) precentral region was present in all six binary classification 
groups (this region can be considered the most significant region). Furthermore, 
using nodal network topology, we found that FDG, AV45-PET, and rs-fMRI were the 
most important neuroimages, and showed many affected regions relative to other 
modalities. We also compared our results with recently published results.

18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) reveals altered 
brain metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some biomarkers derived from FDG-PET by 
computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) technologies have been proved that they can 
accurately diagnosis normal control (NC), MCI, and AD. However, existing 
FDG-PET-based researches are still insufficient for the identification of early 
MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI). Compared with methods based other modalities, 
current methods with FDG-PET are also inadequate in using the inter-region-based 
features for the diagnosis of early AD. Moreover, considering the variability in 
different individuals, some hard samples which are very similar with both two 
classes limit the classification performance. To tackle these problems, in this 
paper, we propose a novel bilinear pooling and metric learning network (BMNet), 
which can extract the inter-region representation features and distinguish hard 
samples by constructing the embedding space. To validate the proposed method, we 
collect 898 FDG-PET images from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI) including 263 normal control (NC) patients, 290 EMCI patients, 147 LMCI 
patients, and 198 AD patients. Following the common preprocessing steps, 90 
features are extracted from each FDG-PET image according to the automatic 
anatomical landmark (AAL) template and then sent into the proposed network. 
Extensive fivefold cross-validation experiments are performed for multiple 
two-class classifications. Experiments show that most metrics are improved after 
adding the bilinear pooling module and metric losses to the Baseline model 
respectively. Specifically, in the classification task between EMCI and LMCI, 
the specificity improves 6.38% after adding the triple metric loss, and the 
negative predictive value (NPV) improves 3.45% after using the bilinear pooling 
module. In addition, the accuracy of classification between EMCI and LMCI 
achieves 79.64% using imbalanced FDG-PET images, which illustrates that the 
proposed method yields a state-of-the-art result of the classification accuracy 
between EMCI and LMCI based on PET images.

We developed a novel quantification method named "shape feature" by combining 
the features of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and brain magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluated its significance in predicting the 
conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. From the ADNI 
database, 334 patients with MCI were included. The brain amyloid smoothing score 
(AV45_BASS) and brain atrophy index (MR_BAI) were calculated using the surface 
area and volume of the region of interest in AV45 PET and MRI. During the 
48-month follow-up period, 108 (32.3%) patients converted from MCI to AD. Age, 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), apolipoprotein E (APOE), standardized 
uptake value ratio (SUVR), AV45_BASS, MR_BAI, and shape feature were 
significantly different between converters and non-converters. Univariate 
analysis showed that age, MMSE, ADAS-cog, APOE, SUVR, AV45_BASS, MR_BAI, and 
shape feature were correlated with the conversion to AD. In multivariate 
analyses, high shape feature, SUVR, and ADAS-cog values were associated with an 
increased risk of conversion to AD. In patients with MCI in the ADNI cohort, our 
quantification method was the strongest prognostic factor for predicting their 
conversion to AD.

Background: In recent years, classification frameworks using imaging data have 
shown that multimodal classification methods perform favorably over the use of a 
single imaging modality for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. The currently 
used clinical approach often emphasizes the use of qualitative MRI and/or PET 
data for clinical diagnosis. Based on the hypothesis that classification of 
isolated imaging modalities is not predictive of their respective value in 
combined approaches, we investigate whether the combination of T1 Weighted MRI 
and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can yield an equivalent performance as the 
combination of quantitative structural MRI (sMRI) with amyloid-PET. Methods: We 
parcellated the brain into regions of interest (ROI) following different 
anatomical labeling atlases. For each region of interest different metrics were 
extracted from the different imaging modalities (sMRI, PiB-PET, and DTI) to be 
used as features. Thereafter, the feature sets were reduced using an 
embedded-based feature selection method. The final reduced sets were then used 
as input in support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Three different base 
classifiers were created, one for each imaging modality, and validated using 
internal (n = 41) and external data from the ADNI initiative (n = 330 for sMRI, 
n = 148 for DTI and n = 55 for PiB-PET) sources. Finally, the classifiers were 
ensembled using a weighted method in order to evaluate the performance of 
different combinations. Results: For the base classifiers the following 
performance levels were found: sMRI-based classifier (accuracy, 92%; 
specificity, 97% and sensitivity, 87%), PiB-PET (accuracy, 91%; specificity, 
89%; and sensitivity, 92%) and the lowest performance was attained with DTI 
(accuracy, 80%; specificity, 76%; and sensitivity, 82%). From the multimodal 
approaches, when integrating two modalities, the following results were 
observed: sMRI+PiB-PET (accuracy, 98%; specificity, 98%; and sensitivity, 99%), 
sMRI+DTI (accuracy, 97%; specificity, 99%; and sensitivity, 94%) and PiB-PET+DTI 
(accuracy, 91%; specificity, 90%; and sensitivity, 93%). Finally, the 
combination of all imaging modalities yielded an accuracy of 98%, specificity of 
97% and sensitivity of 99%. Conclusion: Although DTI in isolation shows 
relatively poor performance, when combined with structural MR, it showed a 
surprising classification performance which was comparable to MR combined with 
amyloid PET. These results are consistent with the notion that white matter 
changes are also important in Alzheimer's Disease.

The formation and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques are the earliest 
pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular imaging of Aβ 
plaques could serve as a surrogate marker in early diagnosis and 
neuropathogenesis studies of AD. Several radionuclide labeled ligands have 
recently been developed for noninvasive visualization of Aβ plaques in the 
brains of AD patients using single photon emission computed tomography or 
positron emission tomography (PET). There has been rapid progress in the field 
of imaging for plaque pathology. AV-45 was the first plaque imaging agent to 
enter multi-center, investigational new drug clinical trials in the US, and has 
now been studied in dozens of trials with more than 1,000 subjects ranging from 
cognitively normal individuals to those with AD dementia. "Imaging to autopsy" 
phase III studies further confirmed and validated the specific imaging signal 
correlated to the plaque burden in living subjects. With these promising and 
confirmed characteristics of AV-45, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) under common consensus decided on AV-45 as the emerging 
standard PET imaging agent for evaluating the progression of plaque pathology in 
patients with AD or mild cognition impairment, and even healthy controls. With 
the wide availability of AV-45 for plaque imaging, the ultimate goal of the ADNI 
is global clinical trials for disease detection and progression. This review 
presents recent experience with Aβ-targeting radiotracers at Chang Gung 
University and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is an imaging modality for diagnosing 
a number of neurological diseases. In contrast to Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI), PET is costly and involves injecting a radioactive substance into the 
patient. Motivated by developments in modality transfer in vision, we study the 
generation of certain types of PET images from MRI data. We derive new 
flow-based generative models which we show perform well in this small sample 
size regime (much smaller than dataset sizes available in standard vision 
tasks). Our formulation, DUAL-GLOW, is based on two invertible networks and a 
relation network that maps the latent spaces to each other. We discuss how given 
the prior distribution, learning the conditional distribution of PET given the 
MRI image reduces to obtaining the conditional distribution between the two 
latent codes w.r.t. the two image types. We also extend our framework to 
leverage "side" information (or attributes) when available. By controlling the 
PET generation through "conditioning" on age, our model is also able to capture 
brain FDG-PET (hypometabolism) changes, as a function of age. We present 
experiments on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset 
with 826 subjects, and obtain good performance in PET image synthesis, 
qualitatively and quantitatively better than recent works.

OBJECTIVES: 18F-FDG PET scan is one of the most frequently used neural imaging 
scans. However, the influence of age has proven to be the greatest interfering 
factor for many clinical dementia diagnoses when analyzing 18F-FDG PET images, 
since radiologists encounter difficulties when deciding whether the 
abnormalities in specific regions correlate with normal aging, disease, or both. 
In the present paper, the authors aimed to define specific brain regions and 
determine an age-correction mathematical model.
METHODS: A data-driven approach was used based on 255 healthy subjects.
RESULTS: The inferior frontal gyrus, the left medial part and the left medial 
orbital part of superior frontal gyrus, the right insula, the left anterior 
cingulate, the left median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri, and bilateral 
superior temporal gyri were found to have a strong negative correlation with 
age. For evaluation, an age-correction model was applied to 262 healthy subjects 
and 50 AD subjects selected from the ADNI database, and partial correlations 
between SUVR mean and three clinical results were carried out before and after 
age correction.
CONCLUSION: All correlation coefficients were significantly improved after the 
age correction. The proposed model was effective in the age correction of both 
healthy and AD subjects.

Deep learning methods using multimodal imagings have been proposed for the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stages (SMC, subjective 
memory complaints), which may help to slow the progression of the disease 
through early intervention. However, current fusion methods for multimodal 
imagings are generally coarse and may lead to suboptimal results through the use 
of shared extractors or simple downscaling stitching. Another issue with 
diagnosing brain diseases is that they often affect multiple areas of the brain, 
making it important to consider potential connections throughout the brain. 
However, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may struggle with this 
issue due to their limited local receptive fields. To address this, many 
researchers have turned to transformer networks, which can provide global 
information about the brain but can be computationally intensive and perform 
poorly on small datasets. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight network 
called MENet that adaptively recalibrates the multiscale long-range receptive 
field to localize discriminative brain regions in a computationally efficient 
manner. Based on this, the network extracts the intensity and location responses 
between structural magnetic resonance imagings (sMRI) and 
18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission computed Tomography (FDG-PET) as an 
enhancement fusion for AD and SMC diagnosis. Our method is evaluated on the 
publicly available ADNI datasets and achieves 97.67% accuracy in AD diagnosis 
tasks and 81.63% accuracy in SMC diagnosis tasks using sMRI and FDG-PET. These 
results achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both tasks. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is one of the first deep learning research methods for 
SMC diagnosis with FDG-PET.

Striatal changes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully 
understood yet. We compared structural and functional image differences in the 
striatum between patients with early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset AD (LOAD) to 
investigate whether EOAD harbors autosomal dominant AD like imaging findings. 
The clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging biomarkers of 77 probable AD 
patients and 107 elderly subjects with normal cognition (NC) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 dataset were analyzed. 
Enrolled each subject completed a 3-Tesla MRI, baseline 18F-FDG-PET, and 
baseline 18F-AV-45 (Florbetapir) amyloid PET studies. AD patients were divided 
into two groups based on the onset age of clinical symptoms (EOAD <65 yrs; LOAD 
≥65 yrs). A standardized uptake value ratio of the striatum and subcortical 
structures was obtained from both amyloid and FDG-PET scans. Structural MR 
imaging analysis was conducted using a parametric boundary description protocol, 
SPHARM-PDM. Of the 77 AD patients, 18 were EOAD and 59 were LOAD. Except for age 
of symptom onset, there were no statistically significant differences between 
the groups in demographics and detailed neuropsychological test results. 
18F-AV-45 amyloid PET showed marked β-amyloid accumulation in the bilateral 
caudate nucleus and left pallidum in the EOAD group. Intriguingly, the caudate 
nucleus and putamen showed maintained glucose metabolism in the EOAD group 
compared to the LOAD group. Our image findings in the striatum of EOAD patients 
suggest that sporadic EOAD may share some pathophysiological changes noted in 
autosomal dominant AD.

A multivariate analysis method, orthogonal partial least squares to latent 
structures (OPLS), was used to discriminate Alzheimer's disease (AD), early and 
late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI and LMCI) from cognitively normal control 
(CN) using MRI and PET measures. FreeSurfer 5.1 generated 271 MRI features 
including 49 subcortical volumes, 68 cortical volumes, 68 cortical thicknesses, 
70 surface areas and 16 hippocampus subfields. Subjects with all aforementioned 
MRI measures passing quality control and valid Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG) and 
Florbetapir (18F) PET scans were selected from ADNI database, resulting in a 
total of 524 participants (137 CN, 214 EMCI, 103 LMCI and 70 AD) for the study. 
Altogether 286 features including 15 significant PET uptake features (7 for FDG 
and 8 for AV-45) were utilized for OPLS analysis. Predictive power was evaluated 
by Q2(Y), a quantifier of the statistical significance for class separation. The 
results show that MRI features (Q2(Y) =0.645), and PET features (Q2(Y) = 0.636) 
has comparable predictive power in separating AD from CN, and MRI features are 
better predictor of LMCI (Q2(Y) = 0.282) than PET (Q2(Y) = 0.294). Combination 
of PET and MRI has the most predictive power for LMCI and AD with Q2(Y) of 0.294 
and 0.721, respectively. While for EMCI, cortical thickness was found to be the 
best predictor with a Q2(Y) of 0.108, suggesting cortical thickness may be the 
first structural change ahead of others and should be prioritized in prediction 
of very mild cognitive impairment.

PURPOSE: To introduce, evaluate and validate a voxel-based analysis method of 
¹⁸F-FDG PET imaging for determining the probability of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
in a particular individual.
METHODS: The subject groups for model derivation comprised 80 healthy subjects 
(HS), 36 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who converted to AD 
dementia within 18 months, 85 non-converter MCI patients who did not convert 
within 24 months, and 67 AD dementia patients with baseline FDG PET scan were 
recruited from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Additionally, 
baseline FDG PET scans from 20 HS, 27 MCI and 21 AD dementia patients from our 
institutional cohort were included for model validation. The analysis technique 
was designed on the basis of the AD-related hypometabolic convergence index 
adapted for our laboratory-specific context (AD-PET index), and combined in a 
multivariable model with age and gender for AD dementia detection (AD score). A 
logistic regression analysis of different cortical PET indexes and clinical 
variables was applied to search for relevant predictive factors to include in 
the multivariable model for the prediction of MCI conversion to AD dementia 
(AD-Conv score). The resultant scores were stratified into sixtiles for 
probabilistic diagnosis.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 
the AD score detecting AD dementia in the ADNI database was 0.879, and the 
observed probability of AD dementia in the six defined groups ranged from 8% to 
100% in a monotonic trend. For predicting MCI conversion to AD dementia, only 
the posterior cingulate index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and 
apolipoprotein E4 genotype (ApoE4) exhibited significant independent effects in 
the univariable and multivariable models. When only the latter two clinical 
variables were included in the model, the AUC was 0.742 (95% CI 0.646 - 0.838), 
but this increased to 0.804 (95% CI 0.714 - 0.894, bootstrap p=0.027) with the 
addition of the posterior cingulate index (AD-Conv score). Baseline clinical 
diagnosis of MCI showed 29.7% of converters after 18 months. The observed 
probability of conversion in relation to baseline AD-Conv score was 75% in the 
high probability group (sixtile 6), 34% in the medium probability group (merged 
sixtiles 4 and 5), 20% in the low probability group (sixtile 3) and 7.5% in the 
very low probability group (merged sixtiles 1 and 2). In the validation 
population, the AD score reached an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI 0.625 - 0.969) and the 
AD-Conv score reached 0.968 (95% CI 0.908 - 1.000), with AD patients and MCI 
converters included in the highest probability categories.
CONCLUSION: Posterior cingulate hypometabolism, when combined in a multivariable 
model with age and gender as well as MMSE score and ApoE4 data, improved the 
determination of the likelihood of patients with MCI converting to AD dementia 
compared with clinical variables alone. The probabilistic model described here 
provides a new tool that may aid in the clinical diagnosis of AD and MCI 
conversion.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological process of amyloid-β, tau deposition, and 
neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin in a preclinical phase, 
while anxiety is associated with an increased risk of AD in preclinical phase.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between anxiety and amyloid-β, tau 
deposition, and neurodegeneration. To test the hypothesis that anxiety could 
predict clinical progression in the elderly without dementia.
METHODS: 1,400 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database were included in the study and were studied over a median period 
of 3 years. In multivariable models, the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations between anxiety and amyloid-β PET, tau PET, and FDG PET SUVRs in 
participants without dementia were explored using Spearman rank correlation, 
logistic regression model, multiple linear regression model, Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves, and Cox proportional hazards model. The association between 
baseline anxiety and clinical progression was also explored.
RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between anxiety and amyloid-β 
deposition (r = 0.11, p = 0.0017) and a negative correlation between anxiety and 
neurodegeneration (r = -0.13, p = 0.00022). MCI participants with anxiety showed 
a faster clinical progression of dementia (HR = 1.56, p = 0.04). Non-anxious 
participants with more amyloid-β deposition or more severe neurodegeneration 
displayed accelerated development into anxiety (HR = 2.352, p < 0.0001; 
HR = 2.254, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Anxiety was associated with amyloid-β deposition and 
neurodegeneration in non-dementia elderly. Anxiety in MCI predicted conversion 
to dementia. Anxiety may play a selective role and prediction of disease 
progression in the early phase of AD.

Introduction: This study aimed to survey the discrimination power of parameters 
from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET 
(FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional MRI in 
high- and low-risk subjects or in converters and stable subjects of normal and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) statuses. Methods: We used baseline 
resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) dataset to analyze functional networks and recorded subjects' 
characteristics and results of the CSF study, FDG-PET, and structural MRI from 
the ADNI website. All parameters were evaluated based on the between-group 
difference among normal (NC), MCI, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. The 
parameters other than CSF results were included to study the difference between 
high- and low-AD-risk subjects in NC or MCI groups, based on CSF results. On the 
basis of two-year follow-up conditions, all parameters were compared between 
stable subjects and converters in NC and MCI. Results: CSF biomarkers, FDG-PET, 
structural MRI, and functional MRI are all able to differentiate AD from MCI or 
NC but not between MCI and NC. As compared with low-AD-risk subjects, high-risk 
subjects present decreased FDG-PET in both MCI and NC groups but structural MRI 
change only in MCI status and rfMRI alteration only in NC status. As compared 
with stable subjects, converters have decreased FDG-PET, functional network 
changes, and structural changes in both MCI and NC groups. Conclusion: The 
combination of functional and structural MRI is a safer screening tool but with 
similar power as FDG-PET to reflect CSF change in the AD pathological process 
and to identify high-risk subjects and converters in NC and MCI.

Whether the deleterious effects of APOE4 are restricted to the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) spectrum or cause cognitive impairment irrespectively of the 
development of AD is still a matter of debate, and the focus of this study. Our 
analyses included APOE4 genotype, neuropsychological variables, amyloid-βeta 
(Aβ) and Tau markers, FDG-PET values, and hippocampal volumetry data derived 
from the healthy controls sample of the ADNI database. We formed 4 groups of 
equal size (n = 30) based on APOE4 carriage and amyloid-PET status. Baseline and 
follow-up (i.e., 48 months post-baseline) results indicated that Aβ-positivity 
was the most important factor to explain poorer cognitive performance, while 
APOE4 only exerted a significant effect in Aβ-positive subjects. Additionally, 
multiple regression analyses evidenced that, within the Aβ-positive sample, 
hippocampal volumetry explained most of the variability in cognitive performance 
for APOE4 carriers. These findings represent a strong support for the so-called 
preclinical/prodromal hypothesis, which states that the reported differences in 
cognitive performance between healthy carriers and non-carriers are mainly due 
to the APOE4's capability to increase the risk of AD. Moreover, our results 
reinforce the notion that a synergistic interaction of Aβ and APOE4 elicits a 
neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus that might be the main cause of 
impaired cognitive performance.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal accumulation time for three-dimensional 
positron emission tomography (3D-PET) with (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose 
((18)F-FDG) to detect the brain uptake pattern typical of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
METHODS: Patients with mild AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
normal control subjects were recruited in the Japanese Alzheimer's disease 
neuroimaging initiative and examined with a PET scan during the 30-60 min after 
FDG injection. Three independent blinded experts interpreted the 30- to 60-min 
sum images, and images of patients with AD and MCI presenting AD patterns and 
normal subjects presenting normal patterns were used in the analysis. Early-scan 
(ES) and late-scan (LS) images were obtained from the data acquired at 30-35 min 
and 55-60 min after the injection, respectively. Separate target regions of 
interest (ROI) for ES and LS were defined as areas of significant reductions in 
the posterior cingulate and parietotemporal lobe in both hemispheres from the 
results of an initial cohort with 21 patients (AD 16, MCI 5) and 19 controls. A 
subsequent sample of 36 (AD 9, MCI 27) patients and 38 controls were used to 
compare the diagnostic capability of ES and LS using Z scores within the target 
ROI in individual statistical parametric mapping analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to LS, ES showed lower activity in the frontal lobes and 
higher activity in the venous sinus than LS; however, the diagnostic capability 
of ES and LS did not significantly differ (sensitivity 0.97 and 0.97, 
specificity 0.82 and 0.84, area under the receiver-operating characteristic 
curve 0.96 and 0.97, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: For a qualitative diagnosis of the AD pattern in 3D FDG-PET, 
results of ES were equivalent to those of LS. ES may be an option to shorten the 
entire PET procedure time, particularly in diagnosing early stages of AD.

Research into cognitive resilience imaging markers may help determine the 
clinical significance of Alzheimer's disease pathology among older adults over 
80 years (80+). In this study, we aimed to identify a fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG)-PET based imaging marker of cognitive resilience. We identified 457 
participants ≥ 80 years old (357 cognitively unimpaired, 118 cognitively 
impaired at baseline, mean age of 83.5 ± 3.2 years) from the population-based 
Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) with baseline MRI, Pittsburgh compound B-PET 
and FDG-PET scans and neuropsychological evaluation. We identified a subset of 
'resilient' participants (cognitively stable 80+, n = 192) who maintained normal 
cognition for an average of 5 years (2-10 years). Global PIB ratio, FDG-PET 
ratio and cortical thickness from Alzheimer's disease signature regions were 
used as Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarker outcomes and global cognitive 
z-score was used as a cognitive outcome. First, using voxel-wise multiple 
regression analysis, we identified the metabolic areas underlying cognitive 
resilience in cognitively stable 80+ participants, which we call the 'resilience 
signature'. Second, using multivariate linear regression models, we evaluated 
the association of risk and protective factors with the resilience signature and 
its added value for predicting global cognition beyond established Alzheimer's 
disease imaging biomarkers in the full 80+ sample. Third, we evaluated the 
utility of the resilience signature in conjunction with amyloidosis in 
predicting longitudinal cognition using linear mixed effect models. Lastly, we 
assessed the utility of the resilience signature in an independent cohort using 
ADNI (n = 358, baseline mean age of 80 ± 3.8). Our main findings were: (i) 
FDG-PET uptake in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and anterior temporal 
pole was associated with baseline global cognition in cognitively stable 80+ 
(the resilience signature); (ii) established Alzheimer's disease imaging 
biomarkers did not predict baseline global cognition in this subset of 
participants; (iii) in the full MCSA 80+ and ADNI cohorts, amyloid burden and 
FDG-PET in the resilience signature were the stronger predictors of baseline 
global cognition; (iv) sex and systemic vascular health predicted FDG-PET in the 
resilience signature, suggesting vascular health maintenance as a potential 
pathway to preserve the metabolism of these areas; and (v) the resilience 
signature provided significant information about global longitudinal cognitive 
change even when considering amyloid status in both the MCSA and ADNI cohorts. 
The FDG-PET resilience signature may be able to provide important information in 
conjunction with other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers for the determination of 
clinical prognosis. It may also facilitate identification of disease targeting 
modifiable risk factors such as vascular health maintenance.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disease that severely damages 
human thinking and memory. Early diagnosis plays an important part in the 
prevention and treatment of AD. Neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis 
(CAD) has shown that deep learning methods using multimodal images are 
beneficial to guide AD detection. In recent years, many methods based on 
multimodal feature learning have been proposed to extract and fuse latent 
representation information from different neuroimaging modalities including 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET). However, these methods lack the interpretability required 
to clearly explain the specific meaning of the extracted information. To make 
the multimodal fusion process more persuasive, we propose an image fusion method 
to aid AD diagnosis. Specifically, we fuse the gray matter (GM) tissue area of 
brain MRI and FDG-PET images by registration and mask coding to obtain a new 
fused modality called "GM-PET." The resulting single composite image emphasizes 
the GM area that is critical for AD diagnosis, while retaining both the contour 
and metabolic characteristics of the subject's brain tissue. In addition, we use 
the three-dimensional simple convolutional neural network (3D Simple CNN) and 3D 
Multi-Scale CNN to evaluate the effectiveness of our image fusion method in 
binary classification and multi-classification tasks. Experiments on the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset indicate that the 
proposed image fusion method achieves better overall performance than unimodal 
and feature fusion methods, and that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for 
AD diagnosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a cascade of pathological events 
involving formation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques and tau-based 
neurofibrillary tangles, changes in brain structure and function, and 
eventually, cognitive impairment and functional disability. The precise sequence 
of when each of these disease markers becomes abnormal is not yet clearly 
understood. The present study systematically tested the relationship between 
classes of biomarkers according to a proposed model of temporal sequence by Jack 
et al. (Lancet Neurology 9:119-128, 2010). We examined temporal relations among 
four classes of biomarkers: CSF Aβ, CSF tau, neuroimaging variables (hippocampal 
volume, ventricular volume, FDG PET), and cognitive variables (memory and 
executive function). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data obtained from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was used to test 
hypotheses that putative earlier markers of AD predicted change in later 
markers, and that intervening markers reduced effects of earlier on later 
markers. Specifically, we hypothesized that CSF tau would explain CSF Aβ's 
relation to neuroimaging and cognitive variables, and neuroimaging variables 
would explain tau's relation to cognitive variables. Consistent with hypotheses, 
results indicated that CSF Aβ effects on cognition change were substantially 
attenuated by CSF tau and measures of brain structure and function, and CSF tau 
effects on cognitive change were attenuated by neuroimaging variables. Contrary 
to hypotheses, CSF Aβ and CSF tau were observed to have independent effects on 
neuroimaging and CSF tau had a direct effect on baseline cognition independent 
of brain structure and function. These results have implications for clarifying 
the temporal sequence of AD changes and corresponding biomarkers.

PURPOSE: Increased blood glucose level (BGL) has been reported to cause 
alterations of FDG uptake in the brain that mimic Alzheimer's disease (AD), even 
within the "acceptable" range ≤ 160 mg/dl. The aim of this study was (i) to 
confirm this in a large sample of well-characterized normal control (NC) 
subjects, and (ii) to analyze its impact on the prediction of AD dementia (ADD) 
in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The study included NCs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) that were cognitively stable for ≥36 months after PET (n = 87, 
74.2 ± 5.3 y), and ADNI MCIs with ≥36 months follow-up if not progressed to ADD 
earlier (n = 323, 71.1 ± 7.1 y). Seventy-three of the MCIs had progressed to ADD 
within 36 months. In the NCs, parenchyma-scaled FDG uptake was tested for 
clusters of correlation with BGL on the family-wise, error-corrected 5% level. 
In the MCIs, ROC analysis was used to assess the power of FDG uptake in a 
predefined AD-typical region for prediction of ADD. ROC analysis was repeated 
after correcting mean FDG uptake in the AD-typical region for BGL based on 
linear regression in the NCs.
RESULTS: In the NCs, BGL (59-149 mg/dl) was negatively correlated with FDG 
uptake in a cluster comprising the occipital cortex and precuneus but sparing 
the posterior cingulate, independent of amyloid-β and ApoE4 status. In the MCIs, 
FDG uptake in the AD-typical region provided an area of 0.804 under the ROC 
curve for prediction of ADD. Correcting FDG uptake in the AD-typical region for 
BGL (55-189 mg/dl) did not change predictive performance (area = 0.808, 
p = 0.311).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BGL is associated with relative reduction of FDG uptake 
in the posterior cortex even in the "acceptable" range ≤ 160 mg/dl. The 
BGL-associated pattern is similar to the typical AD pattern, but not identical. 
BGL-associated variability of regional FDG uptake has no relevant impact on the 
power of FDG PET for prediction of MCI-to-ADD progression.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease 
with a poorly understood etiology, shown to be partly genetic. Glucose 
hypometabolism, extracellular Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and intracellular 
Tau deposition are cardinal features of AD and display characteristic spatial 
patterns in the brain. We hypothesize that regional differences in underlying 
gene expression confer either resistance or susceptibility to AD pathogenic 
processes and are associated with these spatial patterns. Data-driven methods 
for the identification of genes involved in AD pathogenesis complement 
hypothesis-driven approaches that reflect current theories about the disease. 
Here we present a data driven method for the identification of genes involved in 
AD pathogenesis based on comparing spatial patterns of normal gene expression to 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of glucose hypometabolism, Aβ 
deposition, and Tau deposition.
METHODS: We performed correlations between the cerebral cortex microarray 
samples from the six cognitively normal (CN) post-mortem Allen Human Brain Atlas 
(AHBA) specimens and PET FDG-18, AV-45, and AV-1451 tracer images from AD and CN 
participants in the Alzheimer's Disease and Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Correlation coefficients for each gene by each ADNI subject were then 
entered into a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to determine 
sets that best classified the AD and CN groups. Pathway analysis via BioPlanet 
2019 was then used to infer the function of implicated genes.
RESULTS: We identified distinct sets of genes strongly associated with each PET 
modality. Pathway analyses implicated novel genes involved in mitochondrial 
function, and Notch signaling, as well as genes previously associated with AD.
CONCLUSION: Using an unbiased approach, we derived sets of genes with expression 
patterns spatially associated with FDG hypometabolism, Aβ deposition, and Tau 
deposition in AD. This methodology may complement population-based approaches 
for identifying the genetic underpinnings of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a practical method to rapidly utilize a deep learning 
model to automatically extract image features based on a small number of SPECT 
brain perfusion images in general clinics to objectively evaluate Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: For the properties of low cost and convenient access in general 
clinics, Tc-99-ECD SPECT imaging data in brain perfusion detection was used in 
this study for AD detection. Two-stage transfer learning based on the Inception 
v3 network model was performed using the ImageNet dataset and ADNI database. To 
improve training accuracy, the three-dimensional image was reorganized into 
three sets of two-dimensional images for data augmentation and ensemble 
learning. The effect of pre-training parameters for Tc-99m-ECD SPECT image to 
distinguish AD from normal cognition (NC) was investigated, as well as the 
effect of the sample size of F-18-FDG PET images used in pre-training. The same 
model was also fine-tuned for the prediction of the MMSE score from the 
Tc-99m-ECD SPECT image.
RESULTS: The AUC values of w/wo pre-training parameters for Tc-99m-ECD SPECT 
image to distinguish AD from NC were 0.86 and 0.90. The sensitivity, 
specificity, precision, accuracy, and F1 score were 100%, 75%, 76%, 86%, and 
86%, respectively for the training model with 1000 cases of F-18-FDG PET image 
for pre-training. The AUC values for various sample sizes of the training 
dataset (100, 200, 400, 800, 1000 cases) for pre-training were 0.86, 0.91, 0.95, 
0.97, and 0.97. Regardless of the pre-training condition ECD dataset used, the 
AUC value was greater than 0.85. Finally, predicting cognitive scores and MMSE 
scores correlated (R2 = 0.7072).
CONCLUSIONS: With the ADNI pre-trained model, the sensitivity and accuracy of 
the proposed deep learning model using SPECT ECD perfusion images to 
differentiate AD from NC were increased by approximately 30% and 10%, 
respectively. Our study indicated that the model trained on PET FDG metabolic 
imaging for the same disease could be transferred to a small sample of SPECT 
cerebral perfusion images. This model will contribute to the practicality of 
SPECT cerebral perfusion images using deep learning technology to objectively 
recognize AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography 
(18F-FDG PET) is one of the imaging biomarkers to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD). In 18F-FDG PET images, the changes of voxels' intensities reflect the 
differences of glucose rates, therefore voxel intensity is usually used as a 
feature to distinguish AD from Normal Control (NC), or at earlier stage to 
distinguish between progressive and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI and 
sMCI). In this paper, 18F-FDG PET images are characterized in an alternative 
way-the spatial gradient, which is motivated by the observation that the changes 
of 18F-FDG rates also cause gradient changes.
METHODS: We improve Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor to quantify 
spatial gradients, thereby achieving the goal of diagnosing AD. First, the 
spatial gradient of 18F-FDG PET image is computed, and then each subject is 
segmented into different regions by using an anatomical atlas. Second, two types 
of improved HOG features are extracted from each region, namely Small Scale HOG 
and Large Scale HOG, then some relevant regions are selected based on a 
classifier fed with spatial gradient features. Last, an ensemble classification 
framework is designed to make a decision, which considers the performance of 
both individual and concatenated selected regions.
RESULTS: the evaluation is done on ADNI dataset. The proposed method outperforms 
other state-of-the-art 18F-FDG PET-based algorithms for AD vs. NC with an 
accuracy, a sensitivity and a specificity values of 93.65%, 91.22% and 96.25%, 
respectively. For the case of pMCI vs. sMCI, the three metrics are 75.38%, 
74.84% and 77.11%, which is significantly better than most existing methods. 
Besides, promising results are also achieved for multiple classifications under 
18F-FDG PET modality.
CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG PET images can be characterized by spatial gradient 
features for diagnosing AD and its early stage, and the proposed ensemble 
framework can enhance the classification performance.

INTRODUCTION: Studying the spatiotemporal patterns of amyloid accumulation in 
the brain over time is crucial in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging plays a pivotal role because it 
allows for the visualization and quantification of abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) 
load in the living brain, providing a powerful tool for tracking disease 
progression and evaluating the efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies. Generative 
artificial intelligence (AI) can learn complex data distributions and generate 
realistic synthetic images. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the 
potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to build a low-dimensional 
representation space that effectively describes brain amyloid load and its 
dynamics.
METHODS: Using a cohort of 1,259 subjects with AV45 PET images from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we develop a 3D GAN model to 
project images into a latent representation space and generate back synthetic 
images. Then, we build a progression model on the representation space based on 
non-parametric ordinary differential equations to study brain amyloid evolution.
RESULTS: We found that global SUVR can be accurately predicted with a linear 
regression model only from the latent representation space (RMSE = 0.08 ± 0.01). 
We generated synthetic PET trajectories and illustrated predicted Aβ change in 
four years compared with actual progression.
DISCUSSION: Generative AI can generate rich representations for statistical 
prediction and progression modeling and simulate evolution in synthetic 
patients, providing an invaluable tool for understanding AD, assisting in 
diagnosis, and designing clinical trials. The aim of this study was to 
illustrate the huge potential that generative AI has in brain amyloid imaging 
and to encourage its advancement by providing use cases and ideas for future 
research tracks.

The goal was to improve Alzheimer's 2-deoxy-2-(18)F-fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F 
FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging through 
application of a novel, hybrid Fourier-wavelet windowed Fourier transform (WFT) 
restoration technique, in order to provide earlier and more accurate clinical 
results. General Electric Medical Systems downward-looking sonar PET/CT 16 slice 
system was used to acquire studies. Patient data were acquired according the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Here, we 
implemented Fourier-wavelet regularized restoration, with a Butterworth low-pass 
filter, order n = 6 and a cut-off frequency f = 0.35 cycles/pixel and wavelet 
(Daubechies, order 2) noise suppression. The original (PET-O) and restored 
(PET-R) ADNI subject PET images were compared using the Alzheimer's 
discrimination analysis by dedicated software. Forty-two PET/CT scans were used 
in the study. They were performed on eleven ADNI subjects at intervals of 
approximately 6 months. The final clinical diagnosis was used as a gold 
standard. For three subjects, the final clinical diagnosis was mild cognitive 
impairment and those 13 PET/CT studies were not included in the final 
comparison, as the result was considered as inconclusive. Using the reminding 29 
PET/CT studies (23 AD and 6 normal), the sensitivity and specificity of the 
PET-O and PET-R were calculated. The sensitivity was 0.65 and 0.96 for PET-O and 
PET-R, respectively, and the specificity was 0.67 and 0.50 for PET-O and PET-R. 
The accuracy was 0.66 and 0.86 for PET-O and PET-R, respectively. The results of 
the study demonstrated that the accuracy of three-dimensional brain F-18 FDG PET 
images was significantly improved by Fourier-wavelet restoration filtering.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), including its mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase 
that may or may not progress into the AD, is the most ordinary form of dementia. 
It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage 
because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial 
to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on 
only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. 
Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different 
biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also 
increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. 
In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to 
discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different 
biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein 
levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In 
total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were 
available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects 
were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 
24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD 
within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the 
healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest 
(as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and 
later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features 
obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. 
Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) 
classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained 
features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition 
(Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional 
features into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method 
achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve of 
98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD 
vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs subjects which are high 
relative to single modality results and other state-of-the-art approaches. 
Moreover, combined multimodal methods have improved the classification 
performance over the unimodal classification.

After the paper Cognition or genetics. Predicting progression to Alzheimer's 
disease with practice effects, APOE genotype and brain metabolism [Neurobiol 
Aging, 2018; 71:234-240] was published, we identified a coding error of one of 
the variables analyzed. To correct, update and expand the previous work, we 
compared simple and complex regression-based Reliable Change Index (RCIRB) to 
analyze the risk of progression to AD (AD-risk) after six years using either 
delayed recall or recognition scores. Auditory Verbal Learning Test scores at 
six months for 394 individuals with normal cognition from the ADNI were used to 
build the regression. In 816 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive 
impairments, the AD-risk was associated with age, brain metabolism, APOE-ε4, 
recognition hits, the discrimination index, and low practice effects in the 
complex RCIRB only. The complex RCIRB outperformed the simple RCIRB. Small 
correlations were found between practice effects and both Aβ (highest r = 0.218) 
and TAU (highest r = -0.183). RCIRB are computationally simple and provide 
sensitive AD-risk estimates in combination with APOE-ε4 and FDG-PET.

With the strengths of deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a hot 
topic for researchers in medical image analysis. One of the main requirements 
for training a deep learning model is providing enough data for the network. 
However, in medical images, due to the difficulties of data collection and data 
privacy, finding an appropriate dataset (balanced, enough samples, etc.) is 
quite a challenge. Although image synthesis could be beneficial to overcome this 
issue, synthesizing 3D images is a hard task. The main objective of this paper 
is to generate 3D T1 weighted MRI corresponding to FDG-PET. In this study, we 
propose a separable convolution-based Elicit generative adversarial network 
(E-GAN). The proposed architecture can reconstruct 3D T1 weighted MRI from 2D 
high-level features and geometrical information retrieved from a Sobel filter. 
Experimental results on the ADNI datasets for healthy subjects show that the 
proposed model improves the quality of images compared with the state of the 
art. In addition, the evaluation of E-GAN and the state of art methods gives a 
better result on the structural information (13.73% improvement for PSNR and 
22.95% for SSIM compared to Pix2Pix GAN) and textural information (6.9% 
improvements for homogeneity error in Haralick features compared to Pix2Pix 
GAN).

Relationship between serum calcium and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. 
The aim of this study is to test whether serum calcium is associated with other 
AD-associated biomarkers and could predict clinical progression in nondemented 
elders. This was a longitudinal population-based study. The sample was derived 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, which 
included 1224 nondemented elders: 413 cognitively normal (CN) and 811 mild 
cognition impairment (MCI). Associations were investigated between serum calcium 
and longitudinal changes in Aβ/tau pathologic features, brain structure, 
cognitive function, and disease progression. Serum calcium concentrations 
increased with disease severity. Serum calcium predicted longitudinal cognitive 
decline and conversion from nondemented status to AD dementia (adjusted 
HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13-1.76). Furthermore, serum calcium levels were negatively 
correlated with CSF-Aβ42 (β = - 0.558, P = 0.008), FDG-PET (β = - 0.292, 
P < 0.001), whole brain volume (β = - 0.148, P = 0.001), and middle temporal 
volume (β = - 0.216, P = 0.042). Similar results were obtained in CN and MCI 
groups. Higher serum calcium status (even if not hypercalcemia) may increase the 
risk of AD in elders. Serum calcium is a useful biomarker in predicting clinical 
progression in nondemented elders. More researches are needed in the future to 
explore the underlying mechanism.

The probable-amnestic (Pr-a) mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-storage subtype is 
a phenotype with 8.5 times more risk of conversion to dementia, mainly 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), than the possible non-amnestic (Pss-na) MCI. The aim 
of this study was to find the optimized cognitive composites (CCs) domain scores 
most related to neuroimaging biomarkers within Pr-aMCI-storage subtype patients. 
The Fundació ACE (ACE) study with 20 Pr-aMCI-storage subtype subjects (MCI) were 
analyzed. All subjects underwent a neuropsychological assessment, a structural 
MRI, FDG-PET, and PIB-PET. The adjusted hippocampal volume (aHV) on MRI, the 
standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) on FDG-PET and PIB-PET SUVR measures were 
analyzed. The construction of the CCs domain scores, and the aHV on MRI and 
FDG-PET SUVR measures, were replicated in the parental AB255 study database 
(n = 133 MCI). Partial correlations adjusted by age, gender, and education were 
calculated with the associated p-value among every CC domain score and the 
neuroimaging biomarkers. The results were replicated in the "MCI due to AD" with 
memory storage impairments from ADNI. Delayed Recall CC domain score was 
significantly correlated with PIB-PET SUVR (β= -0.61, p = 0.003) in the ACE 
study and also with aHV on MRI (β= 0.27, p = 0.01) and FDG-PET SUVR (β= 0.27, 
p = 0.01) in the AB255 study. After a median survival time of 20.6 months, 85% 
from the ACE MCI converted to AD. The replication of our results in the ADNI 
dataset also confirmed our findings. Delayed Recall is the CC domain score best 
correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers associated with prodromal AD diagnosis.

The alterations of brain structures and functions have been considered closely 
correlated to the change of cognitive performance due to neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we introduce a variational 
framework to compute the optimal transformation (OT) in 3D space and propose a 
univariate neuroimaging index based on OT to measure such alterations. We 
compute the OT from each image to a template and measure the Wasserstein 
distance between them. By comparing the distances from all the images to the 
common template, we obtain a concise and informative index for each image. Our 
framework makes use of the Newton's method, which reduces the computational cost 
and enables itself to be applicable to large-scale datasets. The proposed work 
is a generic approach and thus may be applicable to various volumetric brain 
images, including structural magnetic resonance (sMR) and fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images. In the classification between 
Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, our method achieves an 
accuracy of 82.30% on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
baseline sMRI dataset and outperforms several other indices. On FDG-PET dataset, 
we boost the accuracy to 88.37% by leveraging pairwise Wasserstein distances. In 
a longitudinal study, we obtain a 5% significance with p-value = 1.13×105 in a 
t-test on FDG-PET. The results demonstrate a great potential of the proposed 
index for neuroimage analysis and the precision medicine research.

Rare variants of phospholipase D3 (PLD3) have been identified as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) susceptibility loci, whereas little is known about the potential 
role of common variants in the progression of AD. To examine the impact of 
genetic variations in PLD3 on neuroimaging phenotypes in a large non-demented 
population. A total of 261 normal cognition (NC) and 456 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database are included in our analysis. Multiple linear 
regression models were applied to examine the association between four 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs7249146, rs4490097, rs12151243, and 
rs10407447) with the florbetapir retention on florbetapir 18F amyloid positron 
emission tomography (AV45-PET), the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) 
on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), and regional volume on magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and in the cohort study. We did not detect 
any significant associations of PLD3 SNPs with florbetapir retention on 
AV45-PET. In the analysis of FDG-PET, rs10407447 was associated with the CMRgl 
in the left angular gyrus and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex in the MCI 
group. Regarding the MRI analysis, rs10407447 was also associated with bilateral 
inferior lateral ventricle and lateral ventricle volume in MCI group. The main 
findings of our study provide evidence that support the possible role of PLD3 
common variants in influencing AD-related neuroimaging phenotypes. Nevertheless, 
further work is necessary to explain the functional mechanisms of differences 
and confirm the causal variants.

Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging based 3D 
topographic brain glucose metabolism patterns from normal controls (NC) and 
individuals with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) are used to train a novel 
multi-scale ensemble classification model. This ensemble model outputs a FDG-PET 
DAT score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject to be 
clinically diagnosed with DAT based on their metabolism profile. A novel 7 group 
image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only based on 
their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future trajectories of 
the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous representation of the 
different stages of DAT spectrum that mimics a real-world clinical setting. The 
potential for using FPDS as a DAT biomarker was validated on a large number of 
FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed stratification, and a good 
classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78 was achieved in distinguishing 
between images belonging to subjects on a DAT trajectory and those images taken 
from subjects not progressing to a DAT diagnosis. Further, the FPDS biomarker 
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to 
DAT conversion prediction task with an AUC of 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 for the 2, 3, 
5 years to conversion windows respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential clinical value of quantitative functional 
FDG PET and pathological amyloid-β PET with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
and clinical assessments in the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression.
METHODS: We studied 82 subjects for up to 96 months (median = 84 months) in a 
longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. All 
preprocessed PET images were spatially normalized to standard Montreal 
Neurologic Institute space. Regions of interest (ROI) were defined on MRI 
template, and standard uptake values ratios (SUVRs) to the cerebellum for FDG 
and amyloid-β PET were calculated. Predictive values of single and 
multiparametric PET biomarkers with and without clinical assessments and CSF 
biomarkers for AD progression were evaluated using receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression model.
RESULTS: The posterior precuneus and cingulate SUVRs were identified for both 
FDG and amyloid-β PET in predicating progression in normal controls (NCs) and 
subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). FDG parietal and lateral temporal 
SUVRs were suggested for monitoring NCs and MCI group progression, respectively. 
18F-AV45 global cortex attained (78.6%, 74.5%, 75.4%) (sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy) in predicting NC progression, which is comparable to the 11C-PiB 
global cortex SUVR's in predicting MCI to AD. A logistic regression model to 
combine FDG parietal and posterior precuneus SUVR and Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) Total Mod was identified in predicating NC 
progression with (80.0%, 94.9%, 93.9%) (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy). The 
selected model including FDG posterior cingulate SUVR, ADAS-Cog Total Mod, and 
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores for predicating MCI to AD attained (96.4%, 
81.2%, 83.6%) (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy). 11C-PiB medial temporal SUVR 
with MMSE significantly increased 11C-PiB PET AUC to 0.915 (p<0.05) in 
predicating MCI to AD with (77.8%, 90.4%, 88.5%) (sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy).
CONCLUSION: Quantitative FDG and 11C-PiB PET with clinical cognitive assessments 
significantly improved accuracy in the predication of AD progression.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive and 
irreversible dementia, and accurate diagnosis of AD at its prodromal stage is 
clinically important. Currently, computer-aided diagnosis of AD and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) using 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission 
tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features 
or deep learning methods, which have difficulties in achieving sufficient 
classification accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore 
aimed to implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics, to 
improve the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can 
reveal pathological information.
METHODS: In this study, 18F-FDG PET and clinical assessments were collected in a 
cohort of 422 individuals [including 130 with AD, 130 with MCI, and 162 healthy 
controls (HCs)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
44 individuals (including 22 with AD, and 22 HCs) from Huashan Hospital, 
Shanghai, China. First, we performed a group comparison using a two-sample 
Student's t test to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) based on 30 AD 
patients and 30 HCs from ADNI cohorts. Second, based on two time scans of 32 HCs 
from ADNI cohorts, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficient for radiomic feature 
stability analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficients were regarded as a 
feature selection criterion, to select effective features associated with the 
clinical cognitive scale [clinical dementia rating scale in its sum of boxes 
(CDRSB); Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)] with 500-times 
cross-validation. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to test the 
ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD patients.
RESULTS: As a result, we identified brain regions which were mainly distributed 
in the temporal, occipital and frontal areas as ROIs. A total of 168 radiomic 
features of AD were stable (alpha > 0.8). The classification experiment led to 
maximal accuracies of 91.5%, 83.1% and 85.9% for classifying AD versus HC, MCI 
versus HCs and AD versus MCI.
CONCLUSION: The research in this paper proved that the novel approach based on 
high-order radiomic features extracted from 18F-FDG PET brain images that can be 
used for AD and MCI computer-aided diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) are risk factors for early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may 
accelerate the progression rate of AD pathology. As amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques 
are a hallmark of AD pathology, we hypothesized that TBI and PTSD might increase 
Aβ accumulation in the brain.
METHODS: We examined PET and neuropsychological data from Vietnam War veterans 
compiled by the US Department of Defense Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative, to examine the spatial distribution of Aβ in male veterans' who had 
experienced a TBI and/or developed PTSD. Subjects were classified into controls, 
TBI only, PTSD only, and TBI with PTSD (TBI_PTSD) groups and data were analyzed 
using both voxel-based and ROI-based approaches.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, all three clinical groups showed a pattern of 
mainly increased referenced standard uptake values (SUVR) for the amyloid tracer 
[18F]-AV45 PET, with rank order PTSD > TBI_PTSD > TBI > Control, and same rank 
order was seen in the deficits of cognitive functions. SUVR increase was 
observed in widespread cortical regions of the PTSD group; in white matter of 
the TBI_PTSD group; and cerebellum and precuneus area of the TBI group, in 
contrast with controls. The [18F]-AV45 SUVR correlated negatively with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid levels and positively with the CSF tau 
concentrations.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both TBI and PTSD are substantial risk 
factors for cognition decline and increased Aβ deposition resembling that in AD. 
In addition, both PTSD and TBI_PTSD have a different pathways of Aβ 
accumulation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common and severe forms of Senile 
Dementia. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of AD 
susceptible loci. To better understand potential mechanism-of-action for AD, 
quantitative brain imaging features have been studied as mediators linking 
genetic variants to AD outcomes. In this study, Mediation analysis, Chow test 
and Mixed-effects Models are used to investigate the biological pathways by 
which genetic variants affect both brain structures/functions and disease 
diagnosis. We analyzed the imaging and genetics data collected from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, including a 
Polygenic Hazard Score (PHS) and 13 imaging quantitative traits (QTs) extracted 
from the AV45 PET scans quantifying the amyloid deposition in different brain 
regions of subjects from four separate diagnostic groups. Mediation analysis 
assessed the mediating effects of image QTs between PHS and diagnosis, whereas 
Chow test and Linear Mixed-Effects models were used to characterize intra-group 
differences in the associations between genetic scores and imaging QTs for 
different disease stages. Results show that promising stage-specific imaging QTs 
that mediate the genetic effect of the studied PHS on disease status have been 
identified, providing novel insights into the predictive power of the PHS and 
the mediating power of amyloid imaging QTs with respect to multiple stages over 
the AD progression.

OBJECTIVE: Visual evaluation is the standard for amyloid positron emission 
tomography (PET) examination, though the result depends upon the physician's 
subjective review of the images. Therefore, it is expected that objective 
quantitative evaluation is useful for image interpretation. In this study, we 
examined the usefulness of the quantitative evaluation of amyloid PET using a 
PET-only quantification method in comparison with visual evaluation.
METHODS: In this study we retrospectively investigated a total of 166 
individuals, including 58 cognitively normal controls, 62 individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment, and 46 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease. They 
underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET examination through the Japanese 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). Amyloid accumulation in 
cerebral cortices was assessed using visual and quantitative methods. The 
quantitative evaluation was performed using the adaptive template method and 
empirically PiB-prone region of interest, and the standardized uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) in each area was obtained.
RESULTS: Visual evaluation and SUVR were significantly correlated in the 
cerebral cortices (ρ = 0.85-0.87; p < 0.05). In visual evaluation, sensitivity, 
specificity, and accuracy were 78%, 76%, and 77%, respectively. Meanwhile, for 
quantitative evaluation, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 77%, 79%, 
and 78% in mean cortical SUVR (mcSUVR) and 79%, 79%, and 79% in maximum SUVR 
(maxSUVR), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The PET-only quantification method provided a concordant result with 
visual evaluation and was considered useful for amyloid PET.

In recent years, increasing attention has been given to the identification of 
the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Brain neuroimaging techniques have been widely used to support the 
classification or prediction of MCI. The present study combined magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), and 
18F-florbetapir PET (florbetapir-PET) to discriminate MCI converters (MCI-c, 
individuals with MCI who convert to AD) from MCI non-converters (MCI-nc, 
individuals with MCI who have not converted to AD in the follow-up period) based 
on the partial least squares (PLS) method. Two types of PLS models (informed PLS 
and agnostic PLS) were built based on 64 MCI-c and 65 MCI-nc from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The results showed 
that the three-modality informed PLS model achieved better classification 
accuracy of 81.40%, sensitivity of 79.69%, and specificity of 83.08% compared 
with the single-modality model, and the three-modality agnostic PLS model also 
achieved better classification compared with the two-modality model. Moreover, 
combining the three modalities with clinical test score (ADAS-cog), the agnostic 
PLS model (independent data: florbetapir-PET; dependent data: FDG-PET and MRI) 
achieved optimal accuracy of 86.05%, sensitivity of 81.25%, and specificity of 
90.77%. In addition, the comparison of PLS, support vector machine (SVM), and 
random forest (RF) showed greater diagnostic power of PLS. These results 
suggested that our multimodal PLS model has the potential to discriminate MCI-c 
from the MCI-nc and may therefore be helpful in the early diagnosis of AD.

This article introduces a hypometabolic convergence index (HCI) for the 
assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD); compares it to other biological, 
cognitive and clinical measures; and demonstrates its promise to predict 
clinical decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using data from the 
AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The HCI is intended to reflect in a single 
measurement the extent to which the pattern and magnitude of cerebral 
hypometabolism in an individual's fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) image correspond to that in probable AD patients, and is 
generated using a fully automated voxel-based image-analysis algorithm. HCIs, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal volume measurements, cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) assays, memory test scores, and clinical ratings were compared in 47 
probable AD patients, 21 MCI patients who converted to probable AD within the 
next 18months, 76 MCI patients who did not, and 47 normal controls (NCs) in 
terms of their ability to characterize clinical disease severity and predict 
conversion rates from MCI to probable AD. HCIs were significantly different in 
the probable AD, MCI converter, MCI stable and NC groups (p=9e-17) and 
correlated with clinical disease severity. Using retrospectively characterized 
threshold criteria, MCI patients with either higher HCIs or smaller hippocampal 
volumes had the highest hazard ratios (HRs) for 18-month progression to probable 
AD (7.38 and 6.34, respectively), and those with both had an even higher HR 
(36.72). In conclusion, the HCI, alone or in combination with certain other 
biomarker measurements, has the potential to help characterize AD and predict 
subsequent rates of clinical decline. More generally, our conversion index 
strategy could be applied to a range of imaging modalities and voxel-based 
image-analysis algorithms.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether white matter microstructure 
measured by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides independent 
information about baseline level or change in executive function (EF) or memory 
(MEM) in older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Longitudinal data 
was acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study 
from phases GO and 2 (2009-2015). ADNI participants included were diagnosed as 
cognitively normal (n = 46), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 48), 
late MCI (n = 29), and dementia (n = 39) at baseline. We modeled the association 
between dMRI-based global white matter mean diffusivity (MD) and baseline level 
and change in EF and MEM composite scores, in models controlling for baseline 
bilateral hippocampal volume, regional cerebral FDG PET metabolism and global 
cerebral AV45 PET uptake. EF and MEM composite scores were measured at baseline, 
6, 12, 24 and 36 months. In the baseline late MCI and dementia groups, greater 
global MD was associated with lesser baseline EF, but not EF change nor MEM 
baseline or change. As expected, lesser hippocampal volume and lesser FDG PET 
metabolism was associated with greater rates of EF and MEM decline. In ADNI-GO/2 
participants, white matter integrity provided independent information about 
current executive function, but was not sensitive to future cognitive change. 
Since individuals experiencing executive function declines progress to dementia 
more rapidly than those with only memory impairment, better biomarkers of future 
executive function decline are needed.

Background: Changes in the metabolic and structural brain networks in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) have been widely researched. However, few studies 
have compared the differences in the topological properties of the metabolic and 
structural brain networks in patients with MCI. Methods: We analyzedmagnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) data of 137 patients with MCI and 80 healthy controls (HCs). The HC 
group data comes from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. The permutation test was used to compare the network parameters 
(characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and 
global efficiency) between the two groups. Partial Pearson's correlation 
analysis was used to calculate the correlations of the changes in gray matter 
volume and glucose intake in the key brain regions in MCI with the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) sub-item scores. Results: 
Significant changes in the brain network parameters (longer characteristic path 
length, larger clustering coefficient, and lower local efficiency and global 
efficiency) were greater in the structural network than in the metabolic network 
(longer characteristic path length) in MCI patients than in HCs. We obtained the 
key brain regions (left globus pallidus, right calcarine fissure and its 
surrounding cortex, left lingual gyrus) by scanning the hubs. The volume of gray 
matter atrophy in the left globus pallidus was significantly positively 
correlated with comprehension of spoken language (p = 0.024) and word-finding 
difficulty in spontaneous speech item scores (p = 0.007) in the ADAS-cog. 
Glucose intake in the three key brain regions was significantly negatively 
correlated with remembering test instructions items in ADAS-cog (p = 0.020, p = 
0.014, and p = 0.008, respectively). Conclusion: Structural brain networks 
showed more changes than metabolic brain networks in patients with MCI. Some 
brain regions with significant changes in betweenness centrality in both 
structural and metabolic networks were associated with MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Stratification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients into risk 
subgroups using Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) presents novel opportunities for the 
development of clinical trials and disease-modifying therapies. However, the 
heterogeneous nature of AD continues to pose significant challenges for the 
clinical broadscale use of PRS. PRS remains unfit in demonstrating sufficient 
accuracy in risk prediction, particularly for individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and in allowing feasible interpretation of specific genes or 
SNPs contributing to disease risk. We propose adORS, a novel oligogenic risk 
score for AD, to better predict risk of disease by using an optimized list of 
relevant genetic risk factors.
METHODS: Using whole genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n  =  1,545), we selected 20 genes that 
exhibited the strongest correlations with FDG-PET and AV45-PET, recognized 
neuroimaging biomarkers that detect functional brain changes in AD. This subset 
of genes was incorporated into adORS to assess, in comparison to PRS, the 
prediction accuracy of CN vs. AD classification and MCI conversion prediction, 
risk stratification of the ADNI cohort, and interpretability of the genetic 
information included in the scores.
RESULTS: adORS improved AUC scores over PRS in both CN vs. AD classification and 
MCI conversion prediction. The oligogenic model also refined risk-based 
stratification, even without the assistance of APOE, thus reflecting the true 
prevalence rate of the ADNI cohort compared to PRS. Interpretation analysis 
shows that genes included in adORS, such as ATF6, EFCAB11, ING5, SIK3, and CD46, 
have been observed in similar neurodegenerative disorders and/or are supported 
by AD-related literature.
DISCUSSION: Compared to conventional PRS, adORS may prove to be a more 
appropriate choice of differentiating patients into high or low genetic risk of 
AD in clinical studies or settings. Additionally, the ability to interpret 
specific genetic information allows the focus to be shifted from general 
relative risk based on a given population to the information that adORS can 
provide for a single individual, thus permitting the possibility of personalized 
treatments for AD.

BACKGROUND: About 40-50% of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) are found to have no significant Alzheimer's pathology based on amyloid 
PET positivity. Notably, conversion to dementia in this population is known to 
occur much less often than in amyloid-positive MCI. However, the relationship 
between MCI and brain amyloid deposition remains largely unknown. Therefore, we 
investigated the influence of subthreshold levels of amyloid deposition on 
conversion to dementia in amnestic MCI patients with negative amyloid PET scans.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with 
amyloid-negative amnestic MCI who visited the memory clinic of Asan Medical 
Center. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological testing, brain 
magnetic resonance imaging, and [18F]-florbetaben (FBB) positron emission 
tomography scan (PET). Conversion to dementia was determined by a neurologist 
based on a clinical interview with a detailed neuropsychological test or a 
decline in the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination score of more 
than 4 points per year combined with impaired activities of daily living. 
Regional cortical amyloid levels were calculated, and a receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve for conversion to dementia was obtained. To increase 
the reliability of the results of the study, we analyzed the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset together.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 36% (39/107) of patients converted to 
dementia from amnestic MCI. The dementia converter group displayed increased 
standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values of FBB on PET in the bilateral 
temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, occipital, and left precuneus cortices 
as well as increased global SUVR. Among volume of interests, the left parietal 
SUVR predicted conversion to dementia with the highest accuracy in the ROC 
analysis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762, P < 0.001). The combination of 
precuneus, parietal cortex, and FBB composite SUVRs also showed a higher 
accuracy in predicting conversion to dementia than other models (AUC = 0.763). 
Of the results of ADNI data, the SUVR of the left precuneus SUVR showed the 
highest AUC (AUC = 0.596, P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that subthreshold amyloid levels may contribute 
to conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI.

OBJECTIVE: Disease-related metabolic brain patterns have been verified for a 
variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
study aimed to explore and validate the pattern derived from cognitively normal 
controls (NCs) in the Alzheimer's continuum.
METHODS: This study was based on two cohorts; one from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the other from the Sino Longitudinal Study on 
Cognitive Decline (SILCODE). Each subject underwent [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]florbetapir-PET imaging. 
Participants were binary-grouped based on β-amyloid (Aβ) status, and the 
positivity was defined as Aβ+. Voxel-based scaled subprofile model/principal 
component analysis (SSM/PCA) was used to generate the "at-risk AD-related 
metabolic pattern (ARADRP)" for NCs. The pattern expression score was obtained 
and compared between the groups, and receiver operating characteristic curves 
were drawn. Notably, we conducted cross-validation to verify the robustness and 
correlation analyses to explore the relationships between the score and 
AD-related pathological biomarkers.
RESULTS: Forty-eight Aβ+ NCs and 48 Aβ- NCs were included in the ADNI cohort, 
and 25 Aβ+ NCs and 30 Aβ- NCs were included in the SILCODE cohort. The ARADRPs 
were identified from the combined cohorts and the two separate cohorts, 
characterized by relatively lower regional loadings in the posterior parts of 
the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and regions of the temporal gyrus, as well 
as relatively higher values in the superior/middle frontal gyrus and other 
areas. Patterns identified from the two separate cohorts showed some regional 
differences, including the temporal gyrus, basal ganglia regions, anterior parts 
of the precuneus, and middle cingulate. Cross-validation suggested that the 
pattern expression score was significantly higher in the Aβ+ group of both 
cohorts (p < 0.01), and contributed to the diagnosis of Aβ+ NCs (with area under 
the curve values of 0.696-0.815). The correlation analysis revealed that the 
score was related to tau pathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid (p-tau: 
p < 0.02; t-tau: p < 0.03), but not Aβ pathology assessed with 
[18F]florbetapir-PET (p > 0.23).
CONCLUSIONS: ARADRP exists for NCs, and the acquired pattern expression score 
shows a certain ability to discriminate Aβ+ NCs from Aβ- NCs. The SSM/PCA method 
is expected to be helpful in the ultra-early diagnosis of AD in clinical 
practice.

Automated methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification have the potential 
for great clinical benefits and may provide insight for combating the disease. 
Machine learning, and more specifically deep neural networks, have been shown to 
have great efficacy in this domain. These algorithms often use neurological 
imaging data such as MRI and FDG PET, but a comprehensive and balanced 
comparison of the MRI and amyloid PET modalities has not been performed. In 
order to accurately determine the relative strength of each imaging variant, 
this work performs a comparison study in the context of Alzheimer's dementia 
classification using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset with identical neural network architectures. Furthermore, this work 
analyzes the benefits of using both modalities in a fusion setting and discusses 
how these data types may be leveraged in future AD studies using deep learning.

PURPOSE: Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common age-related diseases. Here, 
we investigate the central auditory correlates of HL in people with normal 
cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test their association with 
genetic markers with the aim of revealing pathogenic mechanisms.
METHODS: Brain glucose metabolism based on FDG-PET, self-reported HL status, and 
genetic data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort. FDG-PET data was analysed from 742 control subjects (non-HL with 
normal cognition or MCI) and 162 cases (HL with normal cognition or MCI) with 
age ranges of 72.2 ± 7.1 and 77.4 ± 6.4, respectively. Voxel-wise statistics of 
FDG uptake differences between cases and controls were computed using the 
generalised linear model in SPM12. An additional 1515 FDG-PET scans of 618 
participants were analysed using linear mixed effect models to assess 
longitudinal HL effects. Furthermore, a quantitative trait genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) was conducted on the glucose uptake within regions of 
interest (ROIs), which were defined by the voxel-wise comparison, using 
genotyping data with 5,082,878 variants available for HL cases and HL controls 
(N = 817).
RESULTS: The HL group exhibited hypometabolism in the bilateral Heschl's gyrus 
(kleft = 323; kright = 151; Tleft = 4.55; Tright = 4.14; peak Puncorr < 0.001), 
the inferior colliculus (k = 219;T = 3.53; peak Puncorr < 0.001) and cochlear 
nucleus (k = 18;T = 3.55; peak Puncorr < 0.001) after age correction and using a 
cluster forming height threshold P < 0.005 (FWE-uncorrected). Moreover, in an 
age-matched subset, the cluster comprising the left Heschl's gyrus survived the 
FWE-correction (kleft = 1903; Tleft = 4.39; cluster PFWE-corr = 0.001). The 
quantitative trait GWAS identified no genome-wide significant locus in the three 
HL ROIs. However, various loci were associated at the suggestive threshold 
(p < 1e-05).
CONCLUSION: Compared to the non-HL group, glucose metabolism in the HL group was 
lower in the auditory cortex, the inferior colliculus, and the cochlear nucleus 
although the effect sizes were small. The GWAS identified candidate genes that 
might influence FDG uptake in these regions. However, the specific biological 
pathway(s) underlying the role of these genes in FDG-hypometabolism in the 
auditory pathway requires further investigation.

INTRODUCTION: This study assessed apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status 
effects on Alzheimer's disease imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
in cognitively normal older adults with significant memory concerns (SMC).
METHODS: Cognitively normal, SMC, and early mild cognitive impairment 
participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were divided by 
APOE ε4 carrier status. Diagnostic and APOE effects were evaluated with emphasis 
on SMC. Additional analyses in SMC evaluated the effect of the interaction 
between APOE and [(18)F]Florbetapir amyloid positivity on CSF biomarkers.
RESULTS: SMC ε4+ showed greater amyloid deposition than SMC ε4-, but no 
hypometabolism or medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. SMC ε4+ showed lower 
amyloid beta 1-42 and higher tau/p-tau than ε4-, which was most abnormal in APOE 
ε4+ and cerebral amyloid positive SMC.
DISCUSSION: SMC APOE ε4+ show abnormal changes in amyloid and tau biomarkers, 
but no hypometabolism or MTL neurodegeneration, reflecting the at-risk nature of 
the SMC group and the importance of APOE in mediating this risk.

In recent years, interest has grown in using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). However, existing CAD technologies often overfit data and have poor 
generalizability. In this study, we proposed a sparse-response deep belief 
network (SR-DBN) model based on rate distortion (RD) theory and an extreme 
learning machine (ELM) model to distinguish AD, MCI, and normal controls (NC). 
We used [18F]-AV45 positron emission computed tomography (PET) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) images from 340 subjects enrolled in the ADNI database, 
including 116 AD, 82 MCI, and 142 NC subjects. The model was evaluated using 
five-fold cross-validation. In the whole model, fast principal component 
analysis (PCA) served as a dimension reduction algorithm. An SR-DBN extracted 
features from the images, and an ELM obtained the classification. Furthermore, 
to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we performed comparative trials. In 
contrast experiment 1, the ELM was replaced by a support vector machine (SVM). 
Contrast experiment 2 adopted DBN without sparsity. Contrast experiment 3 
consisted of fast PCA and an ELM. Contrast experiment 4 used a classic 
convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify AD. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were examined to validate the 
results. Our model achieved 91.68% accuracy, 95.47% sensitivity, 86.68% 
specificity, and an AUC of 0.87 separating between AD and NC groups; 87.25% 
accuracy, 79.74% sensitivity, 91.58% specificity, and an AUC of 0.79 separating 
MCI and NC groups; and 80.35% accuracy, 85.65% sensitivity, 72.98% specificity, 
and an AUC of 0.71 separating AD and MCI groups, which gave better 
classification than other models assessed.

Genetic algorithms have a proven capability to explore a large space of 
solutions, and deal with very large numbers of input features. We hypothesized 
that the application of these algorithms to 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron 
Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) may help in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) by selecting the most meaningful features and 
automating diagnosis. We aimed to develop algorithms for the three main issues 
in the diagnosis: discrimination between patients with AD or FTD and healthy 
controls (HC), differential diagnosis between behavioral FTD (bvFTD) and AD, and 
differential diagnosis between primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants. 
Genetic algorithms, customized with K-Nearest Neighbor and BayesNet Naives as 
the fitness function, were developed and compared with Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA). K-fold cross validation within the same sample and external 
validation with ADNI-3 samples were performed. External validation was performed 
for the algorithms distinguishing AD and HC. Our study supports the use of 
FDG-PET imaging, which allowed a very high accuracy rate for the diagnosis of 
AD, FTD, and related disorders. Genetic algorithms identified the most 
meaningful features with the minimum set of features, which may be relevant for 
automated assessment of brain FDG-PET images. Overall, our study contributes to 
the development of an automated, and optimized diagnosis of neurodegenerative 
disorders using brain metabolism.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. 
In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great significance to 
artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse 
modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET are widely used for this 
task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
integrate all the multi-modality information included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET 
images of the hippocampal area, for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the 
traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually 
extracted features, instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn 
features for the diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the 
proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images 
in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as CN) 
subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild cognitive 
impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild cognitive impairment 
(pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10% for CN vs. AD task, 87.46% for 
CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework 
yields a state-of-the-art performance. Finally, the results have demonstrated 
that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite when using a CNN for the 
classification, (2) the combination of two modality imaging data generates 
better results.

BACKGROUND: Fluorodeoxyglucose f18 positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is 
regarded as the only functional neuroimaging biomarker for degeneration which 
can be used to increase the certainty of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathophysiological process in research settings or as an optional clinical tool 
where available. Although a decline in FDG metabolism was confirmed in some 
regions known to be associated with AD, there was little known about the genetic 
association of FDG metabolism in AD cohorts. In this study, we present the first 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of brain FDG metabolism.
METHODS: A total of 222 individuals were included from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. All subjects were restricted to 
non-Hispanic Caucasians and met all quality control (QC) criteria. Associations 
of 18F-FDG with the genetic variants were assessed using PLINK 1.07 under the 
additive genetic model. Genome-wide associations were visualized using a 
software program R 3.2.3.
RESULTS: One significant SNP rs12444565 in RNA-binding Fox1 (RBFOX1) was found 
to have a strong association with 18F-FDG (P=6.06×10-8). Rs235141, rs79037, 
rs12526331 and rs12529764 were identified as four suggestive loci associated 
with 18F-FDG.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that a genome-wide significant SNP 
(rs12444565) in the RBFOX1, and four suggestive loci (rs235141, rs79037, 
rs12526331 and rs12529764) are associated with 18F-FDG.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid PET plays a vital role in detecting the accumulation of in 
vivo amyloid-β (Aβ). The quantification of Aβ accumulation has been widely 
performed using the region of interest (ROI)-based mean cortical standardized 
uptake value ratio (mcSUVR). However, voxel-based statistical analysis has not 
been well studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of 
analyzing amyloid PET scans by voxel-based statistical analysis. The results 
were then compared to those with the ROI-based mcSUVR. In total, 166 subjects 
who underwent 11C-PiB PET in the J-ADNI multi-center study were analyzed. 
Additionally, 18 Aβ-negative images were collected from other studies to form a 
normal database. The PET images were spatially normalized to the standard space 
using an adaptive template method without MRI. The mcSUVR was measured using a 
pre-defined ROI. Voxel-wise Z-scores within the ROI were calculated using the 
normal database, after which Z-score maps were generated. A receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate whether Z-sum (sum of 
the Z-score) and mcSUVR could be used to classify the scans into positive and 
negative using the central visual read as the reference standard. PET scans that 
were equivocal were regarded as positive.
RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were respectively 90.8% and 100% by Z-sum 
and 91.8% and 98.5% by mcSUVR. Most of the equivocal scans were subsequently 
classified by both Z-sum and mcSUVR as false negatives. Z-score maps correctly 
delineated abnormal Aβ accumulation over the same regions as the visual read.
CONCLUSIONS: We examined the usefulness of voxel-based statistical analysis for 
amyloid PET. This method provides objective Z-score maps and Z-sum values, which 
were observed to be helpful as an adjunct to visual interpretation especially 
for cases with mild or limited Aβ accumulation. This approach could improve the 
Aβ detection sensitivity, reduce inter-reader variability, and allow for 
detailed monitoring of Aβ deposition.

OBJECTIVE: Head motion during 30-min (six 5-min frames) brain PET scans starting 
30 min post-injection of FDG was evaluated together with the effect of post hoc 
motion correction between frames in J-ADNI multicenter study carried out in 24 
PET centers on a total of 172 subjects consisting of 81 normal subjects, 55 mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and 36 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: Based on the magnitude of the between-frame co-registration parameters, 
the scans were classified into six levels (A-F) of motion degree. The effect of 
motion and its correction was evaluated using between-frame variation of the 
regional FDG uptake values on ROIs placed over cerebral cortical areas.
RESULT: Although AD patients tended to present larger motion (motion level E or 
F in 22 % of the subjects) than MCI (3 %) and normal (4 %) subjects, unignorable 
motion was observed in a small number of subjects in the latter groups as well. 
The between-frame coefficient of variation (SD/mean) was 0.5 % in the frontal, 
0.6 % in the parietal and 1.8 % in the posterior cingulate ROI for the scans of 
motion level 1. The respective values were 1.5, 1.4, and 3.6 % for the scans of 
motion level F, but reduced by the motion correction to 0.5, 0.4 and 0.8 %, 
respectively. The motion correction changed the ROI value for the posterior 
cingulate cortex by 11.6 % in the case of severest motion.
CONCLUSION: Substantial head motion occurs in a fraction of subjects in a 
multicenter setup which includes PET centers lacking sufficient experience in 
imaging demented patients. A simple frame-by-frame co-registration technique 
that can be applied to any PET camera model is effective in correcting for 
motion and improving quantitative capability.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease reflected in 
markers across assessment modalities, including neuroimaging, cognitive testing, 
and evaluation of adaptive function. Identifying a single continuum of decline 
across assessment modalities in a single sample is statistically challenging 
because of the multivariate nature of the data. To address this challenge, we 
implemented advanced statistical analyses designed specifically to model complex 
data across a single continuum.
METHOD: We analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI; N = 1,056), focusing on indicators from the assessments of magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) volume, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) metabolic activity, cognitive performance, and adaptive function. Item 
response theory was used to identify the continuum of decline. Then, through a 
process of statistical scaling, indicators across all modalities were linked to 
that continuum and analyzed.
RESULTS: Findings revealed that measures of MRI volume, FDG-PET metabolic 
activity, and adaptive function added measurement precision beyond that provided 
by cognitive measures, particularly in the relatively mild range of disease 
severity. More specifically, MRI volume, and FDG-PET metabolic activity become 
compromised in the very mild range of severity, followed by cognitive 
performance and finally adaptive function.
CONCLUSION: Our statistically derived models of the AD pathological cascade are 
consistent with existing theoretical models.

The application of support vector machine classification (SVM) to combined 
information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and [F18]fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been shown to improve detection and 
differentiation of Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) and frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration. To validate this approach for the most frequent dementia syndrome 
AD, and to test its applicability to multicenter data, we randomly extracted 
FDG-PET and MRI data of 28 AD patients and 28 healthy control subjects from the 
database provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
compared them to data of 21 patients with AD and 13 control subjects from our 
own Leipzig cohort. SVM classification using combined volume-of-interest 
information from FDG-PET and MRI based on comprehensive quantitative 
meta-analyses investigating dementia syndromes revealed a higher discrimination 
accuracy in comparison to single modality classification. For the ADNI dataset 
accuracy rates of up to 88% and for the Leipzig cohort of up to 100% were 
obtained. Classifiers trained on the ADNI data discriminated the Leipzig cohorts 
with an accuracy of 91%. In conclusion, our results suggest SVM classification 
based on quantitative meta-analyses of multicenter data as a valid method for 
individual AD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining imaging information from MRI and 
FDG-PET might substantially improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition and MCI 
patients are at increased risk of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to evaluate the associations between polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs) and 1) time to AD progression from MCI, 2) changes in 
longitudinal cognitive impairment, and 3) biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid 
and imaging.
METHODS: We constructed PRS by using 40 independent non-APOE SNPs from 
well-replicated AD GWASs and tested its association with the progression time 
from MCI to AD by using 767 MCI patients from the ADNI study and 1373 patients 
from the NACC study. PRSs calculated with other methods were also computed.
RESULTS: We found that the PRS constructed with SNPs that reached genome-wide 
significance predicted the progression from MCI to AD (beta = 0.182, SE = 0.061, 
p = 0.003) after adjusting for the demographic and clinical variables. This 
association was replicated in the NACC dataset (beta = 0.094, SE = 0.037, 
p = 0.009). Further analyses revealed that PRS was associated with the increased 
ADAS-Cog11/ADAS-Cog13/ADASQ4 scores, tau/ptau levels, and cortical amyloid 
burdens (PiB-PET and AV45-PET), but decreased hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 
volumes (p < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of PRS on the 
increased risk of AD may be mediated by Aβ42 (beta = 0.056, SE = 0.026, 
p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PRS can be useful for the prediction of 
time to AD and other clinical changes after the diagnosis of MCI.

AIM: To identify the factors protecting Abeta-positive subjects with normal 
cognition (NC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from conversion to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: Subjects with MCI in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, with baseline data for neuropsychological tests, brain beta 
amyloid (Abeta), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), APOE genotyping, and 
18F-FDG-PET (FDG), were included for analysis.
RESULTS: Elevated brain amyloid was associated with a higher risk of conversion 
from MCI to AD (41.5%) relative to Abeta levels of <1.231 (5.5%) but was not 
associated with conversion from NC to AD (0.0 vs. 1.4%). In the multivariate Cox 
regression analyses, elevated Abeta increased the risk of AD, while higher 
whole-brain cerebral glucose metabolism (CGM) assessed by FDG decreased the risk 
of AD in subjects with the same amount of Abeta. Even in the patients with 
heavily elevated brain amyloid, those with FDG > 5.946 had a lower risk of AD. 
ApoE4 carrier status did not influence the protective effect.
CONCLUSION: Higher average CGM based on FDG modified the progression to AD, 
indicating a protective function. The results suggest that the inclusion of this 
CGM measured by FDG would enrich clinical trial design and that increasing CGM 
along with the use of anti-Abeta agents might be a potential prevention strategy 
for AD.

The joint analysis of brain atrophy measured with magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and hypometabolism measured with positron emission tomography with 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is of primary importance in developing models of 
pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of the current multimodal 
analyses in AD assume a local (spatially overlapping) relationship between MR 
and FDG-PET intensities. However, it is well known that atrophy and 
hypometabolism are prominent in different anatomical areas. The aim of this work 
is to describe the relationship between atrophy and hypometabolism by means of a 
data-driven statistical model of non-overlapping intensity correlations. For 
this purpose, FDG-PET and MRI signals are jointly analyzed through a 
computationally tractable formulation of partial least squares regression 
(PLSR). The PLSR model is estimated and validated on a large clinical cohort of 
1049 individuals from the ADNI dataset. Results show that the proposed non-local 
analysis outperforms classical local approaches in terms of predictive accuracy 
while providing a plausible description of disease dynamics: early AD is 
characterised by non-overlapping temporal atrophy and temporo-parietal 
hypometabolism, while the later disease stages show overlapping brain atrophy 
and hypometabolism spread in temporal, parietal and cortical areas.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether self-reported mild traumatic 
brain injury (mTBI) was associated with decreased AD-vulnerable cortical 
thickness, and to assess the relationship between AD-vulnerable cortical 
thickness and AD-related biomarker in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative subjects. We identified 45 self-reported mTBI subjects, who had 
structural MRI, 18F-AV45 PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data. Of them, eight 
subjects were normal; ten were preclinical AD; seventeen were MCI due to AD; ten 
were AD. Additional demographics-controlled 45 subjects were included. Cortical 
thickness of eight AD-vulnerable regions, mean AD-vulnerable cortical thickness, 
18F-AV45 PET mean amyloid SUVR, CSF Aβ42, CSF total tau (T-tau), and CSF 
phosphorylated tau (P-tau) were compared between mTBI and non-TBI groups. 
Correlational analysis was done to investigate the relationship between mean 
AD-vulnerable cortical thickness and mean amyloid SUVR, CSF Aβ42, CSF T-Tau, CSF 
P-Tau. Our study revealed that preclinical AD subjects with self-reported mTBI 
had smaller cortical thickness in mean and three AD-vulnerable cortical regions 
than non-TBI subjects (P<0.05). The mean AD-vulnerable cortical thickness was 
correlated with CSF T-tau (r=-0.81, P=0.001). There was no statistical 
difference in the comparison of normal, MCI due to AD, and AD groups. Our study 
indicated that among individuals with preclinical AD, but not normal, MCI due to 
AD and AD subjects, self-reported mTBI was associated with more decreased 
AD-vulnerable cortical thickness which was related to CSF tau pathology, 
suggesting the possible early involvement of tau pathology in the decreased 
AD-vulnerable cortical thickness of self-reported TBI subjects.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) levels of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Aβ1-42, t-tau, 
and p-tau) and 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 
hypometabolism in subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 
and specifically to determine which index of neurodegeneration was most 
frequently affected. The secondary objective was to determine the most 
frequently hypometabolic region in patients with a CSF AD signature (abnormal 
Aβ1-42 and abnormal p-tau). We included the 372 subjects (85 normal subjects, 
212 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 75 patients with AD) with a CSF 
biomarker dosage (Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau) and brain FDG-PET. The relationship 
between FDG-PET metabolism (in five regions of interest (ROI) known to be 
damaged in AD) and CSF t-tau and p-tau levels was studied as a function of CSF 
Aβ1-42 status. FDG-PET hypometabolism and CSF t-tau and p-tau levels were 
correlated only in patients with an abnormal CSF Aβ1-42 level (t-tau: 
R2 = 0.044, p = 0.001; p-tau: R2 = 0.02, p = 0.03). In the latter patients, CSF 
p-tau was the most frequently (p = 0.0001) abnormal neurodegeneration marker 
(p-tau: 92.8%; FDG-PET: 56.5%; CSF t-tau: 59.1%). Within the five ROI of FDG 
PET, the angular gyrus metabolism (R2 = 0.149; p = 0.0001) was selected as the 
most tightly associated with CSF AD signature. The relation between CSF markers 
of neurodegeneration (p-tau and t-tau) and brain hypometabolism (in FDG-PET) is 
conditioned by presence of amyloid abnormality. This finding supports the 
current physiopathological model of AD. P-tau is the most frequently impaired 
biomarker. Using FDG PET angular gyrus hypometabolism is the most sensitive to 
CSF-biomarker-defined AD.

OBJECTIVE: Both low and high body mass index (BMI) has been associated with 
cognitive impairment and dementia risk, including Alzheimer disease (AD). We 
examined the relationship of BMI with potential underlying biological substrates 
for cognitive impairment.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from participants enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with PET imaging using 
Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB, n = 101) or CSF analyses (n = 405) for β-amyloid 
peptide (Aβ) and total tau. We assessed the relationship of CSF biomarkers and 
global PiB uptake with BMI using linear regression controlling for age and sex. 
We also assessed BMI differences between those who were and were not considered 
biomarker positive. Finally, we assessed BMI change over 2 years in relationship 
to AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: No dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD groups were not 
different in age, education, or BMI. In the overall sample, CSF Aβ (β = 0.181, p 
< 0.001), tau (β = -0.179, p < 0.001), tau/Aβ ratio (β = -0.180, p < 0.001), and 
global PiB uptake (β = -0.272, p = 0.005) were associated with BMI, with markers 
of increased AD burden associated with lower BMI. Fewer overweight individuals 
had biomarker levels indicative of pathophysiology (p < 0.01). These 
relationships were strongest in the MCI and no dementia groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence and burden of in vivo biomarkers of cerebral amyloid 
and tau are associated with lower BMI in cognitively normal and MCI individuals. 
This supports previous findings of systemic change in the earliest phases of the 
disease. Further, MCI in those who are overweight may be more likely to result 
from heterogeneous pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence supports an important role of vascular risk in 
cognitive decline and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether vascular risk was associated with 
cognitive decline, cerebral hypometabolism, and clinical progression in 
cognitively intact elders.
METHODS: Vascular risk was assessed by the Framingham Heart Study general 
Cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score. The cross-sectional and 
longitudinal associations of FHS-CVD risk score with cognition and brain glucose 
metabolism were explored using multivariate linear regression and linear mixed 
effects models, respectively. The risk of clinical progression conversion was 
assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional 
hazard models.
RESULTS: A total of 491 cognitively intact elders were included from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Participants with high FHS-CVD 
risk scores had lower baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p = 0.009), 
executive function (EF) (p < 0.001), memory function (MEM) (p < 0.001) scores, 
and F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) uptake 
(p < 0.001) than those with low FHS-CVD risk scores. In longitudinal analyses, 
individuals with higher FHS-CVD risk scores had greater longitudinal declines in 
MMSE (p = 0.043), EF (p = 0.029) scores, and FDG-PET uptake (p = 0.035). 
Besides, individuals with a higher vascular risk had an increased risk of 
clinical progression (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated effects of vascular risk on cognitive 
decline, cerebral hypometabolism, and clinical progression. Early detection and 
management of vascular risk factors might be useful in the prevention of 
dementia.

INTRODUCTION: We analyzed the effects of the top 20 Alzheimer disease (AD) risk 
genes on gray-matter density (GMD) and metabolism.
METHODS: We ran stepwise linear regression analysis using posterior cingulate 
hypometabolism and medial temporal GMD as outcomes and all risk variants as 
predictors while controlling for age, gender, and APOE ε4 genotype. We explored 
the results in 3D using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8.
RESULTS: Significant predictors of brain GMD were SLC24A4/RIN3 in the pooled and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI); ZCWPW1 in the MCI; and ABCA7, EPHA1, and INPP5D 
in the AD groups. Significant predictors of hypometabolism were EPHA1 in the 
pooled, and SLC24A4/RIN3, NME8, and CD2AP in the normal control group.
DISCUSSION: Multiple variants showed associations with GMD and brain metabolism. 
For most genes, the effects were limited to specific stages of the cognitive 
continuum, indicating that the genetic influences on brain metabolism and GMD in 
AD are complex and stage dependent.

The brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have three 
classical pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, and 
neurodegeneration, including that of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. 
However the relationship between Aβ burden and basal forebrain degeneration has 
not been extensively studied. To investigate this association, basal forebrain 
volumes were determined from magnetic resonance images of controls, subjects 
with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients enrolled in the 
longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Australian 
Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) studies. In the AIBL cohort, these 
volumes were correlated within groups to neocortical gray matter retention of 
Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) from positron emission tomography images as a 
measure of Aβ load. The basal forebrain volumes of AD and aMCI subjects were 
significantly reduced compared to those of control subjects. Anterior basal 
forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in AD 
subjects and aMCI subjects with high Aβ burden, whereas posterior basal 
forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in 
control subjects with high Aβ burden. Therefore this study provides new evidence 
for a correlation between neocortical Aβ accumulation and basal forebrain 
degeneration. In addition, cluster analysis showed that subjects with a whole 
basal forebrain volume below a determined cut-off value had a 7 times higher 
risk of having a worse diagnosis within ~18 months.

Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its 
prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), has attracted more and 
more attention recently. So far, multiple biomarkers have been shown to be 
sensitive to the diagnosis of AD and MCI, i.e., structural MR imaging (MRI) for 
brain atrophy measurement, functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET) for hypometabolism 
quantification, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for quantification of specific 
proteins. However, most existing research focuses on only a single modality of 
biomarkers for diagnosis of AD and MCI, although recent studies have shown that 
different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of 
AD and MCI. In this paper, we propose to combine three modalities of biomarkers, 
i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers, to discriminate between AD (or MCI) and 
healthy controls, using a kernel combination method. Specifically, ADNI baseline 
MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 51AD patients, 99 MCI patients (including 43 MCI 
converters who had converted to AD within 18 months and 56 MCI non-converters 
who had not converted to AD within 18 months), and 52 healthy controls are used 
for development and validation of our proposed multimodal classification method. 
In particular, for each MR or FDG-PET image, 93 volumetric features are 
extracted from the 93 regions of interest (ROIs), automatically labeled by an 
atlas warping algorithm. For CSF biomarkers, their original values are directly 
used as features. Then, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to 
evaluate the classification accuracy, using a 10-fold cross-validation. As a 
result, for classifying AD from healthy controls, we achieve a classification 
accuracy of 93.2% (with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93.3%) when 
combining all three modalities of biomarkers, and only 86.5% when using even the 
best individual modality of biomarkers. Similarly, for classifying MCI from 
healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 76.4% (with a 
sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 66%) for our combined method, and only 
72% even using the best individual modality of biomarkers. Further analysis on 
MCI sensitivity of our combined method indicates that 91.5% of MCI converters 
and 73.4% of MCI non-converters are correctly classified. Moreover, we also 
evaluate the classification performance when employing a feature selection 
method to select the most discriminative MR and FDG-PET features. Again, our 
combined method shows considerably better performance, compared to the case of 
using an individual modality of biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Previous publications indicate that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) related 
cortical atrophy may develop in asymmetric patterns, with accentuation of the 
left hemisphere. Since fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) 
measurements of the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRgl) provide 
a sensitive and specific marker of neurodegenerative disease progression, we 
sought to investigate the longitudinal pattern of rCMRgl in amyloid-positive 
persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, hypothesizing 
asymmetric declines of cerebral glucose metabolism.
METHODS: Using florbetapir PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures to define 
amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity, 40 Aβ negative (Aβ-) cognitively unimpaired controls 
(CU; 76 ± 5y), 76 Aβ positive (Aβ+) persons with MCI (76 ± 7y) and 51 
Aβ + persons with probable AD dementia (75 ± 7y) from the AD Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) were included in this study with baseline and 2-year follow-up 
FDG PET scans. The degree of lateralization of longitudinal rCMRgl declines in 
subjects with Aβ + MCI and AD in comparison with Aβ- CU were statistically 
quantified via bootstrapped lateralization indices [(LI); range - 1 (right) to 1 
(left)].
RESULTS: Compared to Aβ- CU, Aβ + MCI patients showed marked left hemispheric 
lateralization (LI: 0.78). In contrast, modest right hemispheric lateralization 
(LI: -0.33) of rCMRgl declines was found in Aβ + persons with probable AD 
dementia. Additional comparisons of Aβ + groups (i.e. MCI and probable AD 
dementia) consequently indicated right hemispheric lateralization (LI: -0.79) of 
stronger rCMRgl declines in dementia stages of AD. For all comparisons, 
voxel-based analyses confirmed significant (pFWE<0.05) declines of rCMRgl within 
AD-typical brain regions. Analyses of cognitive data yielded predominant decline 
of memory functions in both MCI and dementia stages of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in early stages, AD may be characterized 
by a more lateralized pattern of left hemispheric rCMRgl declines. However, 
metabolic differences between hemispheres appear to diminish with further 
progression of the disease.

In this study we compared Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) positron emission 
tomography (PET) amyloid imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose PET for metabolism, and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for structure to predict conversion from 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia using data from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Numeric neuroimaging 
variables generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-funded 
laboratories for each neuroimaging modality along with apolipoprotein-E genotype 
(n = 29) were analyzed. Performance of these biomarkers for predicting 
conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia at 2 years was evaluated in 50 late 
amnestic MCI subjects, 20 of whom converted. Multivariate modeling found that 
among individual modalities, MRI had the highest predictive accuracy (67%) which 
increased by 9% to 76% when combined with PIB-PET, producing the highest 
accuracy among any biomarker combination. Individually, PIB-PET generated the 
best sensitivity, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET had the lowest. Among individual 
brain regions, the temporal cortex was found to be most predictive for MRI and 
PIB-PET.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common among military veterans and has been 
associated with an increased risk of dementia. It is unclear if this is due to 
increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other mechanisms. This case 
control study sought evidence for AD, as defined by the 2018 National Institute 
on Aging - Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) research framework, by measuring 
tau, β-amyloid, and glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) 
in veterans with service-related TBI. Seventy male Vietnam war veterans-40 with 
TBI (age 68.0 ± 2.5 years) and 30 controls (age 70.1 ± 5.3 years)-with no prior 
diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment underwent β-amyloid 
(18F-Florbetaben), tau (18F-Flortaucipir), and fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET. 
The TBI cohort included 15 participants with mild, 16 with moderate, and nine 
with severe injury. β-Amyloid level was calculated using the Centiloid (CL) 
method and tau was measured by standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using 
the cerebellar cortex as reference region. Analyses were adjusted for age and 
APOE-e4. The findings were validated in an independent cohort from the 
Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (DOD ADNI) 
study. There were no significant nor trending differences in β-amyloid or tau 
levels or 18F-FDG uptake between the TBI and control groups before and after 
controlling for covariates. The β-amyloid and tau findings were replicated in 
the DOD ADNI validation cohort and persisted when the Australian Imaging 
Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of aging-Veterans study (AIBL-VETS) and DOD ADNI 
cohorts were combined (114 TBI vs. 87 controls in total). In conclusion, no 
increase in the later life accumulation of the neuropathological markers of AD 
in veterans with a remote history of TBI was identified.

BACKGROUND: Tau aggregation demonstrates close associations with hypometabolism 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although differing pathophysiological processes may 
underlie their development.
OBJECTIVE: To establish whether tau deposition and glucose metabolism have 
different trajectories in AD progression and evaluate the utility of global 
measures of these pathological hallmarks in predicting cognitive deficits.
METHODS: 279 participants with amyloid-β (Aβ) status, and T1-weighted MRI scans, 
were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(http://adni.loni.usc.edu). We created the standard uptake value ratio images 
using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 for [18F]AV1451-PET (tau) and 
[18F]FDG-PET (glucose metabolism) scans. Voxel-wise group and single-subject 
level SPM analysis evaluated the relationship between global [18F]FDG-PET and 
[18F]AV1451-PET depending on the Aβ status. Linear models assessed whether tau 
deposition or glucose metabolism better predicted clinical progression.
RESULTS: There was a dissociation between global cerebral glucose hypometabolism 
and global tau load in amyloid-positive AD and amyloid-negative mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) (p > 0.05). Global hypometabolism was only associated with 
global cortical tau in amyloid-positive MCI. Voxel-level single subject tau load 
better predicted neuropsychological performance, Alzheimer's disease assessment 
scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) 13 score, and one-year change compared with regional 
and global hypometabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: A dissociation between tau pathology and glucose metabolism at a 
global level in AD could imply that other pathological processes influence 
glucose metabolism. Furthermore, as tau is a better predictor of clinical 
progression, these processes may have independent trajectories and require 
independent consideration in the context of therapeutic interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) population, we examined (1) cross-sectional relationships between amyloid 
deposition, hypometabolism, and cognition, and (2) associations between amyloid 
and hypometabolism measurements and longitudinal cognitive measurements.
METHODS: We examined associations between mean cortical florbetapir uptake, mean 
(18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) within a set of 
predefined regions, and Alzhiemer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) 
performance in 426 ADNI participants (126 normal, 162 early mild cognitive 
impairment [EMCI], 85 late MCI [LMCI], 53 Alzheimer disease [AD] patients). For 
a subset of these (76 normal, 81 LMCI) we determined whether florbetapir and 
FDG-PET were associated with retrospective decline in longitudinal ADAS-cog 
measurements.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of normal subjects, 43% of EMCI patients, 62% of 
LMCI patients, and 77% of AD patients were categorized as florbetapir positive. 
Florbetapir was negatively associated with concurrent FDG and ADAS-cog in both 
MCI groups. In longitudinal analyses, florbetapir-positive subjects in both 
normal and LMCI groups had greater ongoing ADAS-cog decline than those who were 
florbetapir negative. However, in normal subjects, florbetapir positivity was 
associated with greater ADAS-cog decline than FDG, whereas in LMCI, FDG 
positivity was associated with greater decline than florbetapir.
INTERPRETATION: Although both hypometabolism and β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition are 
detectable in normal subjects and all diagnostic groups, Aβ showed greater 
associations with cognitive decline in normal participants. In view of the 
minimal cognitive deterioration overall in this group, this suggests that 
amyloid deposition has an early and subclinical impact on cognition that 
precedes metabolic changes. At moderate and later stages of disease (LMCI/AD), 
hypometabolism becomes more pronounced and more closely linked to ongoing 
cognitive decline.

AIM: We investigated the performance of FDG PET using an automated procedure for 
discrimination between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls, and studied the 
influence of demographic and technical factors.
METHODS: FDG PET data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) [102 controls (76.0 +/- 4.9 years) and 89 AD patients (75.7 
+/- 7.6 years, MMSE 23.5 +/- 2.1) and the Network for Standardisation of 
Dementia Diagnosis (NEST-DD) [36 controls (62.2 +/- 5.0 years) and 237 AD 
patients (70.8 +/- 8.3 years, MMSE 20.9 +/- 4.4). The procedure created t-maps 
of abnormal voxels. The sum of t-values in predefined areas that are typically 
affected by AD (AD t-sum) provided a measure of scan abnormality associated with 
a preset threshold for discrimination between patients and controls.
RESULTS: AD patients had much higher AD t-sum scores compared to controls (p < 
0.01), which were significantly related to dementia severity (ADNI: r = -0.62, p 
< 0.01; NEST-DD: r = -0.59, p < 0.01). Early-onset AD patients had significantly 
higher AD t-sum scores than late-onset AD patients (p < 0.01). Differences 
between databases were mainly due to different age distributions. The predefined 
AD t-sum threshold yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 78% in ADNI 
and 78 and 94% in NEST-DD, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The automated FDG PET analysis procedure provided good 
discrimination power, and was most accurate for early-onset AD.

Previous studies demonstrated that plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) played 
important predictive roles in disease progression and neurodegeneration in the 
preclinical phase of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether plasma 
NFL has the same predictive roles in sporadic AD is still unclear. In this 
study, 243 cognitively normal (CN) participants from the ADNI database were 
divided into two subgroups (CN- and CN+) according to CSF Aβ or AV45-PET. 
Associations of baseline plasma NFL concentrations or rate of change in plasma 
NFL with longitudinal data on other biomarkers were tested by multivariate 
linear mixed effects models (LMEMs). Results showed that plasma NFL 
concentration and its rate of change were already abnormally high in the 
preclinical phase of AD. Plasma NFL was associated with three core AD-related 
biomarkers in preclinical phase. Baseline plasma NFL, but not its rate of 
change, played predictive roles in both cognitive decline (β = -0.0349, p = 
0.0274) and hippocampal atrophy (β = -0.0351, p = 0.0088), especially for 
preclinical AD participants. In summary, these results indicated that baseline 
plasma NFL, but not its rate of change, may be a valuable noninvasive tool to 
assess neurodegeneration and predict longitudinal disease progression in 
preclinical AD individuals.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) can effectively predict by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) of the brain, but current PET images 
still suffer from indistinct lesion features, low signal-to-noise ratios, and 
severe artefacts, resulting in poor prediction accuracy for patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and unclear lesion features. In this paper, an AD 
prediction algorithm based on group convolution and a joint loss function is 
proposed. First, a group convolutional backbone network based on ResNet18 is 
designed to extract lesion features from multiple channels, which makes the 
expression ability of the network improved to a great extent. Then, a hybrid 
attention mechanism is presented, which enables the network to focus on target 
regions and learn feature weights, so as to enhance the network's learning 
ability of the lesion regions that are relevant to disease diagnosis. Finally, a 
joint loss function, that avoids the overfitting phenomenon, increases the 
generalization of the model, and improves prediction accuracy by adding a 
regularization loss function to the conventional cross-entropy function, is 
proposed. Experiments conducted on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that the algorithm we proposed gives a prediction 
accuracy improvement of 2.4% over that of the current AD prediction algorithm, 
thus proving the effectiveness and availability of the new algorithm.

The aim of this study was to determine a pattern associated with longitudinal 
changes of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition during cognitively normal(CN) healthy 
aging. We used 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) PET images of the brains of 207 
cognitively normal subjects (CN1), obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to identify the healthy aging pattern and 76 
cognitively normal healthy subjects (CN2), obtained through the Xuanwu Hospital 
of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, to verify it. A voxel-based 
correlation analysis of standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) map image and age 
was conducted using the DPABI (Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging) 
software to identify the pattern. The sum of squares due to errors (SSE), 
R-square (R2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were calculated to assess 
the quality of curve fitting. Among them, R2 was proposed as the coherence 
coefficient, which was as an index to assess the correlation between SUVR value 
of the pattern and subjects' age. The pattern characterized by age-associated 
longitudinal changes of Aβ deposition was mainly distributed in the right middle 
and inferior temporal gyrus, the right temporal pole: middle temporal gyrus, the 
right inferior occipital gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus (triangular 
portion), and the right precentral gyrus. There were a significant positive 
correlation between the SUVR value of the pattern and age for each CN group 
(CN1: R2 = 0.120, p < 0.001 for quadratic model; CN2: R2 = 0.152, p = 0.002 for 
quadratic model). These findings suggest a pattern of changes in Aβ deposition 
that can be used to distinguish physiological changes from pathophysiological 
changes, constituting a new method for elucidating the neuropathological 
mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Psychometric tests predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because the definition of clinical 
AD relies on those same psychometric tests, the ability of these tests to 
identify underlying AD pathology remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree to which psychometric testing predicts 
molecular evidence of AD amyloid pathology, as indicated by cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ)1 - 42, in patients with MCI, as compared to neuroimaging 
biomarkers.
METHODS: We identified 408 MCI subjects with CSF Aβ levels, psychometric test 
data, FDG-PET scans, and acceptable volumetric MR scans from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used psychometric tests and imaging 
biomarkers in univariate and multivariate models to predict Aβ status.
RESULTS: The 30-min delayed recall score of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning 
Test was the best predictor of Aβ status among the psychometric tests, achieving 
an AUC of 0.67 ± 0.02 and odds ratio of 2.5 ± 0.4. FDG-PET was the best 
imaging-based biomarker (AUC 0.67 ± 0.03, OR 3.2 ± 1.2), followed by hippocampal 
volume (AUC 0.64 ± 0.02, OR 2.4 ± 0.3). A multivariate analysis based on the 
psychometric tests improved on the univariate predictors, achieving an AUC of 
0.68 ± 0.03 (OR 3.38 ± 1.2). Adding imaging biomarkers to the multivariate 
analysis did not improve the AUC.
CONCLUSION: Psychometric tests perform as well as imaging biomarkers to predict 
presence of molecular markers of AD pathology in MCI patients and should be 
considered in the determination of the likelihood that MCI is due to AD.

Alzheimer's Disease-resemblance atrophy index (AD-RAI) is an MRI-based machine 
learning derived biomarker that was developed to reflect the characteristic 
brain atrophy associated with AD. Recent study showed that AD-RAI (≥0.5) had the 
best performance in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
to dementia and from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to MCI. We aimed to validate 
the performance of AD-RAI in detecting preclinical and prodromal AD. We 
recruited 128 subjects (MCI=50, CU=78) from two cohorts: CU-SEEDS and ADNI. 
Amyloid (A+) and tau (T+) status were confirmed by PET (11C-PIB, 18F-T807) or 
CSF analysis. We investigated the performance of AD-RAI in detecting preclinical 
and prodromal AD (i.e. A+T+) among MCI and CU subjects and compared its 
performance with that of hippocampal measures. AD-RAI achieved the best metrics 
among all subjects (sensitivity 0.74, specificity 0.91, accuracy 85.94%) and 
among MCI subjects (sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.81, accuracy 86.00%) in 
detecting A+T+ subjects over other measures. Among CU subjects, AD-RAI yielded 
the best specificity (0.95) and accuracy (85.90%) over other measures, while 
hippocampal volume achieved a higher sensitivity (0.73) than AD-RAI (0.47) in 
detecting preclinical AD. These results showed the potential of AD-RAI in the 
detection of early AD, in particular at the prodromal stage.

The research on staging of pre-symptomatic and prodromal phase of neurological 
disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD), is essential for prevention of 
dementia. New strategies for AD staging with a focus on early detection, are 
demanded to optimize potential efficacy of disease-modifying therapies that can 
halt or slow the disease progression. Recently, neuroimaging are increasingly 
used as additional research-based markers to detect AD onset and predict 
conversion of MCI and normal control (NC) to AD. Researchers have proposed a 
variety of neuroimaging biomarkers to characterize the patterns of the pathology 
of AD and MCI, and suggested that multi-view neuroimaging biomarkers could lead 
to better performance than single-view biomarkers in AD staging. However, it is 
still unclear what leads to such synergy and how to preserve or maximize. In an 
attempt to answer these questions, we proposed a cross-view pattern analysis 
framework for investigating the synergy between different neuroimaging 
biomarkers. We quantitatively analyzed nine types of biomarkers derived from 
FDG-PET and T1-MRI, and evaluated their performance in a task of classifying AD, 
MCI, and NC subjects obtained from the ADNI baseline cohort. The experiment 
results showed that these biomarkers could depict the pathology of AD from 
different perspectives, and output distinct patterns that are significantly 
associated with the disease progression. Most importantly, we found that these 
features could be separated into clusters, each depicting a particular aspect; 
and the inter-cluster features could always achieve better performance than the 
intra-cluster features in AD staging.

A family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases one's risk of developing 
late-onset AD (LOAD), and a maternal family history of LOAD influences risk more 
than a paternal family history. Accumulating evidence suggests that a family 
history of dementia associates with AD-typical biomarker changes. We analyzed 
cross-sectional data from non-demented, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
LOAD participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with 
PET imaging using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB, n = 99) and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) analysis (n = 403) for amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and total tau. We assessed 
the relationship of CSF and PiB biomarkers and family history of dementia, as 
well as parent gender effects. In the larger analysis of CSF biomarkers, we 
assessed diagnosis groups individually. In the overall sample, CSF Aβ, tau/Aβ 
ratio, and global PiB uptake were significantly different between family history 
positive and negative groups, with markers of increased AD burden associated 
with a positive maternal family history of dementia. Moreover, a maternal family 
history of dementia was associated with significantly greater PiB Aβ load in the 
brain in the parietal cortex, precuneus, and sensorimotor cortex. Individuals 
with MCI positive for a maternal family history of dementia had significantly 
more markers of AD pathophysiology than individuals with no family history of 
dementia. A family history of dementia is associated with AD-typical biomarker 
changes. These biomarker associations are most robust in individuals with a 
maternal family history, suggesting that a maternally inherited factor 
influences AD risk.

BACKGROUND: A corollary of the reserve hypothesis is that what is regarded as 
pathological cortical metabolism in patients might vary according to education.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the incremental diagnostic value 
of education-adjusted over unadjusted thresholds on the diagnostic accuracy of 
FDG-PET as a biomarker for Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: We compared cortical metabolism in 90 healthy controls and 181 AD 
patients from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The 
AUC of the ROC curve did not differ significantly between the whole group and 
the higher-education patients or the lower-education subjects.
RESULTS: The threshold of wMetaROI values providing 80% sensitivity was lower in 
higher-education patients and higher in the lower-education patients, compared 
to the standard threshold derived over the whole AD collective, without, 
however, significant changes in sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: These data show that education, as a proxy of reserve, is not a 
major confounder in the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET in AD and the adoption of 
education-adjusted thresholds is not required in daily practice.

Differences in brain metabolism as measured by FDG-PET in prodromal and early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been consistently observed, with a characteristic 
parietotemporal hypometabolic pattern. However, exploration of brain metabolic 
correlates of more nuanced measures of cognitive function has been rare, 
particularly in larger samples. We analyzed the relationship between resting 
brain metabolism and memory and executive functioning within diagnostic group on 
a voxel-wise basis in 86 people with AD, 185 people with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and 86 healthy controls (HC) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found positive associations within AD and MCI 
but not in HC. For MCI and AD, impaired executive functioning was associated 
with reduced parietotemporal metabolism, suggesting a pattern consistent with 
known AD-related hypometabolism. These associations suggest that decreased 
metabolic activity in the parietal and temporal lobes may underlie the executive 
function deficits in AD and MCI. For memory, hypometabolism in similar regions 
of the parietal and temporal lobes were significantly associated with reduced 
performance in the MCI group. However, for the AD group, memory performance was 
significantly associated with metabolism in frontal and orbitofrontal areas, 
suggesting the possibility of compensatory metabolic activity in these areas. 
Overall, the associations between brain metabolism and cognition in this study 
suggest the importance of parietal and temporal lobar regions in memory and 
executive function in the early stages of disease and an increased importance of 
frontal regions for memory with increasing impairment.

PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
reveals altered cerebral metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Previous metabolic connectome 
analyses derive from groups of patients but do not support the prediction of an 
individual's risk of conversion from present MCI to AD. We now present an 
individual metabolic connectome method, namely the Kullback-Leibler Divergence 
Similarity Estimation (KLSE), to characterize brain-wide metabolic networks that 
predict an individual's risk of conversion from MCI to AD.
METHODS: FDG-PET data consisting of 50 healthy controls, 332 patients with 
stable MCI, 178 MCI patients progressing to AD, and 50 AD patients were 
recruited from ADNI database. Each individual's metabolic brain network was 
ascertained using the KLSE method. We compared intra- and intergroup similarity 
and difference between the KLSE matrix and group-level matrix, and then 
evaluated the network stability and inter-individual variation of KLSE. The 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Harrell's concordance index 
(C-index) were employed to assess the prediction performance of KLSE and other 
clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: The KLSE method captures more pathological connectivity in the parietal 
and temporal lobes relative to the typical group-level method, and yields 
detailed individual information, while possessing greater stability of network 
organization (within-group similarity coefficient, 0.789 for sMCI and 0.731 for 
pMCI). Metabolic connectome expression was a superior predictor of conversion 
than were other clinical assessments (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.55; 95% CI, 
2.77-4.55; P < 0.001). The predictive performance improved further upon 
combining clinical variables in the Cox model, i.e., C-indices 0.728 (clinical), 
0.730 (group-level pattern model), 0.750 (imaging connectome), and 0.794 (the 
combined model).
CONCLUSION: The KLSE indicator identifies abnormal brain networks predicting an 
individual's risk of conversion from MCI to AD, thus potentially constituting a 
clinically applicable imaging biomarker.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer' disease (AD) is characterized by increase of cortical 
amyloid deposition in prodromal stage and subsequent decrease of cerebral 
glucose metabolism as disease progresses. The present study introduces the 
voxel-wise metabolism to amyloid deposits ratio (MAR) image and to evaluate its 
reliability for the diagnosis of AD.
METHODS: Consecutive one-hundred and forty-three subjects with AD and 181 normal 
subjects who underwent both 18F-FDG PET and 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) PET at 
baseline were included to this study from the database of Alzheimer's disease 
neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). After normalizing to a standard stereotactic 
space, the MAR image was created by dividing each FDG-PET image by corresponding 
AV-45 PET image using with voxel-wise inter-image computation. We examined voxel 
wise comparison in the MAR images between AD subjects and normal subjects and 
compared the diagnostic performances between the MAR image and FDG-PET and AV-45 
image.
RESULTS: In the voxel wise comparison, the MAR images of AD subjects exhibited 
severe and extensive decrease compared with normal subjects in the affected 
region in both FDG-PET and AV-45, especially in the precuneus /posterior 
cingulate. The highest t-value was equivalent to FDG-PET and the voxel extent 
was much greater than the other images. In the ROI analysis, the diagnostic 
accuracies were 82.6% (sensitivity: 86.7%, specificity: 79.5%), 80.7% 
(sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 83.4%), and 78.8% (sensitivity: 75.2%, 
specificity: 81.5%) for the MAR image, FDG-PET, and AV-45, respectively. AUC for 
the MAR image was 0.904 (95%CI: 0.867-0.942), and was larger than those for 
FDG-PET (AUC: 0.884, 95%CI: 0.843-0.926), and AV-45 (AUC: 0.847, 95%CI: 
0.798-0.897).
CONCLUSION: MAR image reflected not only amyloid deposition but the cerebral 
glucose metabolisms and successfully classified the subjects with AD. These data 
suggest that the MAR image might be a more proper appropriate diagnostic marker 
for AD reflecting cerebral metabolisms and amyloid deposition.

β-Amyloid pathology is elevated in ~30% of cognitively normal people over 65, 
and is associated with accelerated neurodegeneration in the pre-clinical stages 
of Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings reveal that brain iron might also act to 
propel neurodegeneration in people with underlying amyloid pathology. Here, 
repeated PET scans of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were used as a biomarker for 
brain hypometabolism and a downstream biomarker of neurodegeneration to 
investigate whether levels of ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; a 
reporter of brain iron load) are associated with prodromal disease progression 
of people with high β-amyloid pathology determined by established cut-off values 
in CSF t-tau/Aβ42 ratio. Nineteen cognitively normal participants with low 
t-tau/Aβ42, and 71 participants with high t-tau/Aβ42 who were cognitively normal 
or had mild cognitive impairment were included as participants from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. These subjects had 
repeated FDG-PET scans at 6-month intervals for 2 years, and yearly intervals 
for up to a further 3 years. In mixed-effects linear models of FDG signal, 
baseline CSF ferritin was associated with an accelerated decline in FDG PET in 
high t-tau/Aβ42 participants (β[SE] = -0.066 [0.017]; P = .0002), but not in 
people with low t-tau/Aβ42 (-0.029 [0.049]; P = .554). These data implicate iron 
as a contributing factor to neurodegeneration associated with β-amyloid 
pathology, and highlight CSF ferritin as a complementary prognostic biomarker to 
the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio that predicts near-term risk for disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative 
diseases that causes problems related to brain function. To some extent it is 
understood on a molecular level how AD arises, however there are a lack of 
biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis. Two popular methods to identify 
AD-related biomarkers use genetics and neuroimaging. Genes and neuroimaging 
phenotypes have provided some insights as to the potential for AD biomarkers. 
While the field of imaging-genomics has identified genetic features associated 
with structural and functional neuroimaging phenotypes, it remains unclear how 
variants that affect splicing could be important for understanding the genetic 
etiology of AD.
METHODS: In this study, rare variants (minor allele frequency < 0.01) in 
splicing regulatory element (SRE) loci from whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, were used to identify 
genes that are associated with global brain cortical glucose metabolism in AD 
measured by FDG PET-scans. Gene-based associated analyses of rare variants were 
performed using the program BioBin and the optimal Sequence Kernel Association 
Test (SKAT-O).
RESULTS: The gene, EXOC3L4, was identified as significantly associated with 
global cortical glucose metabolism (FDR (false discovery rate) corrected 
p < 0.05) using SRE coding variants only. Three loci that may affect splicing 
within EXOC3L4 contribute to the association.
CONCLUSION: Based on sequence homology, EXOC3L4 is likely a part of the exocyst 
complex. Our results suggest the possibility that variants which affect proper 
splicing of EXOC3L4 via SREs may impact vesicle transport, giving rise to AD 
related phenotypes. Overall, by utilizing WGS and functional neuroimaging we 
have identified a gene significantly associated with an AD related 
endophenotype, potentially through a mechanism that involves splicing.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder that often 
occurs in people over 65 years old. As advanced AD is difficult to manage, 
accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed 
effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning 
methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are 
affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a 
deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is 
less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(FDG-PET/CT).
RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 
86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, 
and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive 
(NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological 
changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered 
statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets 
for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance 
comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically 
significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD 
classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC 
in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. 
Furthermore, we showed that there were no significant differences in performance 
using statistical analysis.

Deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain is one of the two main pathological 
hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET) is a neuroimaging tool that selectively detects in vivo amyloid deposition 
in the brain and is a reliable endophenotype for AD that complements 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers with regional information. We measured in vivo 
amyloid deposition in the brains of ~1000 subjects from three collaborative AD 
centers and ADNI using 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-PET imaging 
followed by meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, first to our 
knowledge for PiB-PET, to identify novel genetic loci for this endophenotype. 
The APOE region showed the most significant association where several SNPs 
surpassed the genome-wide significant threshold, with APOE*4 being most 
significant (P-meta = 9.09E-30; β = 0.18). Interestingly, after conditioning on 
APOE*4, 14 SNPs remained significant at P < 0.05 in the APOE region that were 
not in linkage disequilibrium with APOE*4. Outside the APOE region, the 
meta-analysis revealed 15 non-APOE loci with P < 1E-05 on nine chromosomes, with 
two most significant SNPs on chromosomes 8 (P-meta = 4.87E-07) and 3 
(P-meta = 9.69E-07). Functional analyses of these SNPs indicate their potential 
relevance with AD pathogenesis. Top 15 non-APOE SNPs along with APOE*4 explained 
25-35% of the amyloid variance in different datasets, of which 14-17% was 
explained by APOE*4 alone. In conclusion, we have identified novel signals in 
APOE and non-APOE regions that affect amyloid deposition in the brain. Our data 
also highlights the presence of yet to be discovered variants that may be 
responsible for the unexplained genetic variance of amyloid deposition.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research has shown that elevated blood 
C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with increased Alzheimer disease (AD) 
risk only in APOE ε4 allele carriers; the objective of this study was to examine 
the interactive effects of plasma CRP and APOE genotype on cognition and AD 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study 
were analyzed, including APOE genotype; plasma CRP concentrations; diagnostic 
status (i.e., mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to AD); Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia Staging 
Instrument scores; CSF concentrations of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42), total tau 
(t-Tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau); and amyloid (AV45) PET imaging. 
Multivariable regression analyses tested the associations between plasma CRP and 
APOE on cognitive and biomarker outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 566 ADNI participants, 274 (48.4%) had no, 222 (39.2%) had 1, and 
70 (12.4%) had 2 APOE ε4 alleles. Among only participants who had 2 APOE ε4 
alleles, elevated CRP was associated with lower MMSE score at baseline (β [95% 
confidence interval] -0.52 [-1.01, -0.12]) and 12-month follow-up (β -1.09 
[-1.88, -0.17]) after adjustment for sex, age, and education. The interaction of 
2 APOE ε4 alleles and elevated plasma CRP was associated with increased CSF 
levels of t-Tau (β = 11.21, SE 3.37, p < 0.001) and p-Tau (β = +2.74, SE 1.14, p 
< 0.01). Among those who had no APOE ε4 alleles, elevated CRP was associated 
with decreased CSF t-Tau and p-Tau. These effects were stronger at the 12-month 
follow-up.
DISCUSSION: CRP released during peripheral inflammation could be a mediator in 
APOE ε4-related AD neurodegeneration and serve as a drug target for AD.

Selecting a set of relevant markers to predict conversion from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a challenging task given 
the wealth of regional pathologic information that can be extracted from 
multimodal imaging data. Here, we used regularized regression approaches with an 
elastic net penalty for best subset selection of multiregional information from 
AV45-PET, FDG-PET and volumetric MRI data to predict conversion from MCI to AD. 
The study sample consisted of 127 MCI subjects from ADNI-2 who had a clinical 
follow-up between 6 and 31 months. Additional analyses assessed the effect of 
partial volume correction on predictive performance of AV45- and FDG-PET data. 
Predictor variables were highly collinear within and across imaging modalities. 
Penalized Cox regression yielded more parsimonious prediction models compared to 
unpenalized Cox regression. Within single modalities, time to conversion was 
best predicted by increased AV45-PET signal in posterior medial and lateral 
cortical regions, decreased FDG-PET signal in medial temporal and temporobasal 
regions, and reduced gray matter volume in medial, basal, and lateral temporal 
regions. Logistic regression models reached up to 72% cross-validated accuracy 
for prediction of conversion status, which was comparable to cross-validated 
accuracy of non-linear support vector machine classification. Regularized 
regression outperformed unpenalized stepwise regression when number of 
parameters approached or exceeded the number of training cases. Partial volume 
correction had a negative effect on the predictive performance of AV45-PET, but 
slightly improved the predictive value of FDG-PET data. Penalized regression 
yielded more parsimonious models than unpenalized stepwise regression for the 
integration of multiregional and multimodal imaging information. The advantage 
of penalized regression was particularly strong with a high number of collinear 
predictors.

PURPOSE: Emerging studies have suggested that tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that 
cerebral glucose hypometabolism is a key feature of AD. However, the association 
of CSF TNF-α levels with changes in cerebral glucose metabolism has not been 
studied among non-demented older people.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: At baseline, there were a total of 214 non-demented older 
people from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We 
examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSF TNF-α with 
global cognition (as assessed by mini-mental state examination), verbal memory 
(as assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-total learning score), and 
cerebral glucose metabolism (as measured by FDF-PET). Linear mixed-effects 
models were used to examine the longitudinal association of CSF TNF- α with 
change in each outcome over time with adjustment of age, educational level, 
gender, and APOE4 status.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, CSF TNF-α was negatively associated with 
MMSE scores, but not verbal memory or FDG-PET. In the longitudinal study, higher 
CSF TNF- α at baseline was associated with a faster decline in cerebral glucose 
metabolism, but not MMSE scores or RAVLT total learning scores.
CONCLUSION: Higher CSF TNF-α levels were associated with a steeper decline in 
cerebral glucose metabolism among non-demented older people.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The hippocampus is a widely recognized area of early 
change in AD, yet voxelwise analyses of FDG-PET activity differences between AD 
and CN controls have consistently failed to identify hippocampal hypometabolism. 
In this article, we propose a high-dimensional PET-specific analysis framework 
to determine whether important hippocampal metabolic FDG-PET activity 
differences between patients with AD and CN subjects are embedded in the 
Jacobian information generated during spatial normalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting FDG-PET data were obtained from 102 CN and 92 
participants with AD from the ADNI data base. A PET-study-specific template was 
constructed using symmetric diffeomorphic registration. Spatially normalized raw 
FDG maps, Jacobian determinant maps, and modulated maps were generated for all 
subjects. Statistical parametric mapping and tensor-based morphometry were 
performed, comparing patients with AD with CN subjects.
RESULTS: Whole-brain spatially normalized raw FDG maps demonstrated robust 
hypometabolism in cingulate gyrus and bilateral parietal areas. No hippocampal 
differences were present, except on ROI-based analyses with a hippocampal mask. 
Whole-brain modulated maps demonstrated robust bilateral hippocampal 
hypometabolism, and some hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate. Tensor-based 
morphometry demonstrated robust hippocampal differences only.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that hippocampal metabolic differences 
are embedded in the Jacobian information from the spatial normalization 
procedure. We introduce a voxelwise PET-specific analysis framework based on the 
use of a PET-population-specific template, high-dimensional symmetric 
diffeomorphic normalization, and the use of Jacobian information, which can 
provide substantially increased statistical power and an order of magnitude 
decrease in imaging costs.

Conventional brain connectivity analysis is typically based on the assessment of 
interregional correlations. Given that correlation coefficients are derived from 
both covariance and variance, group differences in covariance may be obscured by 
differences in the variance terms. To facilitate a comprehensive assessment of 
connectivity, we propose a unified statistical framework that interrogates the 
individual terms of the correlation coefficient. We have evaluated the utility 
of this method for metabolic connectivity analysis using 
[18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. As an illustrative 
example of the utility of this approach, we examined metabolic connectivity in 
angular gyrus and precuneus seed regions of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
subjects with low and high β-amyloid burdens. This new multivariate method 
allowed us to identify alterations in the metabolic connectome, which would not 
have been detected using classic seed-based correlation analysis. Ultimately, 
this novel approach should be extensible to brain network analysis and broadly 
applicable to other imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI).

Although beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are a primary diagnostic criterion for 
Alzheimer's disease, this pathology is commonly observed in the brains of 
non-demented older individuals. To explore the importance of this pathology in 
the absence of dementia, we compared levels of amyloid deposition (via 
'Pittsburgh Compound-B' (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging) to 
hippocampus volume (HV) and episodic memory (EM) in three groups: (i) normal 
controls (NC) from the Berkeley Aging Cohort (BAC NC, n = 20); (ii) normal 
controls (NC) from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI NC, n = 
17); and (iii) PIB+ mild cognitive impairment subjects from the ADNI (ADNI PIB+ 
MCI, n = 39). Age, gender and education were controlled for in each statistical 
model, and HV was adjusted for intracranial volume (aHV). In BAC NC, elevated 
PIB uptake was significantly associated with smaller aHV (P = 0.0016) and worse 
EM (P = 0.0086). Within ADNI NC, elevated PIB uptake was significantly 
associated with smaller aHV (P = 0.047) but not EM (P = 0.60); within ADNI PIB+ 
MCI, elevated PIB uptake was significantly associated with both smaller aHV (P = 
0.00070) and worse EM (P = 0.046). To further understand these relationships, a 
recursive regression procedure was conducted within all ADNI NC and PIB+ MCI 
subjects (n = 56) to test the hypothesis that HV mediates the relationship 
between Abeta and EM. Significant correlations were found between PIB index and 
EM (P = 0.0044), PIB index and aHV (P < 0.0001), as well as between aHV and EM 
(P < 0.0001). When both aHV and PIB were included in the same model to predict 
EM, aHV remained significant (P = 0.0015) whereas PIB index was no longer 
significantly associated with EM (P = 0.50). These results are consistent with a 
model in which Abeta deposition, hippocampal atrophy, and EM occur sequentially 
in elderly subjects, with Abeta deposition as the primary event in this cascade. 
This pattern suggests that declining EM in older individuals may be caused by 
Abeta-induced hippocampus atrophy.

11C-PIB PET image analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis using weighted voting 
ensembles.

Wenjun Wu, Venugopalan J, Wang MD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death and dementia 
worldwide. Early diagnosis confers many benefits, including improved care and 
access to effective treatment. However, it is still a medical challenge due to 
the lack of an efficient and inexpensive way to assess cognitive function [1]. 
Although research on data from Neuroimaging and Brain Initiative and the 
advancement in data analytics has greatly enhanced our understanding of the 
underlying disease process, there is still a lack of complete knowledge 
regarding the indicative biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. Recently, computer 
aided diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and AD with functional brain images 
using machine learning methods has become popular. However, the prediction 
accuracy remains unoptimistic, with prediction accuracy ranging from 60% to 88% 
[2,3,6]. Among them, support vector machine is the most popular classifier. 
However, because of the relatively small sample size and the amount of noise in 
functional brain imaging data, a single classifier cannot achieve high 
classification performance. Instead of using a global classifier, in this work, 
we aim to improve AD prediction accuracy by combining three different 
classifiers using weighted and unweighted schemes. We rank image-derived 
features according to their importance to the classification performance and 
show that the top ranked features are localized in the brain areas which have 
been found to associate with the progression of AD. We test the proposed 
approach on 11C-PIB PET scans from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database and demonstrated that the weighted ensemble models 
outperformed individual models of K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Neural 
Nets with overall cross validation accuracy of 86.1% ± 8.34%, specificity of 
90.6% ± 12.9% and test accuracy of 80.9% and specificity 85.76% in 
classification of AD, mild cognitive impairment and healthy elder adults.

Recently, multi-task based feature selection methods have been used in 
multi-modality based classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its 
prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, in traditional 
multi-task feature selection methods, some useful discriminative information 
among subjects is usually not well mined for further improving the subsequent 
classification performance. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a 
discriminative multi-task feature selection method to select the most 
discriminative features for multi-modality based classification of AD/MCI. 
Specifically, for each modality, we train a linear regression model using the 
corresponding modality of data, and further enforce the group-sparsity 
regularization on weights of those regression models for joint selection of 
common features across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we propose a 
discriminative regularization term based on the intra-class and inter-class 
Laplacian matrices to better use the discriminative information among subjects. 
To evaluate our proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on 202 
subjects, including 51 AD patients, 99 MCI patients, and 52 healthy controls 
(HC), from the baseline MRI and FDG-PET image data of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The experimental results show that our proposed 
method not only improves the classification performance, but also has potential 
to discover the disease-related biomarkers useful for diagnosis of disease, 
along with the comparison to several state-of-the-art methods for multi-modality 
based AD/MCI classification.

OBJECTIVE: To identify brain atrophy from structural-MRI and cerebral blood 
flow(CBF) patterns from arterial spin labeling perfusion-MRI that are best 
predictors of the Aβ-burden, measured as composite 18F-AV45-PET uptake, in 
individuals with early mild cognitive impairment(MCI). Furthermore, to assess 
the relative importance of imaging modalities in classification of Aβ+/Aβ- early 
mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Sixty-seven ADNI-GO/2 participants with early-MCI were included. 
Voxel-wise anatomical shape variation measures were computed by estimating the 
initial diffeomorphic mapping momenta from an unbiased control template. CBF 
measures normalized to average motor cortex CBF were mapped onto the template 
space. Using partial least squares regression, we identified the structural and 
CBF signatures of Aβ after accounting for normal cofounding effects of age, sex, 
and education.
RESULTS: 18F-AV45-positive early-MCIs could be identified with 83% 
classification accuracy, 87% positive predictive value, and 84% negative 
predictive value by multidisciplinary classifiers combining demographics data, 
ApoE ε4-genotype, and a multimodal MRI-based Aβ score.
INTERPRETATION: Multimodal-MRI can be used to predict the amyloid status of 
early-MCI individuals. MRI is a very attractive candidate for the identification 
of inexpensive and non-invasive surrogate biomarkers of Aβ deposition. Our 
approach is expected to have value for the identification of individuals likely 
to be Aβ+ in circumstances where cost or logistical problems prevent Aβ 
detection using cerebrospinal fluid analysis or Aβ-PET. This can also be used in 
clinical settings and clinical trials, aiding subject recruitment and evaluation 
of treatment efficacy. Imputation of the Aβ-positivity status could also 
complement Aβ-PET by identifying individuals who would benefit the most from 
this assessment.

Mild cognitive Impairment (MCI) is notoriously heterogenous in terms of clinical 
presentation, neuroimaging correlates, and subsequent progression. Predicting 
who will progress to dementia, which type of dementia, and over what timeframe 
is challenging. Previous work has attempted to identify MCI subtypes using 
neuropsychological measures in an effort to address this challenge; however, 
there is no consensus on approach, which may account for some of the 
variability. Using a hierarchical community detection approach, we examined 
cognitive subtypes within an MCI sample (from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI] study). We then examined whether these subtypes 
were related to biomarkers (e.g., cortical volumes, fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) hypometabolism) or clinical 
progression. We identified five communities (i.e., cognitive subtypes) within 
the MCI sample: 1) predominantly memory impairment, 2) predominantly language 
impairment, 3) cognitively normal, 4) multidomain, with notable executive 
dysfunction, 5) multidomain, with notable processing speed impairment. Community 
membership was significantly associated with 1) cortical volume in the 
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fusiform cortex; 2) FDG PET hypometabolism 
in the posterior cingulate, angular gyrus, and inferior/middle temporal gyrus; 
and 3) conversion to dementia at follow up. Overall, community detection as an 
approach appears a viable method for identifying unique cognitive subtypes in a 
neurodegenerative sample that were linked to several meaningful biomarkers and 
modestly with progression at one year follow up.

BACKGROUND: This is a progress report of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) positron emission tomography (PET) Core.
METHODS: The Core has supervised the acquisition, quality control, and analysis 
of longitudinal [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) data in approximately 
half of the ADNI cohort. In an "add on" study, approximately 100 subjects also 
underwent scanning with [(11)C] Pittsburgh compound B PET for amyloid imaging. 
The Core developed quality control procedures and standardized image acquisition 
by developing an imaging protocol that has been widely adopted in academic and 
pharmaceutical industry studies. Data processing provides users with scans that 
have identical orientation and resolution characteristics despite acquisition on 
multiple scanner models. The Core labs have used many different approaches to 
characterize differences between subject groups (Alzheimer's disease, mild 
cognitive impairment, controls), to examine longitudinal change over time in 
glucose metabolism and amyloid deposition, and to assess the use of FDG-PET as a 
potential outcome measure in clinical trials.
RESULTS: ADNI data indicate that FDG-PET increases statistical power over 
traditional cognitive measures, might aid subject selection, and could 
substantially reduce the sample size in a clinical trial. Pittsburgh compound B 
PET data showed expected group differences, and identified subjects with 
significant annual increases in amyloid load across the subject groups. The next 
activities of the PET core in ADNI will entail developing standardized protocols 
for amyloid imaging using the [(18)F]-labeled amyloid imaging agent AV45, which 
can be delivered to virtually all ADNI sites.
CONCLUSIONS: ADNI has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of multicenter 
PET studies and is helping to clarify the role of biomarkers in the study of 
aging and dementia.

The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, e.g., 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential for timely treatment or possible 
intervention to slow down AD progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information 
for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, information fusion strategies with 
multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from 
structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most 
existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do 
not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In 
this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method 
with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity 
is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random 
forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple 
modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample 
similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective 
function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the 
multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features 
selected from different models for final classification. The experimental 
results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the 
proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art 
multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area 
under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI 
converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets. 
Therefore, the proposed model not only outperforms the traditional method in 
terms of AD/MCI classification, but also discovers the characteristics 
associated with the disease, demonstrating its promise for improving 
disease-related mechanistic understanding.

The physiological basis of resilience to age-associated and AD-typical 
neurodegenerative pathology is still not well understood. So far, the 
established resilience factor intelligence has been shown to be associated with 
white matter network global efficiency, a key constituent of which are highly 
connected hubs. However, hub properties have also been shown to be impaired in 
AD. Individual predisposition or vulnerability of hub properties may thus 
modulate the impact of pathology on cognitive outcome and form part of the 
physiological basis of resilience. 85 cognitively normal elderly subjects and 
patients with MCI with DWI, MRI and AV45-PET scans were included from ADNI. We 
reconstructed the global WM networks in each subject and characterized 
hub-properties of GM regions using graph theory by calculating regional 
betweenness centrality. Subsequently, we investigated whether regional GM volume 
(GMV) and structural WM connectivity (WMC) of more hub-like regions was more 
associated with resilience, quantified as cognitive performance independent of 
amyloid burden, tau and WM lesions. Subjects with higher resilience showed 
higher increased regional GMV and WMC in more hub-like compared to less hub-like 
GM-regions. Additionally, this association was in some instances further 
increased at elevated amounts of brain pathology. Higher GMV and WMC of more 
hub-like regions may contribute more to resilience compared to less hub-like 
regions, reflecting their increased importance to brain network efficiency, and 
may thus form part of the neurophysiological basis of resilience. Future studies 
should investigate the factors leading to higher GMV and WMC of hubs in 
non-demented elderly with higher resilience.

Late life depression (LLD) even in subsyndromal stages shows high conversion 
rates from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results 
of [(18)F]-fluorodesoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography (FDG-PET) were 
inconsistent in LLD patients, whereas atrophy was repeatedly described. 
Therefore, we set out to investigate FDG metabolism and the effect of atrophy 
correction (PVEC) in geriatric CN patients with depressive symptoms. 21 CN 
subjects with positive item for the depression category (DEP) in the 
Neuropsychiatric-Inventory-Questionnaire and 29 CN subjects with an absent 
depression item (NON-DEP) were selected from the ADNI cohort. FDG-PETs were 
analyzed in individual PET space using volumes-of-interest (VOI) and 
statistical-parametric-mapping (SPM) approaches. VOI- and MRI-based PVEC were 
applied to PET data. DEP subjects showed significant hypometabolism in 
fronto-temporal cortices and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) when 
contrasted against NON-DEP in uncorrected data. Both in VOI- and SPM-based 
approaches PVEC eliminated significance in PCC, while fronto-temporal regions 
remained significant or even attained significance such as in case of the left 
amygdala. Subsyndromally depressed CN subjects had decreased FDG metabolism in 
mood-related brain regions, which may be relevant to their elevated risk for 
conversion from CN to MCI. Methodological advances in PET analyses should be 
considered in future studies as PVEC relevantly changed results of FDG-PET for 
detecting apparent metabolic differences between DEP and NON-DEP subjects. 
Furthermore, VOI-based analyses in individual PET space will allow a more 
accurate consideration of variability in anatomy, especially in subcortical 
regions.

The brain is known to play a central role in controlling the desire to eat. We 
aimed to evaluate the brain regions that might have a long-term effect on eating 
behavior and weight changes. We utilized the data of cognitively normal subjects 
who are examined by several neurologic tests, and followed-up for 36 months from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and investigated to 
search the brain regions that are associated with future weight change. The 
weight of each subject was measured on each visit at baseline (W0), 36 (W36) 
months after brain 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography 
(PET). Percentage (%) change of weight was calculated as follows: 
[(W36-W0)/W0]*100. We classified each subject's change into one of three 
categories: weight loss, stable, and weight gain. Dynamic 3-dimensional scans of 
six 5-min frames were acquired 30 mins after injection of 185 MBq of FDG. Image 
analysis was done using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12. Ninety-six subjects 
were included in this study (male 54, female 42). Subjects with future weight 
gain showed hypometabolism in left cerebellum compared with those with future 
weight loss & stable. Percentage change of weight was positively associated with 
brain metabolism in right insula, and right caudate nucleus. In conclusion, 
subjects with future weight gain showed hypometabolism in left cerebellum, and 
percentage change of weight was positively associated with brain metabolism in 
right insula, and right caudate nucleus. This study raises the possibility that 
the brain glucose metabolism precedes the future weight change.

Objectives: Neuropsychological tests are an important basis for the memory 
impairment diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, multiple memory tests 
might be conflicting within-subjects and lead to uncertain diagnoses in some 
cases. This study proposed a framework to diagnose the uncertain cases of memory 
impairment. Methods: We collected 2,386 samples including AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and cognitive normal (CN) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and three different neuropsychological 
tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale, and Clinical Dementia Rating) from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A deep learning (DL) framework using 
FDG-PET was proposed to diagnose uncertain memory impairment cases that were 
conflicting between tests. Subsequent ANOVA, chi-squared, and t-test were used 
to explain the potential causes of uncertain cases. Results: For certain cases 
in the testing set, the proposed DL framework outperformed other methods with 
95.65% accuracy. For the uncertain cases, its positive diagnoses had a 
significant (p < 0.001) worse decline in memory function than negative diagnoses 
in a longitudinal study of 40 months on average. In the memory-impaired group, 
uncertain cases were mainly explained by an AD metabolism pattern but mild in 
extent (p < 0.05). In the healthy group, uncertain cases were mainly explained 
by a non-energetic mental state (p < 0.001) measured using a global 
deterioration scale (GDS), with a significant depression-related metabolism 
pattern detected (p < 0.05). Conclusion: A DL framework for diagnosing uncertain 
cases of memory impairment is proposed. Proved by longitudinal tracing of its 
diagnoses, it showed clinical validity and had application potential. Its valid 
diagnoses also provided evidence and explanation of uncertain cases based on the 
neurodegeneration and depression mental state.

The threat posed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) to human health has grown 
significantly. However, the precise diagnosis and classification of AD stages 
remain a challenge. Neuroimaging methods such as structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (sMRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 
have been used to diagnose and categorize AD. However, feature selection 
approaches that are frequently used to extract additional data from multimodal 
imaging are prone to errors. This paper suggests using a static pulse-coupled 
neural network and a Laplacian pyramid to combine sMRI and FDG-PET data. After 
that, the fused images are used to train the Mobile Vision Transformer (MViT), 
optimized with Pareto-Optimal Quantum Dynamic Optimization for Neural 
Architecture Search, while the fused images are augmented to avoid overfitting 
and then classify unfused MRI and FDG-PET images obtained from the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) 
datasets into various stages of AD. The architectural hyperparameters of MViT 
are optimized using Quantum Dynamic Optimization, which ensures a Pareto-optimal 
solution. The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Mean Squared Error (MSE), 
and the Structured Similarity Indexing Method (SSIM) are used to measure the 
quality of the fused image. We found that the fused image was consistent in all 
metrics, having 0.64 SIMM, 35.60 PSNR, and 0.21 MSE for the FDG-PET image. In 
the classification of AD vs. cognitive normal (CN), AD vs. mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and CN vs. MCI, the precision of the proposed method is 
94.73%, 92.98% and 89.36%, respectively. The sensitivity is 90. 70%, 90. 70%, 
and 90. 91% while the specificity is 100%, 100%, and 85. 71%, respectively, in 
the ADNI MRI test data.

BACKGROUND: Brain glucose hypometabolism has consistently been found in 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). High blood 
glucose and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels have also been linked to 
neurodegeneration and AD. However, there is limited understanding of the 
relationships between dementia-related risk factors in the brain and blood.
METHODS: A linear mixed model was used to examine the relationship between blood 
glucose and HDL-C levels and the progression of brain hypometabolism, adjusting 
for APOE4 and other clinical covariates. The hypometabolic convergence index 
(HCI) was measured by fluorodeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography 
(PET) in participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Data visualizations were generated to understand the joint effects of 
plasma glucose, HDL-C, and APOE4 on HCI.
RESULTS: There were 336 individuals (781 observations), of whom 22.62% had AD. 
The majority were male (63.98%) and of white race, and 48.51% were carriers of 
APOE4. Over time, high blood glucose level was associated with the progression 
of brain glucose hypometabolism (β=0.33, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.64, p<0.05). A high 
plasma HDL-C level (β=1.22, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.35, p<0.05), more study visits 
(β=1.67, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.98, p<0.001), and being an APOE4 allele carrier 
(β=1.29, 95% CI: 0.15, 2.42, p<0.05) were also significant predictors of brain 
hypometabolism progression. APOE4 carrier status and number of visits account 
for the largest proportion of the variance from the fixed effects model. Random 
effects due to participant characteristics and fixed effects together accounted 
for 95.2% of the model variance. Subgroup analysis revealed that these effects 
were observed only in those without AD.
CONCLUSION: High plasma glucose levels facilitated the progression of brain 
hypometabolism. The effect was more prominent in the APOE4 double-carriers with 
elevated HDL-C. Elevated blood glucose may reflect systemic insulin resistance, 
which could impair brain glucose uptake, resulting in brain hypometabolism. 
Controlling blood glucose and HDL-C levels in APOE4 carriers may improve brain 
metabolism, potentially delaying the onset of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Besides their other roles, brain imaging and other biomarkers of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have the potential to inform a cognitively unimpaired 
(CU) person's likelihood of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
benefit subject selection when evaluating promising prevention therapies. We 
previously described that among baseline FDG-PET and MRI measures known to be 
preferentially affected in the preclinical and clinical stages of AD, 
hippocampal volume was the best predictor of incident MCI within 2 years 
(79%sensitivity/78%specificity), using standard automated MRI volumetric 
algorithmic programs, binary logistic regression, and leave-one-out procedures.
OBJECTIVE: To improve the same prediction by using different hippocampal 
features and machine learning methods, cross-validated via two independent and 
prospective cohorts (Arizona and ADNI).
METHODS: Patch-based sparse coding algorithms were applied to hippocampal 
surface features of baseline TI-MRIs from 78 CU adults who subsequently 
progressed to amnestic MCI in approximately 2 years ("progressors") and 80 
matched adults who remained CU for at least 4 years ("nonprogressors"). 
Nonprogressors and progressors were matched for age, sex, education, and 
apolipoprotein E4 allele dose. We did not include amyloid or tau biomarkers in 
defining MCI.
RESULTS: We achieved 92%prediction accuracy in the Arizona cohort, 92%prediction 
accuracy in the ADNI cohort, and 90%prediction accuracy when combining the two 
demographically distinct cohorts, as compared to 79%(Arizona) and 72%(ADNI) 
prediction accuracy using hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSION: Surface multivariate morphometry and sparse coding, applied to 
individual MRIs, may accurately predict imminent progression to MCI even in the 
absence of other AD biomarkers.

Cigarette smoking is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
but the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. In this study, we aimed to 
examine the effects of cigarette smoking on multiple AD biomarkers among older 
individuals with normal cognition (NC). Among 415 older individuals with NC from 
the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, we examined the 
associations between smoking status (non-smokers vs smokers) and global 
cognition, verbal memory, hippocampal volumes, cerebral glucose metabolism and 
CSF AD pathologies. The primary findings of this study were: (1) In NC, smokers 
showed worse performance on verbal memory tests [Rey Auditory Verbal Learning 
Test (RAVLT) total learning score and delayed recall] than non-smokers; (2) 
Compared with non-smokers, smokers had significantly lower HpVR; (3) Smokers, 
relative to non-smokers, demonstrated lower levels of cerebral glucose 
metabolism as measured by FDG-PET; and (4) there were no significant differences 
in CSF AD pathologies (CSF Aβ42, t-tau or p-tau) between non-smokers and 
smokers. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the relationship between 
cigarettes smoking and changes in AD-related markers over time. Further, ADNI 
participants were highly educated and predominantly white. This may limit the 
generalizability of our results. In summary, among individuals with NC, 
cigarette smoking was associated with memory impairment, hippocampal atrophy and 
cerebral glucose hypometabolism, but not CSF AD pathologies.

Multi-View Separable Pyramid Network for AD Prediction at MCI Stage by (18)F-FDG 
Brain PET Imaging.

Pan X, Phan TL, Adel M, Fossati C, Gaidon T, Wojak J, Guedj E.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), one of the main causes of death in elderly people, is 
characterized by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at prodromal stage. 
Nevertheless, only part of MCI subjects could progress to AD. The main objective 
of this paper is thus to identify those who will develop a dementia of AD type 
among MCI patients. 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG 
PET) serves as a neuroimaging modality for early diagnosis as it can reflect 
neural activity via measuring glucose uptake at resting-state. In this paper, we 
design a deep network on 18F-FDG PET modality to address the problem of AD 
identification at early MCI stage. To this end, a Multi-view Separable Pyramid 
Network (MiSePyNet) is proposed, in which representations are learned from 
axial, coronal and sagittal views of PET scans so as to offer complementary 
information and then combined to make a decision jointly. Different from the 
widely and naturally used 3D convolution operations for 3D images, the proposed 
architecture is deployed with separable convolution from slice-wise to 
spatial-wise successively, which can retain the spatial information and reduce 
training parameters compared to 2D and 3D networks, respectively. Experiments on 
ADNI dataset show that the proposed method can yield better performance than 
both traditional and deep learning-based algorithms for predicting the 
progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment, with a classification accuracy of 
83.05%.

Utilizing the publicly available neuroimaging database enabled by Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ ), we have 
compared the performance of automated classification algorithms that 
differentiate AD vs. normal subjects using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). General linear model, scaled subprofile modeling 
and support vector machines were examined. Among the tested classification 
methods, support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm produced 
the best performance, i.e., sensitivity (0.84) × specificity (0.95), by 10-fold 
cross-validation. We have applied the same classification algorithm to four 
different datasets from ADNI, Health Science Centre (Winnipeg, Canada), Dong-A 
University Hospital (Busan, S. Korea) and Asan Medical Centre (Seoul, S. Korea). 
Our data analyses confirmed that the support vector machine with Iterative 
Single Data Algorithm showed the best performance in prediction of future 
development of AD from the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment), and that 
it was also sensitive to other types of dementia such as Parkinson's Disease 
Dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and that perfusion imaging using single 
photon emission computed tomography may achieve a similar accuracy to that of 
FDG-PET.

PURPOSE: The aim of this feasibility study was to use slice selective learning 
using a Generative Adversarial Network for external validation. We aimed to 
build a model less sensitive to PET imaging acquisition environment, since 
differences in environments negatively influence network performance. To 
investigate the slice performance, each slice evaluation was performed.
METHODS: We trained our model using a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/CT 
dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database and tested the model with a Severance Hospital dataset. We applied 
slice selective learning to reduce computational cost and to extract unbiased 
features. We extracted features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal cognitive 
(NC) condition using a Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network 
(BEGAN) for stable convergence. Then, we utilized these features to train a 
support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish AD from NC.
RESULTS: The slice range that covered the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) using 
double slices showed the best performance. The accuracy, sensitivity, and 
specificity of our proposed network was 94.33%, 91.78%, and 97.06% using the 
Severance dataset and 94.82%, 92.11%, and 97.45% using the ADNI dataset. The 
performance on the two independent datasets showed no statistical difference 
(p > 0.05). Moreover, there was a statistical difference in the performance 
between using two slices and one slice as input (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our model learned the generalized features of AD and NC for 
external validation when appropriate slices were selected. This study showed the 
feasibility of this model with consistent performance when tested using datasets 
acquired from a variety of image-acquisition environments.

Longitudinal FDG-PET features for the classification of Alzheimer's disease.

Rodrigues F, Silveira M.

The majority of existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) rely on the analysis of biomarkers at a single time-point, ignoring 
the progressive nature of the disorder. Recently, a method was proposed by Gray 
et al. [1] for the multi-region analysis of longitudinal fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images which reported classification 
improvements by using regional signal intensities combined with regional change 
over a 12 month period. In this paper we extend the approach proposed in [1] to 
the analysis of the entire brain pattern. Compared to [1], our method uses 
voxel-wise differences and avoids segmentation of the images into regions of 
interest. For our study, FDG-PET scans at the baseline and at 12-month follow-up 
of cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects were 
retrieved from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. 
For both AD and MCI identification, the best classification results were 
achieved by combining cross-sectional and longitudinal information rather than 
using only the cross-sectional data. Furthermore, the longitudinal voxel-based 
analysis outperformed multi-region analysis.

BACKGROUND: Autopsy series commonly report a high percentage of coincident 
pathologies in demented patients, including patients with a clinical diagnosis 
of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). However many clinical and biomarker 
studies report cases with a single neurodegenerative disease. We examined 
multimodal biomarker correlates of the consecutive series of the first 22 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative autopsies. Clinical data, 
neuropsychological measures, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, total and phosphorylated 
tau and α-synuclein and MRI and FDG-PET scans.
RESULTS: Clinical diagnosis was either probable DAT or Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-type mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at last evaluation prior to death. All 
patients had a pathological diagnosis of AD, but only four had pure AD. A 
coincident pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), medial 
temporal lobe pathology (TDP-43 proteinopathy, argyrophilic grain disease and 
hippocampal sclerosis), referred to collectively here as MTL, and vascular 
pathology were present in 45.5%, 40.0% and 22.7% of these patients, 
respectively. Hallucinations were a strong predictor of coincident DLB (100% 
specificity) and a more severe dysexecutive profile was also a useful predictor 
of coincident DLB (80.0% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity). Occipital FDG-PET 
hypometabolism accurately classified coincident DLB (80% sensitivity and 100% 
specificity). Subjects with coincident MTL showed lower hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers can be used to independently predict coincident AD and 
DLB pathology, a common finding in amnestic MCI and DAT patients. Cohorts with 
comprehensive neuropathological assessments and multimodal biomarkers are needed 
to characterize independent predictors for the different neuropathological 
substrates of cognitive impairment.

Imaging cerebral glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has allowed for improved characterisation of this 
pathology. Such patterns are typically analysed using either univariate or 
multivariate statistical techniques. In this work we combined voxel-based group 
analysis and independent component analysis to extract differential 
characteristic patterns from PET data of glucose metabolism in a large cohort of 
normal elderly controls and patients with AD. The patterns were used in 
conjunction with a support vector machine to discriminate between subjects with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at risk or not of converting to AD. The method 
was applied to baseline fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET images of subjects from 
the ADNI database. Our approach achieved improved early detection and 
differentiation of typical versus pathological metabolic patterns in the MCI 
population, reaching 80% accuracy (85% sensitivity and 75% specificity) when 
using selected regions. The method has the potential to assist in the advance 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and to identify early in the development of 
the disease those individuals at high risk of rapid cognitive decline who could 
be candidates for new therapeutic approaches.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to evaluate brain metabolism in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with and without apathy (as determined by 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire).
METHODS: Baseline data from 65 MCI participants (11 with apathy and 54 without) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative study were analyzed. 
All participants underwent a comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric 
assessment, volumetric MRI and measures of cerebral glucose metabolism applying 
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography at baseline. The presence 
of apathy at baseline was determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: There was no difference between apathy and apathy-free MCI patients 
regarding cognitive assessment and neuropsychiatric measures when 
apathy-specific items were removed. Cerebrovascular disease load and cerebral 
atrophy were equivalent in both groups. Compared with the apathy-free MCI 
patients, MCI patients with apathy had significantly decreased metabolism in the 
posterior cingulate cortex.
CONCLUSION: The presence of apathy in MCI patients is associated with 
AD-specific pattern of brain metabolic defect. These results could suggest that 
apathy belongs to the spectrum of prodromal AD symptoms.

Brain iron dyshomeostasis is a feature of Alzheimer's disease. Conventionally, 
research has focused on non-heme iron although degradation of heme from 
hemoglobin subunits can generate iron to augment the redox-active iron pool. 
Hemopexin both detoxifies heme to maintain iron homeostasis and bolsters 
antioxidant capacity via catabolic products, biliverdin and carbon monoxide to 
combat iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. The aim of the present study was to 
examine the association of cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) hemopexin and 
hemoglobin subunits (α and β) to Alzheimer's pathological proteins (amyloid and 
tau), hippocampal volume and metabolism, and cognitive performance. We analyzed 
baseline CSF heme/iron proteins (multiplexed mass spectrometry-based assay), 
amyloid and tau (Luminex platform), baseline/longitudinal neuroimaging (MRI, 
FDG-PET) and cognitive outcomes in 86 cognitively normal, 135 mild-cognitive 
impairment and 66 Alzheimer's participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort. Multivariate regression analysis was 
performed to delineate differences in CSF proteins between diagnosis groups and 
evaluated their association to amyloid and tau, neuroimaging and cognition. A 
p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Higher hemopexin was associated with 
higher CSF amyloid (implying decreased brain amyloid deposition), improved 
hippocampal metabolism and cognitive performance. Meanwhile, hemoglobin subunits 
were associated with increased CSF tau (implying increased brain tau 
deposition). When dichotomizing individuals with mild-cognitive impairment into 
stable and converters to Alzheimer's disease, significantly higher baseline 
hemoglobin subunits were observed in the converters compared to non-converters. 
Heme/iron dyshomeostasis is an early and crucial event in AD pathophysiology, 
which warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic target.

Normal aging is accompanied by structural degeneration and glucose 
hypometabolism in the human brain. However, the relationship between structural 
network disconnections and hypometabolism in normal aging remains largely 
unknown. In the present study, by combining MRI and PET techniques, we 
investigated the metabolic mechanism of the structural brain connectome and its 
relationship with normal aging in a cross-sectional, community-based cohort of 
42 cognitively normal elderly individuals aged 57-84 years. The structural 
connectome was constructed based on diffusion MRI tractography, and the network 
efficiency metrics were quantified using graph theory analyses. FDG-PET scanning 
was performed to evaluate the glucose metabolic level in the cortical regions of 
the individuals. The results of this study demonstrated that both network 
efficiency and cortical metabolism decrease with age (both p < 0.05). In the 
subregions of the bilateral thalamus, significant correlations between nodal 
efficiency and cortical metabolism could be observed across subjects. 
Individual-level analyses indicated that brain regions with higher nodal 
efficiency tend to exhibit higher metabolic levels, implying a tight coupling 
between nodal efficiency and glucose metabolism (r = 0.56, p = 1.15 × 10-21). 
Moreover, efficiency-metabolism coupling coefficient significantly increased 
with age (r = 0.44, p = 0.0046). Finally, the main findings were also 
reproducible in the ADNI dataset. Together, our results demonstrate a close 
coupling between structural brain connectivity and cortical metabolism in normal 
elderly individuals and provide new insight that improve the present 
understanding of the metabolic mechanisms of structural brain disconnections in 
normal aging.

Accurate prediction of clinical changes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
patients, including both qualitative change (i.e., conversion to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD)) and quantitative change (i.e., cognitive scores) at future time 
points, is important for early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring the disease 
progression. In this paper, we propose to predict future clinical changes of MCI 
patients by using both baseline and longitudinal multimodality data. To do this, 
we first develop a longitudinal feature selection method to jointly select brain 
regions across multiple time points for each modality. Specifically, for each 
time point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data 
and the corresponding clinical scores, with an extra 'group regularization' to 
group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across multiple time 
points together and to allow for selection of brain regions based on the 
strength of multiple time points jointly. Then, to further reflect the 
longitudinal changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of 
longitudinal features from the original baseline and longitudinal data. Finally, 
we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different 
modalities, for prediction by using our previously proposed multi-kernel SVM. We 
validate our method on 88 ADNI MCI subjects, with both MRI and FDG-PET data and 
the corresponding clinical scores (i.e., MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 5 different time 
points. We first predict the clinical scores (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 24-month by 
using the multimodality data at previous time points, and then predict the 
conversion of MCI to AD by using the multimodality data at time points which are 
at least 6-month ahead of the conversion. The results on both sets of 
experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance in 
predicting future clinical changes of MCI patients than the conventional 
methods.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have suggested that greater adiposity in older 
adults is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related 
cognitive decline, some investigators have postulated that this association may 
be due to the protective effects of the adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin. 
In this study we sought to demonstrate that higher body mass indices (BMIs) are 
associated with greater baseline FDG PET measurements of the regional cerebral 
metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRgl), a marker of local neuronal activity, slower 
rCMRgl declines in research participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(aMCI). We then sought to clarify the extent to which those relationships are 
attributable to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma leptin concentrations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used baseline PET images from 716 73 ± 8 years-old 
aMCI participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) of whom 453 had 
follow up images (≥6 months; mean follow up time 3.3 years). For the leptin 
analyses, we used baseline CSF samples from 81 of the participants and plasma 
samples from 212 of the participants.
RESULTS: As predicted, higher baseline BMI was associated with greater baseline 
CMRgl measurements and slower declines within brain regions preferentially 
affected by AD. In contrast and independently of BMI, CSF, and plasma leptin 
concentrations were mainly related to less baseline CMRgl within 
mesocorticolimbic brain regions implicated in energy homeostasis.
DISCUSSION: While higher BMIs are associated with greater baseline CMRgl and 
slower declines in persons with aMCI, these associations appear not to be 
primarily attributable to leptin concentrations.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in 
cognitively normal (CN) seniors on regional metabolism of specific brain regions 
known to be affected by p-tau deposition.
METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), volumetric 
magnetic resonance imaging scans, and global amyloid standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVr) were obtained for 210 CNs from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI2). Region of interest (ROI) extraction was used 
to obtain functional SUVr from six bilateral ROIs: amygdala (AM), entorhinal 
cortex (EC), hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal, posterior cingulate (PC), and 
middle temporal gyrus. Every metabolic SUVr set was averaged and analyzed 
against the corresponding subject's amyloid SUVr. Correlation analyses were 
conducted on the full group and between APOE ε4-positive and APOE ε4-negative 
subgroups.
RESULTS: The APOE ε4+ group exhibited significantly higher metabolism in the EC 
(r = 0.270, P = .038) and AM (r = 0.267, P = .041). When a significance of the 
difference test was conducted between the APOE ε4+ and APOE ε4-groups, these 
same regions remained significant: P = .012 and P = .016, respectively. By 
contrast, the APOE ε4 group displayed only the conventionally expected result of 
reduced regional metabolism in the PC (r = -0.161, P = .048), with higher Aβ 
load.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of amyloid positivity on brain metabolism is regionally 
specific, and APOE ε4 status substantially modulates regional glucose uptake in 
these regions. The APOE ε4 allele may cause earlier emergence of clinical 
symptoms in AD via a mechanism that influences regional metabolic demand in 
specifically those regions where p-tau deposition is known to occur earliest.

β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology is not always coupled with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
relevant cognitive decline. We assessed the accuracy of tau PET to identify 
Aβ(+) individuals who show prospective disease progression. 396 cognitively 
unimpaired and impaired individuals with baseline Aβ and tau PET and a follow-up 
of ≥ 2 years were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
dataset. The participants were dichotomously grouped based on either clinical 
conversion (i.e., change of diagnosis) or cognitive deterioration (fast (FDs) 
vs. slow decliners (SDs)) using data-driven clustering of the individual annual 
rates of cognitive decline. To assess cognitive decline in individuals with 
isolated Aβ(+) or absence of both Aβ and tau (T) pathologies, we investigated 
the prevalence of non-AD comorbidities and FDG PET hypometabolism patterns 
suggestive of AD. Baseline tau PET uptake was higher in Aβ(+)FDs than in 
Aβ(-)FD/SDs and Aβ(+)SDs, independently of baseline cognitive status. Baseline 
tau PET uptake identified MCI Aβ(+) Converters and Aβ(+)FDs with an area under 
the curve of 0.85 and 0.87 (composite temporal region of interest) respectively, 
and was linearly related to the annual rate of cognitive decline in Aβ(+) 
individuals. The T(+) individuals constituted largely a subgroup of those being 
Aβ(+) and those clustered as FDs. The most common biomarker profiles in FDs 
(n = 70) were Aβ(+)T(+) (n = 34, 49%) and Aβ(+)T(-) (n = 19, 27%). Baseline Aβ 
load was higher in Aβ(+)T(+)FDs (M = 83.03 ± 31.42CL) than in Aβ(+)T(-)FDs 
(M = 63.67 ± 26.75CL) (p-value = 0.038). Depression diagnosis was more prevalent 
in Aβ(+)T(-)FDs compared to Aβ(+)T(+)FDs (47% vs. 15%, p-value = 0.021), as were 
FDG PET hypometabolism pattern not suggestive of AD (86% vs. 50%, 
p-value = 0.039). Our findings suggest that high tau PET uptake is coupled with 
both Aβ pathology and accelerated cognitive decline. In cases of isolated Aβ(+), 
cognitive decline may be associated with changes within the AD spectrum in a 
multi-morbidity context, i.e., mixed AD.

Previous studies of Aβ plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline 
Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) plasma measurement (50% with 4 serial annual 
measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their 
concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and 
Aβ(1-42) measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between Aβ and 
diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions 
were associated with altered concentrations of plasma Aβ. The effect of age 
differed according to AD stage. Plasma Aβ(1-42) showed mild correlation with 
other biomarkers of Aβ pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. 
Longitudinal measurements of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) plasma levels showed modest 
value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of 
complementary measures of Aβ pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma Aβ) and other 
biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is 
significant because it shows that plasma Aβ measurements have limited value for 
disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year 
follow-up. However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma Aβ measurements 
could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at 
increased risk for AD. Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding 
of the biology and dynamics of plasma Aβ as well as the need for longer term 
studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Aβ.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) is partially cleared from the CSF via skull base 
perivascular and perineural lymphatic pathways, particularly at the nasal 
cavity. In vivo differences in Aβ level at the nasal cavity between patients 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
cognitively normal (CN) individuals have not been previously assessed.
METHODS: This is a retrospective evaluation of subject level data from the 
ADNI-1/GO database. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) maximum on 
11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB)-PET was assessed at the nasal cavity on 223 
scans. Exploratory ROI analysis was also performed at other skull base sites. 
SUVR maximum values and their differences between groups (CN, MCI, AD) were 
assessed. CSF Aβ levels and CSF Aβ 42/40 ratios were correlated with SUVR 
maximum values.
RESULTS: 103 subjects with 223 PiB-PET scans (47 CN, 32 AD and 144 MCI) were 
included in the study. The SUVR maxima at the nasal cavity were significantly 
lower in subjects with AD [1.35 (± 0.31)] compared to CN [1.54 (± 0.30); 
p = 0.024] and MCI [1.49 (± 0.33); p = 0.049]. At very low CSF Aβ, less than 
132 pg/ml, there was significant correlation with nasal cavity SUVR maximum. The 
summed averaged SUVR maximum values were significantly lower in subjects with AD 
[1.35 (± 0.16)] compared to CN [1.49 (± 0.17); p = 0.003] and MCI [1.40 
(± 0.17); p = 0.017].
CONCLUSION: Patients with AD demonstrate reduced nasal cavity PiB-PET 
radiotracer uptake compared to MCI and CN, possibly representing reduced Aβ 
clearance via perineural/perivascular lymphatic pathway. Further work is 
necessary to elucidate the true nature of this finding.

Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm that predicts the 
final diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or neither 
at fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET of the brain and compare its 
performance to that of radiologic readers. Materials and Methods Prospective 
18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective 
independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were 
collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional 
neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set 
and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with 
performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, 
specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and 
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area 
under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated 
on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set 
(82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the 
final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four 
of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P < .05). Saliency map 
demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire 
brain. Conclusion By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a 
deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease 
achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to 
the final diagnosis. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and 
dementia and people with MCI are at high risk of progression to dementia. MCI is 
attracting increasing attention, as it offers an opportunity to target the 
disease process during an early symptomatic stage. Structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) measures have been the mainstay of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
imaging research, however, ventricular morphometry analysis remains challenging 
because of its complicated topological structure. Here we describe a novel 
ventricular morphometry system based on the hyperbolic Ricci flow method and 
tensor-based morphometry (TBM) statistics. Unlike prior ventricular surface 
parameterization methods, hyperbolic conformal parameterization is 
angle-preserving and does not have any singularities. Our system generates a 
one-to-one diffeomorphic mapping between ventricular surfaces with consistent 
boundary matching conditions. The TBM statistics encode a great deal of surface 
deformation information that could be inaccessible or overlooked by other 
methods. We applied our system to the baseline MRI scans of a set of MCI 
subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI: 71 MCI 
converters vs. 62 MCI stable). Although the combined ventricular area and volume 
features did not differ between the two groups, our fine-grained surface 
analysis revealed significant differences in the ventricular regions close to 
the temporal lobe and posterior cingulate, structures that are affected early in 
AD. Significant correlations were also detected between ventricular morphometry, 
neuropsychological measures, and a previously described imaging index based on 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans. This novel 
ventricular morphometry method may offer a new and more sensitive approach to 
study preclinical and early symptomatic stage AD.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε 4 has been identified as the strongest 
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the importance of 
ApoE ε 4 on clinical and biological heterogeneity of AD is still to be 
determined, particularly at the prodromal stage. Here, we evaluate the 
association of ApoE ε 4 with clinical cognition and neuroimaging regions in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) participants based on the AT (N) system, which is 
increasingly essential for developing a precise assessment of AD.
METHODS: We stratified 178 A+T+MCI participants (prodromal AD) into ApoE ε 4 (+) 
and ApoE ε 4 (-) according to ApoE genotype from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We determined Aβ-positivity (A+) by the 
standardized uptake values ratios (SUVR) means of florbetapir-PET-AV45 (the 
cut-off value of 1.1) and fibrillar tau-positivity (T+) by cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) phosphorylated-tau at threonine 181 position (p-Tau) (cut-off value of 23 
pg/mL). We evaluated the effect of ApoE ε 4 status on cognitive conditions and 
brain atrophy from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A 
multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare the differences of 
cognitive scores and brain atrophy from structural MRI regions of interest 
(ROIs) between both groups. Furthermore, we performed a linear regression model 
to assess the correlation between signature ROIs of structural MRI and cognitive 
scores in the prodromal AD participants.
RESULTS: ApoE ε 4 (+) prodromal AD participants had lower levels of CSF Aβ 1-42, 
higher levels of t-Tau, more memory and global cognitive impairment, and faster 
decline of global cognition, compared to ApoE ε 4 (-) prodromal AD. ApoE ε 4 (+) 
prodromal AD participants had a thinner cortical thickness of bilateral 
entorhinal, smaller subcortical volume of the left amygdala, bilateral 
hippocampus, and left ventral diencephalon (DC) relative to ApoE ε 4 (-) 
prodromal AD. Furthermore, the cortical thickness average of bilateral 
entorhinal was highly correlated with memory and global cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: ApoE ε 4 status in prodromal AD participants has an important 
effect on clinical cognitive domains. After ascertaining the ApoE ε 4 status, 
specific MRI regions can be correlated to the cognitive domain and will be 
helpful for precise assessment in prodromal AD.

BACKGROUND: Depression is considered a psychological risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We sought to examine the differential associations of depression 
severity with cognitive decline, clinical progression to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD, and neuroimaging markers of AD in cognitively normal 
older adults.
METHODS: A total of 522 cognitively normal (CN) participants who underwent 
assessments for depression (longitudinal geriatric depression scale [GDS] ) and 
cognitive assessments were included from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of 
the rate of change in GDS with amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography 
(PET), tau-PET, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET were explored. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves of clinical progression and Aβ accumulation were plotted based 
on mean annual changes in GDS. Mediation analyses were utilized to explore the 
mediation effects of AD markers.
RESULTS: Higher rate of increase in GDS was associated with faster cognitive 
decline and higher risk of progression to MCI or AD. Moreover, the rate of 
change in GDS was significantly associated with Aβ accumulation and cerebral 
glucose metabolism. The influences of the rate of change in GDS on cognition and 
clinical progression were partially mediated by Aβ accumulation and cerebral 
glucose metabolism.
LIMITATIONS: GDS is a self-reported questionnaire and not the same as a clinical 
diagnosis of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive and clinical consequences of changes in depressive 
symptoms partly stem from Aβ accumulation and cerebral glucose metabolism, which 
increases our understanding of how depressive symptoms may increase 
vulnerability to dementia.

(11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and (18)F-florbetapir amyloid-β (Aβ) PET 
radioligands have had a substantial impact on Alzheimer disease research. 
Although there is evidence that both radioligands bind to fibrillar Aβ in the 
brain, direct comparisons in the same individuals have not been reported. Here, 
we evaluated PiB and florbetapir in a retrospective convenience sample of 
cognitively normal older controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 
patients with Alzheimer disease from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI).
METHODS: From the ADNI database, 32 participants were identified who had 
undergone at least 1 PiB study and subsequently underwent a florbetapir study 
approximately 1.5 y after the last PiB study. Cortical PiB and florbetapir 
retention was quantified using several different methods to determine the effect 
of preprocessing factors (such as smoothing and reference region selection) and 
image processing pipelines.
RESULTS: There was a strong association between PiB and florbetapir cortical 
retention ratios (Spearman ρ = 0.86-0.95), and these were slightly lower than 
cortical retention ratios for consecutive PiB scans (Spearman ρ = 0.96-0.98) 
made approximately 1.1 y apart. Cortical retention ratios for Aβ-positive 
subjects tended to be higher for PiB than for florbetapir images, yielding 
slopes for linear regression of florbetapir against PiB of 0.59-0.64. 
Associations between consecutive PiB scans and between PiB and florbetapir scans 
remained strong, regardless of processing methods such as smoothing, spatial 
normalization to a PET template, and use of reference regions. The 
PiB-florbetapir association was used to interconvert cutoffs for Aβ positivity 
and negativity between the 2 radioligands, and these cutoffs were highly 
consistent in their assignment of Aβ status.
CONCLUSION: PiB and florbetapir retention ratios were strongly associated in the 
same individuals, and this relationship was consistent across several data 
analysis methods, despite scan-rescan intervals of more than a year. Cutoff 
thresholds for determining positive or negative Aβ status can be reliably 
transformed from PiB to florbetapir units or vice versa using a population 
scanned with both radioligands.

Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of tau and amyloid beta42 suggest 
possible active underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) including neurometabolic 
dysfunction and neurodegeneration leading to eventual cognitive decline. But the 
temporal relationship between CSF, imaging markers of neural function, and 
cognition has not been described. Using a statistical mediation model, we 
examined relationships between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes 
(hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau(181p)), β-amyloid peptides 1-42 (Aβ(1-42)), 
total tau (t-Tau), and their ratios); change in cognitive function; and change 
in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake using positron emission tomography 
(PET). We hypothesized that a) abnormal CSF protein values at baseline, result 
in cognitive declines by decreasing neuronal glucose metabolism across time, and 
b) the role of altered glucose metabolism in the assumed causal chain varies by 
brain region and the nature of CSF protein alteration. Data from 412 individuals 
participating in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) cohort studies were 
included in analyses. At baseline, individuals were cognitively normal (N = 82), 
or impaired: 241 with mild cognitive impairment, and 89 with Alzheimer's 
disease. A parallel-process latent growth curve model was used to test 
mediational effects of changes in regional FDG-PET uptake over time in relation 
to baseline CSF biomarkers and changes in cognition, measured with the 13-item 
Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Findings 
suggested a causal sequence of events; specifically, FDG hypometabolism acted as 
a mediator between antecedent CSF biomarker alterations and subsequent cognitive 
impairment. Higher baseline concentrations of t-Tau, and p-Tau(181p) were more 
predictive of decline in cerebral glucose metabolism than lower baseline 
concentrations of Aβ(1-42). FDG-PET changes appeared to mediate t-Tau or 
t-Tau/Aβ(1-42)-associated cognitive change across all brain regions examined. 
Significant direct effects of alterations in Aβ(1-42) levels on hypometabolism 
were observed in a single brain region: middle/inferior temporal gyrus. Results 
support a temporal framework model in which reduced CSF amyloid-related 
biomarkers occur earlier in the pathogenic pathway, ultimately leading to 
detrimental cognitive effects. Also consistent with this temporal framework 
model, baseline markers of neurofibrillary degeneration predicted changes in 
brain glucose metabolism in turn causing longitudinal cognitive changes, 
suggesting that tau-related burden precedes neurometabolic dysfunction. While 
intriguing, the hypothesized mediational relationships require further 
validation.

Functional brain imaging is a common tool in monitoring the progression of 
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Identifying functional brain 
imaging derived features that can accurately detect neurological disease is of 
primary importance to the medical community. Research in computer vision 
techniques to identify objects in photographs have reported high accuracies in 
that domain, but their direct applicability to identifying disease in functional 
imaging is still under investigation in the medical community. In particular, 
Serre et al. (: In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 
(CVPR-05). pp 994-1000) introduced a biophysically inspired filtering method 
emulating visual processing in striate cortex which they applied to perform 
object recognition in photographs. In this work, the model described by Serre et 
al. [2005] is extended to three-dimensional volumetric images to perform signal 
detection in functional brain imaging (PET, SPECT). The filter outputs are used 
to train both neural network and logistic regression classifiers and tested on 
two distinct datasets: ADNI Alzheimer's disease 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET and 
National Football League players Tc99m HMPAO SPECT. The filtering pipeline is 
analyzed to identify which steps are most important for classification accuracy. 
Our results compare favorably with other published classification results and 
outperform those of a blinded expert human rater, suggesting the utility of this

BACKGROUND: It is unknown which commonly used Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker 
values-baseline or progression-best predict longitudinal cognitive decline.
METHODS: 526 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). ADNI composite memory and executive scores were the primary outcomes. 
Individual-specific slope of the longitudinal trajectory of each biomarker was 
first estimated. These estimates and observed baseline biomarker values were 
used as predictors of cognitive declines. Variability in cognitive declines 
explained by baseline biomarker values was compared with variability explained 
by biomarker progression values.
RESULTS: About 40% of variability in memory and executive function declines was 
explained by ventricular volume progression among mild cognitive impairment 
patients. A total of 84% of memory and 65% of executive function declines were 
explained by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) score 
progression and ventricular volume progression, respectively, among AD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: For most biomarkers, biomarker progressions explained higher 
variability in cognitive decline than biomarker baseline values. This has 
important implications for clinical trials targeted to modify AD biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) has been identified as one of the most 
associated loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and recently was reported to 
modulate tau pathology to mediate AD in vitro. However, the effects of BIN1 on 
the AD related biomarkers in AD continuum were not specifically assessed.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the effects of BIN1 loci on AD specific biomarkers (CSF 
proteins, brain structures, glucose and amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolisms) to 
investigate the role BIN1 in AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: We calculated the associations of BIN1 loci with these markers at 
baseline and follow-up in multiple linear models in 812 ADNI subjects.
RESULTS: BIN1 loci were significantly associated with the levels of T-tau 
(rs744373: pc = 0.047, rs13031703: pc = 0.042) and P-tau (rs744373: pc = 0.044, 
rs13031703: pc = 0.019), but not with Aβ in CSF test. BIN1 genotypes were 
strongly related to atrophy of hippocampus (rs7561528: pc = 0.011), CA1 
(rs1469980: pc = 0.029) and parahippocampus (rs72838284, pc = 0.017) on MRI, and 
to glucose metabolism on FDG-PET, but not to Aβ deposition on AV45-PET imaging. 
Furthermore, haplotype and subgroup analysis confirmed these significant 
findings. In addition, the loci associated with these markers were also 
identified to influence the risk for AD in the meta-analysis of 74 046 European 
individuals.
CONCLUSION: This study supported that BIN1 contributes to the risk of AD by 
altering neural degeneration (abnormal tau, brain atrophy and glucose 
metabolism) but not Aβ pathology.

BACKGROUND: Over 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with 
increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We categorized these loci into 
immunity, lipid metabolism, and endocytosis pathways, and associated the 
polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated, with AD biomarkers in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) subjects.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify associations between 
pathway-specific PRS and AD biomarkers in patients with MCI and healthy 
controls.
METHODS: AD biomarkers ([18F]Florbetapir-PET SUVR, FDG-PET SUVR, hippocampal 
volume, CSF tau and amyloid-β levels) and neurocognitive tests scores were 
obtained in 258 healthy controls and 451 MCI subjects from the ADNI dataset at 
baseline and at 24-month follow up. Pathway-related (immunity, lipid metabolism, 
and endocytosis) and total polygenic risk scores were calculated from 20 SNPs. 
Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test predictive value of the 
polygenic risk scores over longitudinal biomarker and cognitive changes.
RESULTS: Higher immune risk score was associated with worse cognitive measures 
and reduced glucose metabolism. Higher lipid risk score was associated with 
increased amyloid deposition and cortical hypometabolism. Total, immune, and 
lipid scores were associated with significant changes in cognitive measures, 
amyloid deposition, and brain metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Polygenic risk scores highlights the influence of specific genes on 
amyloid-dependent and independent pathways; and these pathways could be 
differentially influenced by lipid and immune scores respectively.

Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder and the most common form of dementia in the older people. Some types of 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are the clinical precursors of AD, while other 
MCI forms tend to remain stable over time and do not progress to AD. To 
discriminate MCI patients at risk of AD from stable MCI, we propose a novel 
deep-learning radiomics (DLR) model based on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) images and combine DLR features with clinical 
parameters (DLR+C) to improve diagnostic performance. Methods: 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data from the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI) were collected, 
including 168 patients with MCI who converted to AD within 3 years and 187 
patients with MCI without conversion within 3 years. These subjects were 
randomly partitioned into 90 % for the training/validation group and 10 % for 
the independent test group. The proposed DLR approach consists of three steps: 
base DL model pre-training, network features extraction, and integration of 
DLR+C, where a convolution network serves as a feature encoder, and a support 
vector machine (SVM) operated as the classifier. In comparative experiments, we 
compared our DLR+C method with four other methods: the standard uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) method, Radiomics-ROI method, Clinical method, and SUVR + Clinical 
method. To guarantee the robustness, 10-fold cross-validation was processed 100 
times. Results: Under the DLR model, our proposed DLR+C was advantageous and 
yielded the best classification performance in the diagnosis of conversion with 
the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 90.62 ± 1.16, 87.50 ± 0.00, and 
93.39 ± 2.19%, respectively. In contrast, the respective accuracy of the other 
four methods reached 68.38 ± 1.27, 73.31 ± 6.93, 81.09 ± 1.97, and 85.35 ± 0.72 
%. These results suggested the DLR approach could be used successfully in the 
prediction of conversion to AD, and that our proposed DLR-combined clinical 
information was effective. Conclusions: This study showed DLR+C could provide a 
novel and valuable method for the computer-assisted diagnosis of conversion to 
AD from MCI. This DLR+C method provided a quantitative biomarker which could 
predict conversion to AD in MCI patients.

BACKGROUND: Brain beta-amyloid status portends different trajectories of 
clinical decline.
OBJECTIVE: Determine trajectories and predictive baseline variable(s).
DESIGN: Longitudinal, up to 24 months.
SETTING: ADNI sites.
PARTICIPANTS: Healthy control (n=325), early and late mild cognitive impairment 
(n=279; n=372), and Alzheimer's dementia (n=216) subjects from ADNI-1/GO/2.
MEASUREMENTS: Baseline amyloid status was based on first available CSF Aβ1-42 
or, [11C]PiB or [18F]florbetapir (FBP) PET. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and Functional Activities Questionnaire 
(FAQ) were co-analyzed using Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) to define latent 
class trajectories for each amyloid group. Classification and Regression Tree 
(CART) analysis determined which variables best predicted trajectory class 
membership using a number of variables available to clinicians.
RESULTS: GMMs found two trajectory classes (C1, C2) each for amyloid-positive 
(P; n=722) and negative (N; n=470) groups. Most (90%) in the negative group were 
C2N with mildly impaired baseline ADAS-Cog13, normal FAQ and nonprogression; 10% 
were C1N with moderately impaired baseline FAQ and ADAS-Cog13 and trajectory of 
moderately worsening scores on the FAQ. C1P (26%) had more impaired baseline FAQ 
and ADAS-Cog13 than C2P (74%) and a steeper declining trajectory. CART yielded 4 
decision nodes (FAQ <10.5, FAQ <6.5, MMSE ≥26.5, age <75.5) in positive and 1 
node (FAQ <6.5) in negative groups, with 91.4% and 92.8% accuracy for class 
assignments, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The trajectory pattern of greater decline in amyloid positive 
subjects was predicted by greater baseline impairment of cognition and function. 
While most amyloid-negative subjects had nonprogression irrespective of their 
diagnosis, a subgroup declined similarly to the gradually declining 
amyloid-positive group. CART predicted likely trajectory class, with known 
amyloid status, using variables accessible in a clinical setting, but needs 
replication.

Cardiovascular risk could be calculated using Qrisk2. It is suggested that 
cardiovascular risk factors influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, studies have not specifically evaluated the influence of 
cardiovascular risk using Qrisk2 on neuropathological progression and AD 
biomarkers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of cardiovascular 
risk factors using Qrisk2 on CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, 18F-AV45-PET, 
18F-FDG-PET, MRI, and cognitive measures in APOE4 negative cognitively normal 
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. 614 cognitively normal, early, and 
late MCI subjects were selected from the ADNI cohort with a 2-year follow-up. 
CSF Aβ and tau, 18F-AV45-PET, 18F-FDG-PET, MRI, and cognitive measures along 
with modified Qrisk2 were evaluated. APOE4 non-carrier, high cardiovascular risk 
sub-group of early and late MCI and cognitively normal subjects, demonstrated 
worse biomarker and cognitive profile at baseline and during follow up compared 
to low cardiovascular risk group. Additionally, similar pattern was also 
observed in APOE4 carriers. We demonstrated that Qrisk2 and APOE4 were 
independent predictors of biomarker and clinical progression in AD trajectory. 
High cardiovascular risk is associated with biomarker changes in APOE4 
non-carriers in prodromal AD, which may suggest that treatment of cardiovascular 
risk is an effective prevention strategy even in APOE4 negative subjects and may 
influence disease progression independent of amyloid pathology. Demonstration of 
accelerated neuropathological changes in both APOE4 carriers and non-carriers 
suggest that focusing on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is an effective 
preventative strategy while we eagerly waiting for new treatments.

Exploring individual hallmarks of brain ageing is important. Here, we propose 
the age-related glucose metabolism pattern (ARGMP) as a potential index to 
characterize brain ageing in cognitively normal (CN) elderly people. We 
collected 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET brain images from two independent 
cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N = 127) and the 
Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China (N = 84). During 
follow-up (mean 80.60 months), 23 participants in the ADNI cohort converted to 
cognitive impairment. ARGMPs were identified using the scaled subprofile 
model/principal component analysis method, and cross-validations were conducted 
in both independent cohorts. A survival analysis was further conducted to 
calculate the predictive effect of conversion risk by using ARGMPs. The results 
showed that ARGMPs were characterized by hypometabolism with increasing age 
primarily in the bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate and 
paracingulate gyri, caudate nucleus, and left supplementary motor area and 
hypermetabolism in part of the left inferior cerebellum. The expression network 
scores of ARGMPs were significantly associated with chronological age 
(R = 0.808, p < 0.001), which was validated in both the ADNI and Xuanwu cohorts. 
Individuals with higher network scores exhibited a better predictive effect (HR: 
0.30, 95% CI: 0.1340 ~ 0.6904, p = 0.0068). These findings indicate that ARGMPs 
derived from CN participants may represent a novel index for characterizing 
brain ageing and predicting high conversion risk into cognitive impairment.

Accurately identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals who will 
progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is very important for making early 
interventions. Many classification methods focus on integrating multiple imaging 
modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). However, the main challenge for MCI 
classification using multiple imaging modalities is the existence of a lot of 
missing data in many subjects. For example, in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, almost half of the subjects do not have 
PET images. In this paper, we propose a new and flexible binary classification 
method, namely Multi-task Linear Programming Discriminant (MLPD) analysis, for 
the incomplete multi-source feature learning. Specifically, we decompose the 
classification problem into different classification tasks, i.e., one for each 
combination of available data sources. To solve all different classification 
tasks jointly, our proposed MLPD method links them together by constraining them 
to achieve the similar estimated mean difference between the two classes (under 
classification) for those shared features. Compared with the state-of-the-art 
incomplete Multi-Source Feature (iMSF) learning method, instead of constraining 
different classification tasks to choose a common feature subset for those 
shared features, MLPD can flexibly and adaptively choose different feature 
subsets for different classification tasks. Furthermore, our proposed MLPD 
method can be efficiently implemented by linear programming. To validate our 
MLPD method, we perform experiments on the ADNI baseline dataset with the 
incomplete MRI and PET images from 167 progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects and 226 
stable MCI (sMCI) subjects. We further compared our method with the iMSF method 
(using incomplete MRI and PET images) and also the single-task classification 
method (using only MRI or only subjects with both MRI and PET images). 
Experimental results show very promising performance of our proposed MLPD 
method.

Increasingly, clinical trials are being planned in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to prevent or delay the onset of dementia in Alzheimer disease 
(AD) by disease-modifying intervention. Inclusion of imaging techniques as 
biomarkers for patient selection and assessment of outcome is expected to 
increase trial efficacy. PET using (18)F-FDG provides objective information 
about the impairment of synaptic function and could, with appropriate 
standardization, qualify as a biomarker.
METHODS: We evaluated a predefined quantitative measure (PET score) that is 
extracted automatically from (18)F-FDG PET scans using a sample of controls (n = 
44), patients with MCI (n = 94), and patients with mild AD (n = 40) from the 
Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Subjects received 4 scans and 
clinical assessments over 2 y.
RESULTS: PET scores provide much higher test-retest reliability than standard 
neuropsychologic test scores (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
[ADAS-cog] and Mini-Mental State Examination) and superior signal strength for 
measuring progression. At the same time, they are related linearly to ADAS-cog 
scores, thus providing a valid measure of cognitive impairment. In addition, PET 
scores at study entry in MCI patients significantly predict clinical progression 
to dementia with a higher accuracy than Mini-Mental State Examination and 
ADAS-cog.
CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET scores are a valid imaging biomarker to monitor the 
progression of MCI to AD. Their superior test-retest reliability and signal 
strength will allow the reduction in the number of subjects needed or shortening 
of study duration substantially.

Many recent imaging genetic studies focus on detecting the associations between 
genetic markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative 
traits (QTs). Although there exist a large number of generalized multivariate 
regression analysis methods, few of them have used diagnosis information in 
subjects to enhance the analysis performance. In addition, few of models have 
investigated the identification of multi-modality phenotypic patterns associated 
with interesting genotype groups in traditional methods. To reveal 
disease-relevant imaging genetic associations, we propose a novel 
diagnosis-guided multi-modality (DGMM) framework to discover multi-modality 
imaging QTs that are associated with both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its top 
genetic risk factor (i.e., APOE SNP rs429358). The strength of our proposed 
method is that it explicitly models the priori diagnosis information among 
subjects in the objective function for selecting the disease-relevant and robust 
multi-modality QTs associated with the SNP. We evaluate our method on two 
modalities of imaging phenotypes, i.e., those extracted from structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) data and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only 
achieves better performances under the metrics of root mean squared error and 
correlation coefficient but also can identify common informative regions of 
interests (ROIs) across multiple modalities to guide the disease-induced 
biological interpretation, compared with other reference methods.

Classification of Alzheimer's disease from FDG-PET images using favourite class 
ensembles.

Cabral C, Silveira M; Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

Classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) 
from brain images using machine learning methods has become popular. Although 
the large majority of the existing techniques rely on a single classifier such 
as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), several ensemble methods such as Adaboost 
or Random Forests (RF) have also been explored. The ensemble methods combine the 
outputs of several classifiers and aim to increase performance by exploring the 
diversity of the base classifiers in terms of features or examples, which are 
usually randomly selected. In this paper we propose using a different kind of 
ensemble to address the three class problem of classifying AD, MCI and Control 
Normals (CN) from PET brain images. We propose the favourite class ensemble of 
classifiers where each base classifier in the ensemble uses a different feature 
subset which is optimized for a given class. Since different image features 
correspond to different sets of brain voxels, the proposed favourite class 
classifiers are able to take into account the fact that the spatial pattern of 
brain degeneration in AD changes in time as the disease progresses. We tested 
this approach on FDG-PET images from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database using as base classifiers both Support Vector 
Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). The ensembles systematically 
outperformed the corresponding single classifier with the best result (66.78%) 
being obtained by the SVM ensemble.

ABCA7 gene has been identified as a strong genetic locus for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) susceptibility in genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, the 
possible roles of ABCA7 variants in AD pathology were not specifically assessed. 
Using tagger methods, we extracted 15 targeted ABCA7 loci to investigate their 
associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers in 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Finally, although we 
did not detect any significant associations of previously published GWAS SNPs 
(rs3764650 and rs78117248) with all the CSF (Aβ1 - 42, T-tau, and P-tau) and 
neuroimaging markers, three other variants (rs3752242, rs3752240, and rs4147912) 
at ABCA7 loci were detected to show significant associations with amyloid 
deposition on AV-45 PET in brain. Moreover, haplotype and subgroup analysis 
confirmed these significant findings. Furthermore, there were no remarkable 
correlations between ABCA7 variants and neuronal degeneration biomarkers 
(elevated CSF tau, brain structure atrophy, and hypometabolism on imaging) in 
this study. Thus, our study suggested that ABCA7 genotypes contribute to the AD 
risk through involvement in amyloid-β deposition on in vivo imaging, but not in 
tau pathology, brain atrophy, or decreased glucose metabolism.

Recent advances in biomarker studies compiled from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are summarized here. CSF Aβ42, total tau, and 
phosphorylated tau181 are the most sensitive biomarkers for diagnosing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting the onset of AD in cases with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Many perspective studies on PiB-PET, 
FDG-PET, MRI volumetry, and some neuropsychiatric tests have provided evidence 
for the usefulness of these biomarkers for diagnosing AD and MCI due to AD. 
Basic and clinical studies have contributed considerably to the establishment of 
clinical evidence that supports the usefulness of these markers. Given the 
progress in the diagnosis of preclinical AD, discovery of therapy that is 
essential for the cure of AD is expected soon.

The objective of this study was to assess the ability of a quantitative 
software-aided approach to improve the diagnostic accuracy of 18F FDG PET for 
Alzheimer's dementia over visual analysis alone. Twenty normal subjects 
(M:F-12:8; mean age 80.6 years) and twenty mild AD subjects (M:F-12:8; mean age 
70.6 years) with 18F FDG PET scans were obtained from the ADNI database. Three 
blinded readers interpreted these PET images first using a visual qualitative 
approach and then using a quantitative software-aided approach. Images were 
classified on two five-point scales based on normal/abnormal (1-definitely 
normal; 5-definitely abnormal) and presence of AD (1-definitely not AD; 
5-definitely AD). Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for both 
approaches were compared based on the aforementioned scales. The sensitivity, 
specificity, and accuracy for the normal vs. abnormal readings of all readers 
combined were higher when comparing the software-aided vs. visual approach 
(sensitivity 0.93 vs. 0.83 P = 0.0466; specificity 0.85 vs. 0.60 P = 0.0005; 
accuracy 0.89 vs. 0.72 P<0.0001). The specificity and accuracy for absence vs. 
presence of AD of all readers combined were higher when comparing the 
software-aided vs. visual approach (specificity 0.90 vs. 0.70 P = 0.0008; 
accuracy 0.81 vs. 0.72 P = 0.0356). Sensitivities of the software-aided and 
visual approaches did not differ significantly (0.72 vs. 0.73 P = 0.74). The 
quantitative software-aided approach appears to improve the performance of 18F 
FDG PET for the diagnosis of mild AD. It may be helpful for experienced 18F FDG 
PET readers analyzing challenging cases.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the predictive value of different classes of 
markers in the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) over an extended 4-year follow-up in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
METHODS: MCI patients were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG), and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers at baseline and were followed on a yearly 
basis for 4 years to ascertain progression to AD. Logistic regression models 
were fitted in clusters, including demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive 
markers, and biomarkers (morphometric, PET-FDG, CSF, amyloid-β, and tau).
RESULTS: The predictive model at 4 years revealed that two cognitive measures, 
an episodic memory measure and a Clock Drawing screening test, were the best 
predictors of conversion (area under the curve = 0.78).
CONCLUSIONS: This model of prediction is consistent with the previous model at 2 
years, thus highlighting the importance of cognitive measures in progression 
from MCI to AD. Cognitive markers were more robust predictors than biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Being clinically diagnosed with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely studied. Yet, the clinical and 
structural neuroimaging characteristics for prodromal AD, which are defined as 
A+T+MCI based on the AT (N) system are still highly desirable. This study 
evaluates the differences of the cognitive assessments and structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) between the early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) 
participants based on the AT (N) system. The potential clinical value of the 
structural MRI as a predictor of cognitive decline during follow-up in prodromal 
AD is further investigated.
METHODS: A total of 406 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were chosen and dichotomized into EMCI 
and LMCI groups according to the Second Edition (Logical Memory II) Wechsler 
Memory Scale. Multiple markers' data was collected, including age, sex, years of 
education, ApoE4 status, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, standardized 
uptake values ratios (SUVR) means of florbetapir-PET-AV45, cognitive measures, 
and structural MRI. We chose 197 A+T+MCI participants (prodromal AD) with 
positive biomarkers of Aβ plaques (labeled "A") and fibrillar tau (labeled "T"). 
We diagnosed Aβ plaques positive by the SUVR means of florbetapir-PET-AV45 
(cut-off >1.1) and fibrillar tau positive by CSF phosphorylated-tau at threonine 
181 (p-tau) (cut-off >23 pg/mL). The differences of cognitive assessments and 
regions of interest (ROIs) defined on the MRI template between EMCI and LMCI 
were compared. Furthermore, the potential clinical utility of the MRI as the 
predictor of cognitive decline in prodromal AD was evaluated by investigating 
the relationship between baseline MRI markers and cognition decline at the 
follow-up period, through a linear regression model.
RESULTS: The LMCI participants had a significantly more amyloid burden and CSF 
levels of total t-tau than the EMCI participants. The LMCI participants scored a 
lower result than the EMCI group in the global cognition scales and subscales 
which included tests for memory, delayed recall memory, executive function, 
language, attention and visuospatial skills. The cognition levels declined 
faster in the LMCI participants during the 12- and 24-month follow-up. There 
were significant differences in ROIs on the structural MRI between the two 
groups, including a bilateral entorhinal, a bilateral hippocampus, a bilateral 
amygdala, a bilateral lateral ventricle and cingulate, a corpus callosum, and a 
left temporal. The thickness average of the left entorhinal, the left middle 
temporal, the left superior temporal, and the right isthmus cingulate was a main 
contributor to the decreased global cognition levels. The thickness average of 
the left superior temporal and bilateral entorhinal played a key role in the 
memory domain decline. The thickness average of the left middle temporal, and 
the right isthmus cingulate was significantly associated with an executive 
function decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the AT (N) system, surely, both the EMCI and LMCI 
diagnoses presented significant differences in multiple cognition domains. 
Signature ROIs from the structural MRI tests had correlated a cognitive decline, 
and could act as one potential predictive marker.

The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is the most important genetic risk 
factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms 
responsible for it remain controversial. We used the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to examine the influence of APOE ε4 dose 
on clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers across the AD spectrum (from cognitive 
normal to AD patients with severe cognitive impairment). A total of 1718 
participants from the ADNI cohort were selected, and we evaluated the impact of 
ε4 dose on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels' Abeta1-42 (Aβ1-42), tau, and 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau); cortical amyloid deposition (Florbetapir-PET-AV45); 
brain atrophy (MRI); brain metabolism (FDG-PET); hippocampal metabolism; and 
cognitive declines, through different cognitive subgroups. We found that (1) ε4 
was associated with decreased CSF beta-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and increased cerebral 
Aβ deposition across the AD spectrum; (2) increased CSF tau, P-tau and cerebral 
hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, and cognition decline were all associated 
with APOE ε4 in prodromal AD stage; (3) increased CSF tau, P-tau and cerebral 
hypometabolism appear to begin earlier than hippocampal atrophy and cognitive 
decline. We hypothesized that APOE ε4 increases cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) 
deposition in all the stages of AD development, and also influences Aβ-initiated 
cascade of downstream neurodegenerative effects, thereby increasing the risk of 
AD.

AIM: The value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET for the prognosis of 
conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is 
controversial. In the present work, the identification of cerebral metabolic 
patterns with significant prognostic value for conversion of MCI patients to AD 
is investigated with voxel-based Cox regression, which in contrast to common 
categorical comparisons also utilizes time information.
METHODS: FDG PET data of 544 MCI patients from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were randomly split into two 
equally-sized datasets (training and test). Within a median follow-up duration 
of 47 months (95% CI: 46-48 months) 181 patients developed AD. In the training 
dataset, voxel-wise Cox regressions were used to identify regions associated 
with conversion of MCI to AD. These were compared to regions identified by a 
classical group comparison (analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with statistical 
parametric mapping (SPM) 8) between converters and non-converters (both adjusted 
for apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) 
score, age, sex and education). In the test dataset, normalized FDG uptake 
within significant brain regions from voxel-wise Cox- and ANCOVA analyses (Cox- 
and ANCOVA- regions of interest (ROI), respectively) and clinical variables APOE 
status, MMSE score and education were tested in different Cox models (adjusted 
for age, sex) including: (1) only clinical variables, (2) only normalized FDG 
uptake in ANCOVA-ROI, (3) only normalized FDG uptake from Cox-ROI, (4) clinical 
variables plus FDG uptake in ANCOVA-ROI, (5) clinical variables plus FDG uptake 
from Cox-ROI.
RESULTS: Conversion-related regions with relative hypometabolism comprised parts 
of the temporo-parietal and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus for voxel-wise 
ANCOVA, plus frontal regions for voxel-wise Cox regression (both p < .01, false 
discovery rate (FDR) corrected). The clinical-only model (1) and the models 
based on normalized FDG uptake from Cox-ROI only (2) and ANCOVA-ROI only (3) all 
significantly predicted conversion to AD (Wald Test (WT): p < .001). The 
clinical model (1) was significantly improved by adding imaging information in 
model (4) (Akaike information criterion (AIC) relative likelihood (RL) (1) vs 
(4): RL < 0.018). There were no significant differences between models (2) and 
(3), as well as (4) and (5).
CONCLUSIONS: Voxel-wise Cox regression identifies conversion-related patterns of 
cerebral glucose metabolism, but is not superior to classical group contrasts in 
this regard. With imaging information from both FDG PET patterns, the prediction 
of conversion to AD was improved.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with 
changes in multiple neuroimaging and biological measures. These may provide 
complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. We present a 
multi-modality classification framework in which manifolds are constructed based 
on pairwise similarity measures derived from random forest classifiers. 
Similarities from multiple modalities are combined to generate an embedding that 
simultaneously encodes information about all the available features. 
Multi-modality classification is then performed using coordinates from this 
joint embedding. We evaluate the proposed framework by application to 
neuroimaging and biological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Features include regional MRI volumes, voxel-based FDG-PET 
signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. 
Classification based on the joint embedding constructed using information from 
all four modalities out-performs the classification based on any individual 
modality for comparisons between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy 
controls, as well as between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy 
controls. Based on the joint embedding, we achieve classification accuracies of 
89% between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, and 75% between 
mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. These results are 
comparable with those reported in other recent studies using multi-kernel 
learning. Random forests provide consistent pairwise similarity measures for 
multiple modalities, thus facilitating the combination of different types of 
feature data. We demonstrate this by application to data in which the number of 
features differs by several orders of magnitude between modalities. Random 
forest classifiers extend naturally to multi-class problems, and the framework 
described here could be applied to distinguish between multiple patient groups 
in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Brain atrophy measured by structural imaging has been used to 
quantify resilience against neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. 
Considering glucose hypometabolism is another marker of neurodegeneration, we 
quantified metabolic resilience (MR) based on Fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (FDG PET) and investigated its clinical implications.
METHODS: We quantified the MR and other resilience metrics, including brain 
resilience (BR) and cognitive resilience (CR), using partial least squares path 
modeling from the ADNI database. A linear mixed-effects model and a Cox 
proportional hazards model were used to identify the impact of each resilience 
on longitudinal cognitive function and conversion to dementia, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 848 participants were included in this study. All resilience 
metrics (CR, BR, and MR) were associated with slower cognitive decline. Results 
from the ANOVA test, AIC and BIC values showed that the additional inclusion of 
MR improved the performances of the linear mixed effect models. In survival 
analysis, all resilience variables were negatively associated with the risk of 
conversion to dementia. In line with the results of the linear mixed effects 
models, the additional inclusion of MR into the models with different resilience 
variables increased the C-index.
CONCLUSION: Relative preservation of brain glucose metabolism is a valuable 
predictor of future cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, adding value 
to existing resilience metrics. While the utility of FDG PET in clinical 
settings is limited by cost and accessibility, it might have potential 
usefulness as a prognostic marker, especially in a context of resilience.

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose 
(FDG) have identified a well-defined pattern of glucose hypometabolism in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The assessment of the metabolic relationship among 
brain regions has the potential to provide unique information regarding the 
disease process. Previous studies of metabolic correlation patterns have 
demonstrated alterations in AD subjects relative to age-matched, healthy control 
subjects. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between 
β-amyloid, apolipoprotein E ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4) genotype, and metabolic correlations 
patterns in subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mild 
cognitive impairment subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) study were categorized into β-amyloid-low and β-amyloid-high 
groups, based on quantitative analysis of [18F]florbetapir PET scans, and APOE 
ɛ4 non-carriers and carriers based on genotyping. We generated voxel-wise 
metabolic correlation strength maps across the entire cerebral cortex for each 
group, and, subsequently, performed a seed-based analysis. We found that the 
APOE ɛ4 genotype was closely related to regional glucose hypometabolism, while 
elevated, fibrillar β-amyloid burden was associated with specific derangements 
of the metabolic correlation patterns.

While the ApoE ε4 allele is a known risk factor for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease, brain region specific effects remain elusive. In 
this study, we investigate whether the ApoE ε4 allele exhibits brain region 
specific effects in longitudinal glucose uptake among patients with MCI from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Preprocessed FDG PET images, 
MRIs, and demographic information were downloaded from the ADNI database. An 
iterative reblurred Van Cittertiteration method was used for partial volume 
correction (PVC) on all PET images. Structural MRIs were used for PET spatial 
normalization and region of interest (ROI) definition in standard space. 
Longitudinal changes in ROI FDG standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) relative 
to cerebellum in 24 ApoE ε4 carriers and 24 age-matched ApoE ε4 non-carriers 
were measured for up to 84-months (median 72 months, SD = 11.2 months) and 
compared using a generalized linear mixed effects model controlling for gender, 
education, baseline age, and follow-up period. Additionally, voxelwise analysis 
was performed by implementing a paired t-test comparing matched baseline and 
72 month FDG SUVR images in ApoE carriers and non-carriers separately. Results 
with PVC were compared with ones from non-PVC based analysis. After applying 
PVC, the superior fontal, parietal, lateral temporal, medial temporal, caudate, 
thalamus, and post-cingulate, and amygdala regions had greater longitudinal 
decreases in FDG uptake in ApoE ε4 carriers with MCI compared to non-carriers 
with MCI. Similar forebrain and limbic clusters were found through voxelwise 
analysis. Compared to the PVC based analysis, fewer significant ApoE-associated 
regions and clusters were found in the non-PVC based PET analysis. Our findings 
suggest that the ApoE ε4 genotype is associated with a longitudinal decline in 
glucose uptake in 8 forebrain and limbic brain regions in the context of MCI. In 
conclusion, this 84-months longitudinal FDG PET study demonstrates a novel ApoE 
ε4-associated brain-region specific glucose metabolism pattern in patients with 
MCI. Partial volume correction improved FDG PET quantification.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most prevalent cause of dementia and no cure has 
been discovered. Although the framework of AD clinical trials is being 
established utilizing results of large-scale observational studies such as the 
AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Japanese-ADNI (J-ADNI), the 
development of disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not 
yet been achieved. Preclinical AD was recently defined as a new disease stage in 
which AD is asymptomatic but biomarkers suggest the presence of amyloid 
pathology. Preclinical AD has been focused as promising therapeutic time window 
and establishment of reliable biomarkers for preclinical AD is an urgent task. 
The Japanese Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) preclinical 
study is a nationwide multicenter observational study carried out by public 
research funding from AMED as a successor to the J-ADNI study. The goal of this 
study is to establish a biomarker that can quantitatively evaluate the disease 
progression of preclinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or predict the 
progression to MCI and dementia in the future. To achieve this goal, the 
following assessments will be conducted over time for three years: clinical 
evaluations; cognitive tests; genetic testing; body fluid biomarker tests; and 
imaging biomarker studies such as MRI, FDG-PET, and amyloid PET. The obtained 
data will eventually be released to the public database.

The choroid plexus (ChP) is a major source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
production, with a direct and indirect role in protein clearance, and 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested the link between the 
ChP volume and levels of CSF proteins in 2 data sets of (i) healthy controls, 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 509), and (ii) healthy controls and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers 
Initiative (N = 302). All patients had baseline CSF proteins (amyloid-β, total 
and phosphorylated-tau and α-synuclein (only in Parkinson's Progression Markers 
Initiative)). ChP was automatically segmented on 3T structural T1-weighted MRIs. 
We found negative associations between ChP volume and CSF proteins, which were 
stronger in healthy controls, early-MCI patients, and PD patients compared with 
late-MCI and AD patients. Further grouping of patients of ADNI dataset into 
amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative based on their florbetapir (AV45) PET 
imaging showed that the association between ChP volume and CSF proteins 
(t/p-tau) was lower in amyloid-positive group. Our findings support the possible 
role of ChP in the clearance of CSF proteins, provide evidence for ChP 
dysfunction in AD, and suggest the need to account for the ChP volume in future 
studies of CSF-based biomarkers.

Many machine learning and pattern classification methods have been applied to 
the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, rather than predicting categorical 
variables as in classification, several pattern regression methods have also 
been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, 
most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables 
separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information 
among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression 
methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is 
often used, without considering the complementary information that can be 
provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general 
methodology, namely multi-modal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict 
multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only 
the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable 
used for classification, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of 
different variables. Specifically, our method contains two key components, i.e., 
(1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant 
features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal 
support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all 
modalities to predict multiple (regression and classification) variables. To 
validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, 
FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI 
patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the first set of experiments, we 
estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as 
one categorical variable (with value of 'AD', 'MCI' or 'HC'), from the baseline 
MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. In the second set of experiments, we predict the 
2-year changes of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores and also the conversion of MCI to AD 
from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The results on both sets of 
experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3T learning scheme can achieve better 
performance on both regression and classification tasks than the conventional 
learning methods.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different biomarkers for AD may potentially be 
complementary in diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Our aim was to combine MR 
imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers in the diagnostic classification and 2-year 
prognosis of MCI and AD, by examining the following: 1) which measures are most 
sensitive to diagnostic status, 2) to what extent the methods provide unique 
information in diagnostic classification, and 3) which measures are most 
predictive of clinical decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADNI baseline MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 42 
controls, 73 patients with MCI, and 38 patients with AD; and 2-year clinical 
follow-up data for 36 controls, 51 patients with MCI, and 25 patients with AD 
were analyzed. The hippocampus and entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial, 
precuneus, inferior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, lateral, and 
medial orbitofrontal cortices were used as regions of interest. CSF variables 
included Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/Abeta42 and p-tau/Abeta42. 
Regression analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of measures to 
diagnostic status as well as 2-year change in CDR-SB, MMSE, and delayed logical 
memory in MCI.
RESULTS: Hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/Abeta42 uniquely 
predicted diagnostic group. Change in CDR-SB was best predicted by retrosplenial 
thickness; MMSE, by retrosplenial metabolism and thickness; and delayed logical 
memory, by hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: All biomarkers were sensitive to the diagnostic group. Combining MR 
imaging morphometry and CSF biomarkers improved diagnostic classification 
(controls versus AD). MR imaging morphometry and PET were largely overlapping in 
value for discrimination. Baseline MR imaging and PET measures were more 
predictive of clinical change in MCI than were CSF measures.

PURPOSE: Argentina-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (Arg-ADNI) is the 
first ADNI study to be performed in Latin America at a medical center with the 
appropriate infrastructure. Our objective was to describe baseline 
characteristics and to examine whether biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) physiopathology were associated with worse memory performance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen controls and 28 mild cognitive impairment and 13 
AD dementia subjects were included. For Arg-ADNI, all biomarker parameters and 
neuropsychological tests of ADNI-II were adopted. Results of positron emission 
tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB-PET) 
were available from all participants. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker results were 
available from 39 subjects.
RESULTS: A total of 56 participants were included and underwent baseline 
evaluation. The three groups were similar with respect to years of education and 
sex, and they differed in age (F=5.10, P=0.01). Mean scores for the baseline 
measurements of the neuropsychological evaluation differed significantly among 
the three groups at P<0.001, showing a continuum in their neuropsychological 
performance. No significant correlations were found between the principal 
measures (long-delay recall, C-Pittsburgh compound-B scan, left hippocampal 
volume, and APOEε4) and either age, sex, or education (P>0.1). Baseline amyloid 
deposition and left hippocampal volume separated the three diagnostic groups and 
correlated with the memory performance (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data revealed links between 
cognition, structural changes, and biomarkers. Follow-up of a larger and more 
representative cohort, particularly analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and brain 
biomarkers, will allow better characterization of AD in our country.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by various 
pathological changes. Utilizing multimodal data from Fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography(FDG-PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the brain 
can offer comprehensive information about the lesions from different 
perspectives and improve the accuracy of prediction. However, there are 
significant differences in the feature space of multimodal data. Commonly, the 
simple concatenation of multimodal features can cause the model to struggle in 
distinguishing and utilizing the complementary information between different 
modalities, thus affecting the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, we propose an 
AD prediction model based on de-correlation constraint and multi-modal feature 
interaction. This model consists of the following three parts: (1) The feature 
extractor employs residual connections and attention mechanisms to capture 
distinctive lesion features from FDG-PET and MRI data within their respective 
modalities. (2) The de-correlation constraint function enhances the model's 
capacity to extract complementary information from different modalities by 
reducing the feature similarity between them. (3) The mutual attention feature 
fusion module interacts with the features within and between modalities to 
enhance the modal-specific features and adaptively adjust the weights of these 
features based on information from other modalities. The experimental results on 
ADNI database demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy 
of 86.79% for AD, MCI and NC, which is higher than the existing multi-modal AD 
prediction models.

BACKGROUND: Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid with 
Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and Aβ42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF 
Aβ42) demonstrate a highly significant inverse correlation. Both these 
techniques are presumed to measure brain Aβ amyloid load. The objectives of this 
study were to develop a method to transform CSF Aβ42 measures into calculated 
PIB measures (PIBcalc) of Aβ amyloid load, and to partially validate the method 
in an independent sample of subjects.
METHODS: In all, 41 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) underwent PIB PET imaging and lumbar puncture (LP) at the same 
time. This sample, referred to as the "training" sample (nine cognitively normal 
subjects, 22 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 subjects with 
Alzheimer's disease), was used to develop a regression model by which CSF Aβ42 
(with apolipoprotein E ɛ4 carrier status as a covariate) was transformed into 
units of PIB PET (PIBcalc). An independent "supporting" sample of 362 ADNI 
subjects (105 cognitively normal subjects, 164 subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment, and 93 subjects with Alzheimer's disease) who underwent LP but not 
PIB PET imaging had their CSF Aβ42 values converted to PIBcalc. These values 
were compared with the overall PIB PET distribution found in the ADNI subjects 
(n=102).
RESULTS: A linear regression model demonstrates good prediction of actual PIB 
PET from CSF Aβ42 measures obtained in the training sample (R(2)=0.77, P<.001). 
PIBcalc data (derived from CSF Aβ42) in the supporting sample of 362 ADNI 
subjects who underwent LP but not PIB PET imaging demonstrate group-wise 
distributions that are highly consistent with the larger ADNI PIB PET 
distribution and with published PIB PET imaging studies.
CONCLUSION: Although the precise parameters of this model are specific for the 
ADNI sample, we conclude that CSF Aβ42 can be transformed into PIBcalc measures 
of Aβ amyloid load. Brain Aβ amyloid load can be ascertained at baseline in 
therapeutic or observational studies by either CSF or amyloid PET imaging and 
the data can be pooled using well-established multiple imputation techniques 
that account for the uncertainty in a CSF-based PIBcalc value.

Multimodal classification methods using different modalities of imaging and 
non-imaging data have recently shown great advantages over traditional 
single-modality-based ones for diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), as well as its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
However, to the best of our knowledge, most existing methods focus on mining the 
relationship across multiple modalities of the same subjects, while ignoring the 
potentially useful relationship across different subjects. Accordingly, in this 
paper, we propose a novel learning method for multimodal classification of 
AD/MCI, by fully exploring the relationships across both modalities and 
subjects. Specifically, our proposed method includes two subsequent components, 
i.e., label-aligned multi-task feature selection and multimodal classification. 
In the first step, the feature selection learning from multiple modalities are 
treated as different learning tasks and a group sparsity regularizer is imposed 
to jointly select a subset of relevant features. Furthermore, to utilize the 
discriminative information among labeled subjects, a new label-aligned 
regularization term is added into the objective function of standard multi-task 
feature selection, where label-alignment means that all multi-modality subjects 
with the same class labels should be closer in the new feature-reduced space. In 
the second step, a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to fuse 
the selected features from multi-modality data for final classification. To 
validate our method, we perform experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using baseline MRI and FDG-PET imaging 
data. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 
better classification performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods 
for multimodal classification of AD/MCI.

The assessment of accuracy and robustness of multivariate analysis of FDG-PET 
brain images as presented in [Markiewicz, P.J., Matthews, J.C., Declerck, J., 
Herholz, K., 2009. Robustness of multivariate image analysis assessed by 
resampling techniques and applied to FDG-PET scans of patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. Neuroimage 46, 472-485.] using a homogeneous sample (from one centre) 
of small size is here verified using a heterogeneous sample (from multiple 
centres) of much larger size. Originally the analysis, which included principal 
component analysis (PCA) and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), was established 
using a sample of 42 subjects (19 Normal Controls (NCs) and 23 Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients) and here the analysis is verified using an independent 
sample of 166 subjects (86 NCs and 80 ADs) obtained from the ADNI database. It 
is shown that bootstrap resampling combined with the metric of the largest 
principal angle between PCA subspaces as well as the deliberate clinical 
misdiagnosis simulation can predict robustness of the multivariate analysis when 
used with new datasets. Cross-validation (CV) and the .632 bootstrap 
overestimated the predictive accuracy encouraging less robust solutions. Also, 
it is shown that the type of PET scanner and image reconstruction method has an 
impact on such analysis and affects the accuracy of the verification sample.

Machine learning methods pool diverse information to perform computer-assisted 
diagnosis and predict future clinical decline. We introduce a machine learning 
method to boost power in clinical trials. We created a Support Vector Machine 
algorithm that combines brain imaging and other biomarkers to classify 737 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) subjects as having 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal controls. 
We trained our classifiers based on example data including: MRI measures of 
hippocampal, ventricular, and temporal lobe volumes, a PET-FDG numerical 
summary, CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau, and Abeta(42)), ApoE genotype, age, sex, 
and body mass index. MRI measures contributed most to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
classification; PET-FDG and CSF biomarkers, particularly Abeta(42), contributed 
more to MCI classification. Using all biomarkers jointly, we used our classifier 
to select the one-third of the subjects most likely to decline. In this 
subsample, fewer than 40 AD and MCI subjects would be needed to detect a 25% 
slowing in temporal lobe atrophy rates with 80% power--a substantial boosting of 
power relative to standard imaging measures.

Dementia is a global epidemic with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the leading 
cause. Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming 
an international priority. Neocortical Aβ (extracellular β-amyloid) burden 
(NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such 
marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely 
available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible 
alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having 
efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for 
population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) 
and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the 
Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. 
Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures 
between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models 
were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged 
AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference 
between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based 
on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, 
respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded 
similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a 
panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting 
the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and Aβ 
accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based 
screen.

The Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study is a longitudinal 
study of 1112 volunteers from healthy, mild cognitive impairment, and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) populations who can be assessed and followed up for 
prospective research into aging and AD. AIBL aims to improve understanding of 
the pathogenesis, early clinical manifestation, and diagnosis of AD, and 
identify diet and lifestyle factors that influence the development of AD. For 
AIBL, the magnetic resonance imaging parameters of Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were adopted and the Pittsuburgh compound B 
((11)C-PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition and 
neuropsychological tests were designed to permit comparison and pooling with 
ADNI data. Differences to ADNI include assessment every 18-months, imaging in 
25% (magnetic resonance imaging, (11)C-PiB PET but no fluorodeoxyglucose PET), 
more comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and detailed collection of diet 
and lifestyle data. AIBL has completed the first 18-month follow-up and is 
making imaging and clinical data available through the ADNI website. 
Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data is revealing links between cognition, 
brain amyloid burden, structural brain changes, biomarkers, and lifestyle.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the influence of hypertension (HTN) status on 
longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism was modified by the 
apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) status among older people with normal cognition.
METHODS: In this study, we included 217 older individuals with normal cognition 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants 
were divided into the HTN and no HTN groups based on self-reported medical 
history. Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear mixed 
model was fitted to examine the association between the HTN × APOE4 interaction 
and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism after controlling for 
several covariates.
RESULTS: In the present study, we found that the association between HTN status 
and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism varied as a function of the 
APOE4 status, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG 
SUVR than all other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+). 
Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the rate of decline in FDG 
SUVR among other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+).
CONCLUSION: The APOE4 genotype interacted with hypertension status to affect 
longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism among older individual with 
normal cognition, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG 
SUVR than other groups.

The study objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain 
stimulation (DBS) at the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) region to 
specifically modulate frontal lobe behavioral and cognitive networks as a novel 
treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This is a 
non-randomized phase I prospective open label interventional trial of three 
subjects with matched comparison groups. AD participants given DBS for at least 
18 months at the VC/VS target were compared on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum 
of Boxes (CDR-SB), our primary outcome clinical measure, to matched groups 
without DBS from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Serial 
2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images 
of AD participants were also compared longitudinally over time. Three AD DBS 
participants were matched to subjects from the ADNI cohort. All participants 
tolerated DBS well without significant adverse events. All three AD DBS 
participants had less performance decline and two of them meaningfully less 
decline over time on our primary outcome measure, CDR-SB, relative to matched 
comparison groups from the ADNI using score trajectory slopes. Minimal changes 
or increased metabolism on FDG-PET were seen in frontal cortical regions after 
chronic DBS at the VC/VS target. The first use of DBS in AD at a frontal lobe 
behavior regulation target (VC/VS) was well-tolerated and revealed less 
performance decline in CDR-SB. Frontal network modulation to improve executive 
and behavioral deficits should be furthered studied in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent degenerative brain disease 
associated with dementia, requires early diagnosis to alleviate worsening of 
symptoms through appropriate management and treatment. Recent studies on AD 
stage classification are increasingly using multimodal data. However, few 
studies have applied graph neural networks to multimodal data comprising F-18 
florbetaben (FBB) amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) images and 
clinical indicators. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for AD stage classification 
using multimodal data, specifically FBB PET images and clinical indicators, 
collected from Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The effectiveness of GCN was demonstrated 
through comparisons with the support vector machine, random forest, and 
multilayer perceptron across four classification tasks (normal control (NC) vs. 
AD, NC vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI vs. AD). 
As input, all models received the same combined feature vectors, created by 
concatenating the PET imaging feature vectors extracted by the 3D dense 
convolutional network and non-imaging feature vectors consisting of clinical 
indicators using multimodal feature fusion method. An adjacency matrix for the 
population graph was constructed using cosine similarity or the Euclidean 
distance between subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and/or non-imaging 
feature vectors. The usage ratio of these different modal data and edge 
assignment threshold were tuned by setting them as hyperparameters. In this 
study, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com were the GCN models that received the adjacency 
matrix constructed using cosine similarity (CS) and the Euclidean distance (ED) 
between the subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and non-imaging feature 
vectors, respectively. In modified nested cross validation, GCN-CS-com and 
GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 98.40%, 94.58%, 
94.01%, 82.63% and 99.68%, 93.82%, 93.88%, 90.43% for the four aforementioned 
classification tasks using DAUH dataset, outperforming the other models. 
Furthermore, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test 
accuracies of 76.16% and 90.11% for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification using ADNI 
dataset, outperforming the other models. These results demonstrate that GCN 
could be an effective model for AD stage classification using multimodal data.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disease that presents a 
broad spectrum of clinicopathologic profiles. To date, objective subtyping of AD 
independent of disease progression using brain imaging has been required. Our 
study aimed to extract representations of unique brain metabolism patterns 
different from disease progression to identify objective subtypes of AD.
METHODS: A total of 3620 FDG brain PET images with AD, mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) were obtained from the ADNI database from 
1607 participants at enrollment and follow-up visits. A conditional variational 
autoencoder model was trained on FDG brain PET images of AD patients with the 
corresponding condition of AD severity score. The k-means algorithm was applied 
to generate clusters from the encoded representations. The trained deep 
learning-based cluster model was also transferred to FDG PET of MCI patients and 
predicted the prognosis of subtypes for conversion from MCI to AD. Spatial 
metabolism patterns, clinical and biological characteristics, and conversion 
rate from MCI to AD were compared across the subtypes.
RESULTS: Four distinct subtypes of spatial metabolism patterns in AD with 
different brain pathologies and clinical profiles were identified: (i) angular, 
(ii) occipital, (iii) orbitofrontal, and (iv) minimal hypometabolic patterns. 
The deep learning model was also successfully transferred for subtyping MCI, and 
significant differences in frequency (P < 0.001) and risk of conversion 
(log-rank P < 0.0001) from MCI to AD were observed across the subtypes, highest 
in S2 (35.7%) followed by S1 (23.4%).
CONCLUSION: We identified distinct subtypes of AD with different 
clinicopathologic features. The deep learning-based approach to distinguish AD 
subtypes on FDG PET could have implications for predicting individual outcomes 
and provide a clue to understanding the heterogeneous pathophysiology of AD.

Biomarkers, both biological and imaging, are indicators of specific changes that 
characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in vivo. Knowing the precise 
relationship between biomarkers and disease severity would allow for accurate 
disease staging and possible forecasting of decline. Jack et al. suggested as an 
initial hypothesis that this relationship be sigmoidal; the objective of this 
article is to determine, using large-scale population data from ADNI, the 
precise shape of this association. We considered six different models (linear; 
quadratic; robust quadratic; local quadratic regression; penalized B-spline; and 
sigmoid) and used the Akaike Information Criterion to gauge how well these 
models compare in conforming to the data. We included 576 subjects (229 
controls, 193 AD, and 154 mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to 
AD) from the ADNI study, for whom baseline data on cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 
(Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total-tau (t-tau), hippocampal volumes, 
and FDG-PET were available. Analysis of this cross-sectional dataset showed that 
a local quadratic regression model was 42% more likely than a sigmoid to be the 
best model for Aβ42. This ratio augments to 22% and 73% for Penalized B-Spline 
in the case of p-tau and t-tau, respectively; to 3500% for the linear model for 
FDG-PET; and to 6700% for the Penalized B-Spline for hippocampal volumes. 
Preliminary, cross-sectional evidence therefore indicates that the shape of the 
association with disease severity is non-linear and differs between biomarkers.

Residual vectors for Alzheimer disease diagnosis and prognostication.

Clark DG; Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative condition 
and a looming socioeconomic threat. A biomarker for the disease could make the 
process of diagnosis easier and more accurate, and accelerate drug discovery. 
The current work describes a method for scoring brain images that is inspired by 
fundamental principles from information retrieval (IR), a branch of computer 
science that includes the development of Internet search engines. For this 
research, a dataset of 254 baseline 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) scans was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For a given contrast, a subset of scans (nine of 
every 10) was used to compute a residual vector that typified the difference, at 
each voxel, between the two groups being contrasted. Scans that were not used 
for computing the residual vector (the remaining one of 10 scans) were then 
compared to the residual vector using a cosine similarity metric. This process 
was repeated sequentially, each time generating cosine similarity scores on 10% 
of the FDG-PET scans for each contrast. Statistical analysis revealed that the 
scores were significant predictors of functional decline as measured by the 
Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). When logistic regression models that 
incorporated these scores were evaluated with leave-one-out cross-validation, 
cognitively normal controls were discerned from AD with sensitivity and 
specificity of 94.4% and 84.8%, respectively. Patients who converted from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD were discerned from MCI nonconverters with 
sensitivity and specificity of 89.7% and 62.9%, respectively, when FAQ scores 
were brought into the model. Residual vectors are easy to compute and provide a 
simple method for scoring the similarity between an FDG-PET scan and sets of 
examples from a given diagnostic group. The method is readily generalizable to 
any imaging modality. Further interdisciplinary work between IR and clinical 
neuroscience is warranted.

One medical challenge in studying the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide mechanism for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is exploring the law of beta toxic oligomers' diffusion 
in human brains in vivo. One beneficial means of solving this problem is brain 
network analysis based on graph theory. In this study, the characteristics of Aβ 
functional brain networks of Healthy Control (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI), and AD groups were compared by applying graph theoretical analyses to 
Carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (11C 
PiB-PET) data. 120 groups of PiB-PET images from the ADNI database were 
analyzed. The results showed that the small-world property of MCI and AD were 
lost as compared to HC. Furthermore, the local clustering of networks was higher 
in both MCI and AD as compared to HC, whereas the path length was similar among 
the three groups. The results also showed that there could be four potential Aβ 
toxic oligomer seeds: Frontal_Sup_Medial_L, Parietal_Inf_L, Frontal_Med_Orb_R, 
and Parietal_Inf_R. These four seeds are corresponding to Regions of Interests 
referred by physicians to clinically diagnose AD.

Relative quantitative analysis of amyloid plaque burden in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) patients can be reported as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from 
positron emission tomography (PET). Here, the SUVR is the ratio of the mean 
amyloid radioligand retention in a composite (COMP) neocortical volume of 
interest (VOI) to that in a reference VOI, such as the cerebellum, brainstem 
(BST)/pons, or white matter (WM). Some longitudinal PET investigations show that 
the rate of amyloid accumulation to follow-up has an inverted U relationship 
with baseline amyloid SUVR relative to cerebellar or brainstem/pons reference 
VOIs. The corresponding association with SUVR relative to WM is unknown. To test 
the possible benefits of WM normalization, we analyzed [18F]-AV45 PET data from 
404 subjects in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database at baseline and 
2-year follow-up (144 cognitively normal controls, 225 patients with mild 
cognitive impairment, and 35 AD patients). Reference regions included 
subcortical WM as well as conventional cerebellar gray matter (CBL), and BST. We 
tested associations between each subject's inter-session change (∆) of SUVR and 
their baseline SUVR by applying linear, logarithmic, and quadratic regression 
analyses. Unscaled standardized uptake values (SUVs) were correlated between 
VOIs at baseline and follow-up, and within VOIs in the longitudinal run. The 
association between ∆SUVR and baseline SUVR relative to WM reference was best 
described by an inverted U-shaped function. Correlation analyses demonstrated a 
high regional and temporal correlation between COMP and WM VOI SUVs. For WM 
normalization, we confirm that the rate of amyloid accumulation over time 
follows an inverted U-shaped function of baseline amyloid burden. Reference 
region selection, however, has substantial effects on SUVR results. This 
reflects the extent of covariance between SUVs in the COMP VOI and those in the 
various reference VOIs. We speculate that PET labeling of amyloid deposition 
within target regions is partially confounded by effects of longitudinal changes 
of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on tracer delivery. Indeed, CBF may be the leading 
factor influencing longitudinal SUV changes. We suggest that SUVR relative to WM 
may be more robust to changes in CBF, and thus fitter for sensitive detection of 
amyloid accumulation in intervention studies.

In order to predict the risks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) based on the deep 
learning model of brain 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET), a total of 
350 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were selected as the research objects; 
in addition, the Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (CAFFE) 
was selected as the framework of the deep learning platform; the FDG PET image 
features of each participant were extracted by a deep convolution network model 
to construct the prediction and classification models; therefore, the MCI stage 
features were classified and the transformation was predicted. The results 
showed that in terms of the MCI transformation prediction, the sensitivity and 
specificity of conv3 classification were respectively 91.02% and 77.63%; in 
terms of the Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) and Early Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (EMCI) classification, the accuracy of conv5 classification was 
72.19%, and the sensitivity and specificity of conv5 were all 73% approximately. 
Thus, it was seen that the model constructed in the research could be used to 
solve the problems of MCI transformation prediction, which also had certain 
effects on the classifications of EMCI and LMCI. The risk prediction of AD based 
on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research 
matched the expected results. It provided a relatively accurate reference model 
for the prediction of AD. Despite the deficiencies of the research process, the 
research results have provided certain references and guidance for the future 
exploration of accurate AD prediction model; therefore, the research is of great 
significance.

It has been hypothesized that the relatively rare autosomal dominant Alzheimer 
disease (ADAD) may be a useful model of the more frequent, sporadic, late-onset 
AD (LOAD). Individuals with ADAD have a predictable age at onset and the 
biomarker profile of ADAD participants in the preclinical stage may be used to 
predict disease progression and clinical onset. However, the extent to which the 
pathogenesis and neuropathology of ADAD overlaps with that of LOAD is equivocal. 
To address this uncertainty, two multicenter longitudinal observational studies, 
the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Dominantly 
Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), leveraged the expertise and resources of the 
existing Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington 
University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, to establish a 
Neuropathology Core (NPC). The ADNI/DIAN-NPC is systematically examining the 
brains of all participants who come to autopsy at the 59 ADNI sites in the USA 
and Canada and the 14 DIAN sites in the USA (eight), Australia (three), UK (one) 
and Germany (two). By 2014, 41 ADNI and 24 DIAN autopsies (involving nine 
participants and 15 family members) had been performed. The autopsy rate in the 
ADNI cohort in the most recent year was 93% (total since NPC inception: 70%). In 
summary, the ADNI/DIAN NPC has implemented a standard protocol for all sites to 
solicit permission for brain autopsy and to send brain tissue to the NPC for a 
standardized, uniform and state-of-the-art neuropathologic assessment. The 
benefit to ADNI and DIAN of the implementation of the NPC is very clear. The NPC 
provides final "gold standard" neuropathological diagnoses and data against 
which the antecedent observations and measurements of ADNI and DIAN can be 
compared.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage from normal 
aging to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corresponds to a higher risk of developing 
AD. Thus, it is necessary to explore and predict the onset of AD in MCI stage. 
In this study, we propose a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) 
and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to investigate 
promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion among 126 MCI converters 
and 108 MCI non-converters from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, we extracted 
brain networks from AD and normal control groups via ICA and then constructed 
Cox models that included network-based neuroimaging factors for the MCI group. 
We carried out five separate Cox analyses and the two-modality neuroimaging Cox 
model identified three significant network-based risk factors with higher 
prediction performance (accuracy = 73.50%) than those in either single-modality 
model (accuracy = 68.80%). Additionally, the results of the comprehensive Cox 
model, including significant neuroimaging factors and clinical variables, 
demonstrated that MCI individuals with reduced gray matter volume in a temporal 
lobe-related network of structural MRI [hazard ratio (HR) = 8.29E-05 (95% 
confidence interval (CI), 5.10E- 07 ~ 0.013)], low glucose metabolism in the 
posterior default mode network based on FDG-PET [HR = 0.066 (95% CI, 4.63E-03 ~ 
0.928)], positive apolipoprotein E ε4-status [HR = 1. 988 (95% CI, 1.531 ~ 
2.581)], increased Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 
scores [HR = 1.100 (95% CI, 1.059 ~ 1.144)] and Sum of Boxes of Clinical 
Dementia Rating scores [HR = 1.622 (95% CI, 1.364 ~ 1.930)] were more likely to 
convert to AD within 36 months after baselines. These significant risk factors 
in such comprehensive Cox model had the best prediction ability (accuracy = 
84.62%, sensitivity = 86.51%, specificity = 82.41%) compared to either 
neuroimaging factors or clinical variables alone. These results suggested that a 
combination of ICA and Cox model analyses could be used successfully in survival 
analysis and provide a network-based perspective of MCI progression or 
AD-related studies.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 is a protective genetic factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the potential interaction effects between the 
APOE ε2 allele and disease status on the intrinsic brain activity remain 
elusive.
METHODS: We identified 73 healthy control (HC) with APOE ε3/ε3, 61 mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with APOE ε3/ε3, 24 HC with APOE ε2/ε3, and 
10 MCI subjects with APOE ε2/ε3 from the ADNI database. All subjects underwent a 
resting-state functional MRI and Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET). We used a fractional amplitude of low-frequency 
fluctuation (fALFF) to explore the spontaneous brain activity. Based on the 
mixed-effects analysis, we explored the interaction effects between the APOE ε2 
allele versus disease status on brain activity and metabolism in a voxel-wise 
fashion (GRF corrected, p < 0.01), followed by post hoc two-sample t-tests 
(Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.05). We then investigated the relationship between 
the mean imaging metrics and cognitive abilities.
RESULTS: There are no significant differences in gender, age, or education among 
the four groups. The interaction effect on brain activity was located in the 
inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Post hoc analysis showed that APOE ε2/ε3 MCI had 
an increased IPL fALFF than APOE ε3/ε3 MCI. Regarding the APOE ε2 allele 
effects, we found that ε2 carriers had a decreased fALFF in the transverse 
temporal gyrus than non-carriers. Also, FDG-PET results showed a lower SUVR of 
the frontal lobe in APOE ε2 carriers than non-carriers. Furthermore, fALFF of 
IPL was correlated with the visuospatial function (r = -0.16, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: APOE ε2 carriers might have a better brain reservation when coping 
with AD-related pathologies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. 
By the time an individual has been diagnosed with AD, it may be too late for 
potential disease modifying therapy to strongly influence outcome. Therefore, it 
is critical to develop better diagnostic tools that can recognize AD at early 
symptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic stages. Mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), introduced to describe a prodromal stage of AD, is presently classified 
into early and late stages (E-MCI, L-MCI) based on severity. Using a graph-based 
semi-supervised learning (SSL) method to integrate multimodal brain imaging data 
and select valid imaging-based predictors for optimizing prediction accuracy, we 
developed a model to differentiate E-MCI from healthy controls (HC) for early 
detection of AD. Multimodal brain imaging scans (MRI and PET) of 174 E-MCI and 
98 HC participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
cohort were used in this analysis. Mean targeted region-of-interest (ROI) values 
extracted from structural MRI (voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer V5) 
and PET (FDG and Florbetapir) scans were used as features. Our results show that 
the graph-based SSL classifiers outperformed support vector machines for this 
task and the best performance was obtained with 66.8% cross-validated AUC (area 
under the ROC curve) when FDG and FreeSurfer datasets were integrated. Valid 
imaging-based phenotypes selected from our approach included ROI values 
extracted from temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala. Employing a graph-based 
SSL approach with multimodal brain imaging data appears to have substantial 
potential for detecting E-MCI for early detection of prodromal AD warranting 
further investigation.

Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies report 
characteristic patterns of cerebral hypometabolism in probable Alzheimer's 
disease (pAD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This study aims to 
characterize the consistency of regional hypometabolism in pAD and aMCI patients 
enrolled in the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) using statistical parametric 
mapping (SPM) and bootstrap resampling, and to compare bootstrap-based 
reliability index to the commonly used type-I error approach with or without 
correction for multiple comparisons. Batched SPM5 was run for each of 1000 
bootstrap iterations to compare FDG-PET images from 74 pAD and 142 aMCI 
patients, respectively, to 82 normal controls. Maps of the hypometabolic voxels 
detected for at least a specific percentage of times over the 1000 runs were 
examined and compared to an overlap of the hypometabolic maps obtained from 3 
randomly partitioned independent sub-datasets. The results from the bootstrap 
derived reliability of regional hypometabolism in the overall data set were 
similar to that observed in each of the three non-overlapping sub-sets using 
family-wise error. Strong but non-linear association was found between the 
bootstrap-based reliability index and the type-I error. For threshold p=0.0005, 
pAD was associated with extensive hypometabolic voxels in the posterior 
cingulate/precuneus and parietotemporal regions with reliability between 90% and 
100%. Bootstrap analysis provides an alternative to the parametric family-wise 
error approach used to examine consistency of hypometabolic brain voxels in pAD 
and aMCI patients. These results provide a foundation for the use of bootstrap 
analysis characterize statistical ROIs or search regions in both cross-sectional 
and longitudinal FDG-PET studies. This approach offers promise in the early 
detection and tracking of AD, the evaluation of AD-modifying treatments, and 
other biologically or clinical important measurements using brain images and 
voxel-based data analysis techniques.

: An improved computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is proposed for the early 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the fusion of anatomical 
(magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and functional (8F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)) multimodal images, and which helps to 
address the strong ambiguity or the uncertainty produced in brain images. The 
merit of this fusion is that it provides anatomical information for the accurate 
detection of pathological areas characterized in functional imaging by 
physiological abnormalities. First, quantification of brain tissue volumes is 
proposed based on a fusion scheme in three successive steps: modeling, fusion 
and decision. (1) Modeling which consists of three sub-steps: the initialization 
of the centroids of the tissue clusters by applying the Bias corrected Fuzzy 
C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Then, the optimization of the initial 
partition is performed by running genetic algorithms. Finally, the creation of 
white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue maps by 
applying the Possibilistic FCM clustering algorithm. (2) Fusion using a 
possibilistic operator to merge the maps of the MRI and PET images highlighting 
redundancies and managing ambiguities. (3) Decision offering more representative 
anatomo-functional fusion images. Second, a support vector data description 
(SVDD) classifier is used that must reliably distinguish AD from normal aging 
and automatically detects outliers. The "divide and conquer" strategy is then 
used, which speeds up the SVDD process and reduces the load and cost of the 
calculating. The robustness of the tissue quantification process is proven 
against noise (20% level), partial volume effects and when inhomogeneities of 
spatial intensity are high. Thus, the superiority of the SVDD classifier over 
competing conventional systems is also demonstrated with the adoption of the 
10-fold cross-validation approach for synthetic datasets (Alzheimer disease 
neuroimaging (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)) and real 
images. The percentage of classification in terms of accuracy (%), sensitivity 
(%), specificity (%) and area under ROC curve was 93.65%, 90.08%, 92.75% and 
0.973; 91.46%, 92%, 91.78% and 0.967; 85.09%, 86.41%, 84.92% and 0.946 in the 
case of the ADNI, OASIS and real images respectively.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that 
accounts for 60-70% of cases of dementia in the elderly. An early diagnosis of 
AD is usually hampered for many reasons including the variable clinical and 
pathological features exhibited among affected individuals. This paper presents 
a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system with the primary goal of improving the 
accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of diagnosis. In this system, PiB-PET 
scans, which were obtained from the ADNI database, underwent five essential 
stages. First, the scans were standardized and de-noised. Second, an Automated 
Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas was utilized to partition the brain into 116 
regions or labels that served for local (region-based) diagnosis. Third, 
scale-invariant Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) was used, per brain label, to detect 
the discriminant features. Fourth, the regions' features were analyzed using a 
general linear model in the form of a two-sample t-test. Fifth, the support 
vector machines (SVM) and their probabilistic variant (pSVM) were constructed to 
provide local, followed by global diagnosis. The system was evaluated on scans 
of normal control (NC) vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (19 NC and 65 MCI 
scans). The proposed system showed superior accuracy, specificity, and 
sensitivity as compared to other related work.

Neuroimaging genetics has attracted growing attention and interest, which is 
thought to be a powerful strategy to examine the influence of genetic variants 
(i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) on structures or functions of 
human brain. In recent studies, univariate or multivariate regression analysis 
methods are typically used to capture the effective associations between genetic 
variants and quantitative traits (QTs) such as brain imaging phenotypes. The 
identified imaging QTs, although associated with certain genetic markers, may 
not be all disease specific. A useful, but underexplored, scenario could be to 
discover only those QTs associated with both genetic markers and disease status 
for revealing the chain from genotype to phenotype to symptom. In addition, 
multimodal brain imaging phenotypes are extracted from different perspectives 
and imaging markers consistently showing up in multimodalities may provide more 
insights for mechanistic understanding of diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)). In this work, we propose a general framework to exploit multi-modal brain 
imaging phenotypes as intermediate traits that bridge genetic risk factors and 
multi-class disease status. We applied our proposed method to explore the 
relation between the well-known AD risk SNP APOE rs429358 and three baseline 
brain imaging modalities (i.e., structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and F-18 florbetapir 
PET scans amyloid imaging (AV45)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed 
method not only helps improve the performances of imaging genetic associations, 
but also discovers robust and consistent regions of interests (ROIs) across 
multi-modalities to guide the disease-induced interpretation.

Incomplete data present serious problems when integrating largescale brain 
imaging data sets from different imaging modalities. In the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), for example, over half of the subjects lack 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements; an independent half of the subjects do 
not have fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans; many 
lack proteomics measurements. Traditionally, subjects with missing measures are 
discarded, resulting in a severe loss of available information. We address this 
problem by proposing two novel learning methods where all the samples (with at 
least one available data source) can be used. In the first method, we divide our 
samples according to the availability of data sources, and we learn shared sets 
of features with state-of-the-art sparse learning methods. Our second method 
learns a base classifier for each data source independently, based on which we 
represent each source using a single column of prediction scores; we then 
estimate the missing prediction scores, which, combined with the existing 
prediction scores, are used to build a multi-source fusion model. To illustrate 
the proposed approaches, we classify patients from the ADNI study into groups 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal 
controls, based on the multi-modality data. At baseline, ADNI's 780 participants 
(172 AD, 397 MCI, 211 Normal), have at least one of four data types: magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET, CSF and proteomics. These data are used to 
test our algorithms. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed methods 
yield stable and promising results.

Analysis of incomplete data is a big challenge when integrating large-scale 
brain imaging datasets from different imaging modalities. In the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), for example, over half of the subjects 
lack cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements; an independent half of the subjects 
do not have fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans; 
many lack proteomics measurements. Traditionally, subjects with missing measures 
are discarded, resulting in a severe loss of available information. In this 
paper, we address this problem by proposing an incomplete Multi-Source Feature 
(iMSF) learning method where all the samples (with at least one available data 
source) can be used. To illustrate the proposed approach, we classify patients 
from the ADNI study into groups with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and normal controls, based on the multi-modality data. At 
baseline, ADNI's 780 participants (172AD, 397 MCI, 211 NC), have at least one of 
four data types: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET, CSF and proteomics. 
These data are used to test our algorithm. Depending on the problem being 
solved, we divide our samples according to the availability of data sources, and 
we learn shared sets of features with state-of-the-art sparse learning methods. 
To build a practical and robust system, we construct a classifier ensemble by 
combining our method with four other methods for missing value estimation. 
Comprehensive experiments with various parameters show that our proposed iMSF 
method and the ensemble model yield stable and promising results.

PURPOSE: To assess the extent to which multiple Alzheimer disease (AD) 
biomarkers improve the ability to predict future decline in subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with predictions based on clinical 
parameters alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All protocols were approved by the institutional review 
board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 
The study was HIPAA compliant. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and fluorine 18 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) studies for 97 
subjects with MCI were used. MR imaging-derived gray matter probability maps and 
FDG PET images were analyzed by using independent component analysis, an 
unbiased data-driven method to extract independent sources of information from 
whole-brain data. The loading parameters for all MR imaging and FDG components, 
along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, were entered into logistic 
regression models (dependent variable: conversion to AD within 4 years). Eight 
models were considered, including all combinations of MR imaging, PET, and CSF 
markers with the covariates (age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score).
RESULTS: Combining MR imaging, FDG PET, and CSF data with routine clinical tests 
significantly increased the accuracy of predicting conversion to AD compared 
with clinical testing alone. The misclassification rate decreased from 41.3% to 
28.4% (P < .00001). FDG PET contributed more information to routine tests (P < 
.00001) than CSF (P = .32) or MR imaging (P = .08).
CONCLUSION: Imaging and CSF biomarkers can improve prediction of conversion from 
MCI to AD compared with baseline clinical testing. FDG PET appears to add the 
greatest prognostic information.

One hundred years has passed since the appearance of the first article on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), by Alois Alzheimer. AD is the most common form of 
dementia, accounting for over 50% of all dementia and affecting more than 26 
million people worldwide. Since the 1980s, the pace of research into the nature 
of AD has greatly accelerated, and investigators currently believe that it will 
become possible to treat or prevent AD, which is a major socioeconomic concern 
in all developed countries of the world. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a 
relatively recent term used to describe people who have some memory problems, 
but do not actually have dementia. In recent years, some drug treatments that 
can improve the symptoms of AD have become available. Other treatments that may 
slow down the progression of AD in the brain are also being developed. It is 
important that people with AD be identified as early as possible, so that they 
can benefit from these treatments in the future. Identifying people with MCI is 
one way to try to achieve this. In Japan, the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) was launched in 2008. It follows the protocols 
established by US-ADNI, and aims to conduct a longitudinal workup of 
standardized neuroimaging, biomarker, and clinico-psychological surveys. The 
Japanese research protocol was designed to maximize compatibility with that of 
US-ADNI, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis for the 
evaluation of brain atrophy, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PIB-PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, and APOE 
genotyping, as well as a set of clinical and psychometric tests that were 
prepared so as to achieve the greatest compatibility possible with those used in 
US-ADNI. J-ADNI has recruited approximately 357 participants (142 with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment, some 134 elders without impairment, and 72 persons 
with mild Alzheimer's disease) as of April 15, 2010. Worldwide ADNI activities 
will allow the establishment of rigorous quantitative descriptions of the 
natural course of AD in its very early stages. In addition, this project will 
aid in the clarification and differentiation of MCI and AD. The major goal of 
this research is the establishment of surrogate markers for AD based on MRI, 
PET, and CSF data. This data, as well as the methodologies and infrastructure 
used, will facilitate clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for AD 
using surrogate biomarkers, enabling the application of effective therapies with 
AD/MCI patients, and eventually the prevention of AD. In this symposium, I will 
speak about MCI and early-stage AD, with a particular focus on the latest 
clinical neuroimaging data from J-ADNI.

Amyloid imaging with [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) provides in vivo data on 
plaque deposition in those with, or at risk for, Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
performed a gene-based association analysis of 15 quality-controlled 
amyloid-pathway associated candidate genes in 103 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative participants. The mean normalized PiB uptake value 
across four brain regions known to have amyloid deposition in AD was used as a 
quantitative phenotype. The minor allele of an intronic SNP within DHCR24 was 
identified and associated with a lower average PiB uptake. Further investigation 
at whole-brain voxel-wise level indicated that non-carriers of the minor allele 
had higher PiB uptake in frontal regions compared to carriers. DHCR24 has been 
previously shown to confer resistance against beta-amyloid and oxidative 
stress-induced apoptosis, thus our findings support a neuroprotective role. 
Pathway-based genetic analysis of targeted molecular imaging phenotypes appears 
promising to help elucidate disease pathophysiology and identify potential 
therapeutic targets.

Clinical trials of disease modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might benefit from enrichment with 
true AD cases. Four hundred five MCI patients (143 converters and 262 
nonconverters to AD within 2 years) of the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) were used. Markers for enrichment were hippocampal atrophy on 
magnetic resonance (MRI), temporoparietal hypometabolism on FDG PET, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, and phospho-tau), and 
cortical amyloid deposition (11C-PIB positron emission tomography (PET)). Two 
separate enrichment strategies were tested to A) maximize the proportion of MCI 
converters screened in, and B) minimize the proportion of MCI converters 
screened out. Based on strategy A, when compared with no enrichment and ADAS-Cog 
as an outcome measure (sample size of 834), enrichment with 18F-FDG PET and 
hippocampal volume lowered samples size to 260 and 277 cases per arm, but at the 
cost of screening out 1,597 and 434 cases per arm. When compared with no 
enrichment and clinical dementia rating (CDR-SOB) as an outcome measure (sample 
size of 674), enrichment with hippocampal volume and Abeta42 lowered sample 
sizes to 191 and 291 cases per arm, with 639 and 157 screened out cases. 
Strategy B reduced the number of screened out cases (740 for [11C]-PIB PET, 101 
hippocampal volume, 82 ADAS-COG and 330 for [18F]-FDG PET) but at the expense of 
decreased power and a relative increase size (740 for [11C]-PIB PET, 676 for 
hippocampal volume, 744 for ADAS-Cog, and 517 for [18F]-FDG PET). Enrichment 
comes at the price of an often relevant proportion of screened out cases, and in 
clinical trial settings, the balance between enrichment of screened in and loss 
of screened out patients should be critically discussed.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal 
multisite observational study of healthy elders, mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
(18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), urine serum, 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as well as clinical/psychometric 
assessments are acquired at multiple time points. All data will be cross-linked 
and made available to the general scientific community. The purpose of this 
report is to describe the MRI methods employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core 
established specifications that guided protocol development. A major effort was 
devoted to evaluating 3D T(1)-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. 
Several options for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer 
platforms and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol 
selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization prepared 
rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B(1)-calibration scans when applicable; and 
an axial proton density-T(2) dual contrast (i.e., echo) fast spin echo/turbo 
spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection. ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize 
scientific utility while minimizing the burden placed on participants. The 
approach taken in ADNI to standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI 
protocol, postacquisition corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all 
scanners could be used as a model for other multisite trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Using 
discrete disease status as the phenotype and computing statistics at the single 
marker level may not be able to address the underlying biological interactions 
that contribute to disease mechanism and may contribute to the issue of "missing 
heritability." We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a 
genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) of an amyloid imaging phenotype, using the 
data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We investigated the 
genetic main effects and interaction effects on cingulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) load 
in an effort to better understand the genetic etiology of Aβ deposition that is 
a widely studied AD biomarker. PLINK was used in the single marker GWAS, and 
INTERSNP was used to perform the two-marker GWIS, focusing only on SNPs with p ≤ 
0.01 for the GWAS analysis. Age, sex, and diagnosis were used as covariates in 
both analyses. Corrected p values using the Bonferroni method were reported. The 
GWAS analysis revealed significant hits within or proximal to APOE, APOC1, and 
TOMM40 genes, which were previously implicated in AD. The GWIS analysis yielded 
8 novel SNP-SNP interaction findings that warrant replication and further 
investigation.

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is known to have a complex, oligogenic 
etiology, with considerable genetic heterogeneity. We investigated the influence 
of genetic interactions between genes in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathway on 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition as measured by PiB or AV-45 ligand positron 
emission tomography (PET) to aid in understanding LOAD's genetic etiology. 
Subsets of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts were 
used for discovery and for two independent validation analyses. A significant 
interaction between RYR3 and CACNA1C was confirmed in all three of the 
independent ADNI datasets. Both genes encode calcium channels expressed in the 
brain. The results shown here support previous animal studies implicating 
interactions between these calcium channels in amyloidogenesis and suggest that 
the pathological cascade of this disease may be modified by interactions in the 
amyloid-calcium axis. Future work focusing on the mechanisms of such 
relationships may inform targets for clinical intervention.

PURPOSE: To describe results of the Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration (ATN) 
research framework classification in the Argentine-Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (arg-ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 12 dementia 
of Alzheimer's type (DAT), and 14 normal controls were studied following the 
ADNI2 protocol. Patients were categorized according to presence or absence of 
the biomarkers for amyloid beta (Aβ; A: amyloid positron emission tomography 
[PET] scan or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Aβ42), tau (T: CSF phosphorylated-tau), 
and neurodegeneration (N: CSF total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET scan, or 
structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan).
RESULTS: A+T+N+ biomarker profile was identified at baseline in 91% of mild 
dementia patients, 20% of early MCI patients, 46% of late MCI patients, and 14% 
of control subjects. Suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP, A-T-N+) was found 
in 8% of mild dementia, 20% of early MCI, 15% of late MCI, and 7% of control 
subjects. Conversion rates to dementia after 5-year follow-up were 85% in A+T+N+ 
MCI patients and 50% in A-T-N+ patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We present initial 5-year follow-up results of a regional ADNI 
based on AD biomarkers and the ATN classification.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in elderly 
people. Its development has been shown to be closely related to changes in the 
brain connectivity network and in the brain activation patterns along with 
structural changes caused by the neurodegenerative process. Methods to infer 
dependence between brain regions are usually derived from the analysis of 
covariance between activation levels in the different areas. However, these 
covariance-based methods are not able to estimate conditional independence 
between variables to factor out the influence of other regions. Conversely, 
models based on the inverse covariance, or precision matrix, such as Sparse 
Gaussian Graphical Models allow revealing conditional independence between 
regions by estimating the covariance between two variables given the rest as 
constant. This paper uses Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE) methods to 
learn undirected graphs in order to derive functional and structural 
connectivity patterns from Fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Position Emission 
Tomography (PET) data and segmented Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), drawn from 
the ADNI database, for Control, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment Subjects), and AD 
subjects. Sparse computation fits perfectly here as brain regions usually only 
interact with a few other areas. The models clearly show different metabolic 
covariation patters between subject groups, revealing the loss of strong 
connections in AD and MCI subjects when compared to Controls. Similarly, the 
variance between GM (Gray Matter) densities of different regions reveals 
different structural covariation patterns between the different groups. Thus, 
the different connectivity patterns for controls and AD are used in this paper 
to select regions of interest in PET and GM images with discriminative power for 
early AD diagnosis. Finally, functional an structural models are combined to 
leverage the classification accuracy. The results obtained in this work show the 
usefulness of the Sparse Gaussian Graphical models to reveal functional and 
structural connectivity patterns. This information provided by the sparse 
inverse covariance matrices is not only used in an exploratory way but we also 
propose a method to use it in a discriminative way. Regression coefficients are 
used to compute reconstruction errors for the different classes that are then 
introduced in a SVM for classification. Classification experiments performed 
using 68 Controls, 70 AD, and 111 MCI images and assessed by cross-validation 
show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with the glucose analog 
F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is widely used in the diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Guidelines recommend voxel-based statistical testing 
to support visual evaluation of the PET images. However, the performance of 
voxel-based testing strongly depends on each single preprocessing step involved.
OBJECTIVE: To optimize the processing pipeline of voxel-based testing for the 
prognosis of dementia in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The study included 108 ADNI MCI subjects grouped as 'stable MCI' 
(n = 77) or 'MCI-to-AD converter' according to their diagnostic trajectory over 
3 years. Thirty-two ADNI normals served as controls. Voxel-based testing was 
performed with the statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8) starting with 
default settings. The following modifications were added step-by-step: (i) 
motion correction, (ii) custom-made FDG template, (iii) different reference 
regions for intensity scaling, and (iv) smoothing was varied between 8 and 
18 mm. The t-sum score for hypometabolism within a predefined AD mask was 
compared between the different settings using receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analysis with respect to differentiation between 'stable MCI' and 
'MCI-to-AD converter'. The area (AUC) under the ROC curve was used as 
performance measure.
RESULTS: The default setting provided an AUC of 0.728. The modifications of the 
processing pipeline improved the AUC up to 0.832 (p = 0.046). Improvement of the 
AUC was confirmed in an independent validation sample of 241 ADNI MCI subjects 
(p = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: The prognostic value of voxel-based single subject analysis of brain 
FDG PET in MCI subjects can be improved considerably by optimizing the 
processing pipeline.

In mostly small single-center studies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated 
with characteristic and progressive reductions in fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (PET) measurements of the regional cerebral metabolic rate 
for glucose (CMRgl). The AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is acquiring FDG PET, 
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, and other biomarker measurements in a 
large longitudinal multi-center study of initially mildly affected probable AD 
(pAD) patients, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, who are at 
increased AD risk, and cognitively normal controls (NC), and we are responsible 
for analyzing the PET images using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Here we 
compare baseline CMRgl measurements from 74 pAD patients and 142 aMCI patients 
to those from 82 NC, we correlate CMRgl with categorical and continuous measures 
of clinical disease severity, and we compare apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4 
carriers to non-carriers in each of these subject groups. In comparison with NC, 
the pAD and aMCI groups each had significantly lower CMRgl bilaterally in 
posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietotemporal and frontal cortex. Similar 
reductions were observed when categories of disease severity or lower 
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were correlated with lower CMRgl. However, 
when analyses were restricted to the pAD patients, lower MMSE scores were 
significantly correlated with lower left frontal and temporal CMRgl. These 
findings from a large, multi-site study support previous single-site findings, 
supports the characteristic pattern of baseline CMRgl reductions in AD and aMCI 
patients, as well as preferential anterior CMRgl reductions after the onset of 
AD dementia.

With 90% of neuroscience clinical trials failing to see efficacy, there is a 
clear need for the development of disease biomarkers that can improve the 
ability to predict human Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial outcomes from animal 
studies. Several lines of evidence, including genetic susceptibility and disease 
studies, suggest the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) as a potential biomarker with congruency between humans and animal 
models. For example, early in AD, patients present with decreased glucose 
metabolism in the entorhinal cortex and several regions of the brain associated 
with disease pathology and cognitive decline. While several of the commonly used 
AD mouse models fail to show all the hallmarks of the disease or the limbic to 
cortical trajectory, there has not been a systematic evaluation of 
imaging-derived biomarkers across animal models of AD, contrary to what has been 
achieved in recent years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) (Miller, 2009). If animal AD models were found to mimic endpoints that 
correlate with the disease onset, progression, and relapse, then the 
identification of such markers in animal models could afford the field a 
translational tool to help bridge the preclinical-clinical gap. Using a 
combination of FDG-PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we 
examined the Tg2576 mouse for global and regional measures of brain glucose 
metabolism at 7 and 19 months of age. In experiment 1 we observed that at 
younger ages, when some plaque burden and cognitive deficits have been reported, 
Tg2576 mice showed hypermetabolism as assessed with FDG-PET. This 
hypermetabolism decreased with age to levels similar to wild type (WT) 
counterparts such that the 19-month-old transgenic (Tg) mice did not differ from 
age matched WTs. In experiment 2, using cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI, we 
demonstrated that the hypermetabolism observed in Tg mice at 7 months could not 
be explained by changes in hemodynamic parameters as no differences were 
observed when compared with WTs. Taken together, these data identify brain 
hypermetabolism in Tg2576 mice which cannot be accounted for by changes in 
vascular compliance. Instead, the hypermetabolism may reflect a neuronal 
compensatory mechanism. Our data are discussed in the context of disease 
biomarker identification and target validation, suggesting little or no utility 
for translational based studies using Tg2576 mice.

BACKGROUND: The prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression from its 
early stages is a research priority. In this context, the use of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) in AD has experienced a notable surge in recent years. 
However, existing investigations predominantly concentrate on distinguishing 
clinical phenotypes through cross-sectional approaches. This study aims to 
investigate the potential of modeling additional dimensions of the disease, such 
as variations in brain metabolism assessed via [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET), and utilize this information to identify patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to dementia (pMCI).
METHODS: We analyzed data from 1,617 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had undergone at least one FDG-PET scan. We 
identified the brain regions with the most significant hypometabolism in AD and 
used Deep Learning (DL) models to predict future changes in brain metabolism. 
The best-performing model was then adapted under a multi-task learning framework 
to identify pMCI individuals. Finally, this model underwent further analysis 
using eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques.
RESULTS: Our results confirm a strong association between hypometabolism, 
disease progression, and cognitive decline. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
integrating data on changes in brain metabolism during training enhanced the 
models' ability to detect pMCI individuals (sensitivity=88.4%, 
specificity=86.9%). Lastly, the application of XAI techniques enabled us to 
delve into the brain regions with the most significant impact on model 
predictions, highlighting the importance of the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, 
and some subcortical structures.
CONCLUSION: This study introduces a novel dimension to predictive modeling in 
AD, emphasizing the importance of projecting variations in brain metabolism 
under a multi-task learning paradigm.

Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stage 
(i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI), is very important for possible delay and 
early treatment of the disease. Recently, multi-modality methods have been used 
for fusing information from multiple different and complementary imaging and 
non-imaging modalities. Although there are a number of existing multi-modality 
methods, few of them have addressed the problem of joint identification of 
disease-related brain regions from multi-modality data for classification. In 
this paper, we proposed a manifold regularized multi-task learning framework to 
jointly select features from multi-modality data. Specifically, we formulate the 
multi-modality classification as a multi-task learning framework, where each 
task focuses on the classification based on each modality. In order to capture 
the intrinsic relatedness among multiple tasks (i.e., modalities), we adopted a 
group sparsity regularizer, which ensures only a small number of features to be 
selected jointly. In addition, we introduced a new manifold based Laplacian 
regularization term to preserve the geometric distribution of original data from 
each task, which can lead to the selection of more discriminative features. 
Furthermore, we extend our method to the semi-supervised setting, which is very 
important since the acquisition of a large set of labeled data (i.e., diagnosis 
of disease) is usually expensive and time-consuming, while the collection of 
unlabeled data is relatively much easier. To validate our method, we have 
performed extensive evaluations on the baseline Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data of 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our experimental 
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

INTRODUCTION: We developed machine learning (ML) designed to analyze structural 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and trained it on the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. In this study, we verified its 
utility in the Japanese population.
METHODS: A total of 535 participants were enrolled from the Japanese ADNI 
database, including 148 AD, 152 normal, and 235 mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Probability of AD was expressed as AD likelihood scores (ADLS).
RESULTS: The accuracy of AD diagnosis was 88.0% to 91.2%. The accuracy of 
predicting the disease progression in non-dementia participants over a 3-year 
observation was 76.0% to 79.3%. More than 90% of the participants with low ADLS 
did not progress to AD within 3 years. In the amyloid positron emission 
tomography (PET)-positive MCI, the hazard ratio of progression was 2.39 with low 
ADLS, and 5.77 with high ADLS. When high ADLS was defined as N+ and Pittsburgh 
compound B (PiB) PET positivity was defined as A+, the time to disease 
progression for 50% of MCI participants was 23.7 months in A+N+, whereas it was 
52.3 months in A+N-.
CONCLUSION: These results support the feasibility of our ML for the diagnosis of 
AD and prediction of the disease progression.

OBJECTIVE: The pattern expression score (PES), i.e., the degree to which a 
pathology-related pattern is present, is frequently used in FDG-brain-PET 
analysis and has been shown to be a powerful predictor of conversion to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Since, inevitably, 
the PES is affected by non-pathological variability, our aim was to improve 
classification with the simple, yet novel approach to identify patterns of 
non-pathological variance in a separate control sample using principal component 
analysis and removing them from patient data (controls-based denoising, CODE) 
before calculating the PES.
METHODS: Multi-center FDG-PET from 220 MCI patients (64 non-converter, follow-up 
≥ 4 years; 156 AD converter, time-to-conversion ≤ 4 years) were obtained from 
the ADNI database. Patterns of non-pathological variance were determined from 
262 healthy controls. An AD pattern was calculated from AD patients and 
controls. We predicted AD conversion based on PES only and on PES combined with 
neuropsychological features and ApoE4 genotype. We compared classification 
performance achieved with and without CODE and with a standard machine learning 
approach (support vector machine).
RESULTS: Our model predicts that CODE improves the signal-to-noise ratio of 
AD-PES by a factor of 1.5. PES-based prediction of AD conversion improved from 
AUC 0.80 to 0.88 (p= 0.001, DeLong's method), sensitivity 69 to 83%, specificity 
81% to 88% and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.45 to 0.66. Best 
classification (0.93 AUC) was obtained when combining the denoised PES with 
clinical features.
CONCLUSIONS: CODE, applied in its basic form, significantly improved prediction 
of conversion based on PES. The achieved classification performance was higher 
than with a standard machine learning algorithm, which was trained on patients, 
explainable by the fact that CODE used additional information (large sample of 
healthy controls). We conclude that the proposed, novel method is a powerful 
tool for improving medical image analysis that offers a wide spectrum of 
biomedical applications, even beyond image analysis.

INTRODUCTION: In Alzheimer's disease, asymptomatic patients may have amyloid 
deposition, but predicting their progression rate remains a substantial 
challenge with implications for clinical trial enrollment. Here, we demonstrate 
an artificial intelligence approach to use baseline clinical information and 
images to predict changes in quantitative biomarkers of brain pathology on 
future images.
METHODS: Patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
who underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with the amyloid radiotracer 
18F-AV45 (florbetapir) were included. We identified important baseline PET image 
features using a deep convolutional neural network based on ResNet. These were 
combined with eight clinical, demographic, and genetic markers using a 
gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to predict future quantitative 
standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), an established biomarker of brain 
amyloid deposition. We used this model to better identify individuals with the 
highest positive change in amyloid deposition on future images and compared this 
to typical inclusion criteria for clinical trials. We also compared the model's 
performance to other methods such as multivariate linear regression and GBDT 
without imaging features.
FINDINGS: Using 2577 PET scans from 1224 unique individuals, we showed that the 
GBDT with deep image features was significantly more accurate than the other 
approaches, reaching a root mean squared error of 0.0339 ± 0.0027 for future 
SUVR prediction. Using this approach, we could identify individuals with the 
highest 10% SUVR accumulation at rates 2- to 4-fold higher than by random pick 
or existing inclusion criteria.
DISCUSSION: Predicting quantitative biomarkers on future images using machine 
learning methods consisting of deep image features combined with clinical data 
may allow better targeting of treatments or enrollment in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to represent a 
transitional stage between ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD). To aim at 
identifying neuroimaging measures associated with cognitive changes in healthy 
elderly and MCI patients, longitudinal multicentre studies are ongoing in 
several countries. The patient profiles of each study are based on unique 
inclusion criteria.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to clarify differences in baseline 
profiles of MCI patients between Studies on Diagnosis of Early Alzheimer's 
Disease-Japan (SEAD-J) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
and to examine the association between baseline profiles and risk of early 
conversion to AD.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: SEAD-J recruited 114 patients from nine facilities in 
Japan. A total of 200 patients in ADNI with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) were enrolled from the USA.
METHODS: Baseline profiles were statistically analysed. For FDG-PET at a time of 
inclusion, associations between each profile and cerebral metabolic rate for 
glucose (CMRgl) were examined using SPM5 software. In each study, the ratio of 
conversion to AD within the 1-year and 2-year period after inclusion was 
investigated and differences in baseline profiles between AD converters and 
non-converters were analysed.
RESULTS: SEAD-J included MCI patients with more severe verbal memory deficits 
and extracted patients with higher depressive tendencies. These differences were 
likely to be associated with criteria. SEAD-J exhibited a higher rate of 
conversion within 1 year compared with ADNI (24.5% vs 13.5%). In FDG-PET 
analyses of SEAD-J, AD converters within 1 year showed more severe decrease of 
FDG uptake in bilateral inferior parietal regions compared with non-converters.
CONCLUSIONS: Different inclusion criteria provided differences in baseline 
profiles. The severity of memory deficit might cause increase of the AD 
conversion within 1 year. Clinical outcomes of multicentre studies for early 
diagnosis of AD should be interpreted carefully considering profiles of 
patients.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish radiomics models based on positron 
emission tomography (PET) images to longitudinally predict transition from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: In our study, 278 MCI patients from the ADNI database were analyzed, 
where 60 transitioned to AD (pMCI) and 218 remained stable (sMCI) over 
48 months. Patients were divided into a training set (n = 222) and a validation 
set (n = 56). We first employed voxel-based analysis of 18F-FDG PET images to 
identify brain regions that present significant SUV difference between pMCI and 
sMCI groups. Radiomic features were extracted from these regions, key features 
were selected, and predictive models were developed for individual and combined 
brain regions. The models' effectiveness was evaluated using metrics like AUC to 
determine the most accurate predictive model for MCI progression.
RESULTS: Voxel-based analysis revealed four brain regions implicated in the 
progression from MCI to AD. These include ROI1 within the Temporal lobe, ROI2 
and ROI3 in the Thalamus, and ROI4 in the Limbic system. Among the predictive 
models developed for these individual regions, the model utilizing ROI4 
demonstrated superior predictive accuracy. In the training set, the AUC for the 
ROI4 model was 0.803 (95% CI 0.736, 0.865), and in the validation set, it 
achieved an AUC of 0.733 (95% CI 0.559, 0.893). Conversely, the model based on 
ROI3 showed the lowest performance, with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.685, 0.809). 
Notably, the comprehensive model encompassing all identified regions (ROI total) 
outperformed the single-region models, achieving an AUC of 0.884 (95% CI 0.845, 
0.921) in the training set and 0.816 (95% CI 0.705, 0.909) in the validation 
set, indicating significantly enhanced predictive capability for MCI progression 
to AD.
CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the Limbic system as the brain region most 
closely associated with the progression from MCI to AD. Importantly, our study 
demonstrates that a PET brain radiomics model encompassing multiple brain 
regions (ROI total) significantly outperforms models based on single brain 
regions. This comprehensive approach more accurately identifies MCI patients at 
high risk of progressing to AD, offering valuable insights for non-invasive 
diagnostics and facilitating early and timely interventions in clinical 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in brain of patients with suspected 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) 
in vivo. While visual classification prevails in the clinical routine, 
semiquantitative PET analyses may enable more reliable evaluation of cases with 
a visually uncertain, borderline Aβ accumulation.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated different analysis approaches (visual/semiquantitative) 
to find the most accurate and sensitive interpretation of Aβ-PET for predicting 
risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.
METHODS: Based on standard uptake value (SUV) ratios of a cortical-composite 
volume of interest of 18F-AV45-PET from MCI subjects (n = 396, ADNI database), 
we compared three different reference region (cerebellar grey matter, CBL; 
brainstem, BST; white matter, WM) normalizations and the visual read by receiver 
operator characteristics for calculating a hazard ratio (HR) for progression to 
Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD).
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up time of 45.6±13.0 months, 28% of the MCI cases 
(110/396) converted to ADD. Among the tested methods, the WM reference showed 
best discriminatory power and progression-risk stratification (HRWM of 4.4 
[2.6-7.6]), but the combined results of the visual and semiquantitative analysis 
with all three reference regions showed an even higher discriminatory power.
CONCLUSION: A multi-analytical composite of visual and semiquantitative 
reference tissue analyses of 18F-AV45-PET gave improved risk stratification for 
progression from MCI to ADD relative to performance of single read-outs. This 
optimized approach is of special interest for prospective treatment trials, 
which demand a high accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: An ascendant body of evidence suggests that Alzheimer disease with 
psychosis (AD+P) is a distinct variant of illness with its own genetic diathesis 
and a unique clinical course. Impaired frontal lobe function has been previously 
implicated in AD+P. The current exploratory study, presented in two parts, 
evaluates both the regional brain metabolic and psychometric correlates of 
psychosis in a longitudinal sample of subjects with AD, made available by the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
METHODS: In Part 1 of the study, 21 ADNI participants with AD who developed 
psychotic symptoms during the study but were not psychotic at baseline were 
matched with 21 participants with AD who never became psychotic during the study 
period, and mean brain [F(18)]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) Cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) by regions of interest 
(ROIs) were compared Additionally, 39 participants with active psychosis at the 
time of image acquisition were matched with 39 participants who were never 
psychotic during the study period, and mean brain FDG-PET CMRgl by sROI were 
compared. In Part 2 of the study, 354 ADNI participants with AD who were 
followed for 24 months with serial psychometric testing were identified, and 
cognitive performance and decline were evaluated for correlation with psychotic 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Part 1: There were no regional brain metabolic differences between 
those with AD destined to become psychotic and those who did not become 
psychotic. There was a significant reduction in mean orbitofrontal brain 
metabolism in those with active psychosis. Part 2: Over the course of study 
follow-up, psychosis was associated with accelerated decline in functional 
performance as measured by the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, the 
Mini-Mental State Examination, and Forward Digit Span.
CONCLUSION: In a sample drawn from the ADNI dataset, our exploratory FDG-PET 
findings and longitudinal cognitive outcomes support the hypofrontality model of 
AD+P. Focal frontal vulnerability may mediate the accelerated decline seen in 
AD+P.

Late-life depression, even when of subsyndromal severity, has shown strong 
associations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Preclinical studies have suggested that serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) can attenuate amyloidogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the 
effect of SSRI medication on amyloidosis and grey matter volume in subsyndromal 
depressed subjects with MCI and AD during an interval of two years. 256 
cognitively affected subjects (225 MCI/ 31 AD) undergoing [18F]-AV45-PET and MRI 
at baseline and 2-year follow-up were selected from the ADNI database. Subjects 
with a positive depression item (DEP(+); n = 73) in the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory Questionnaire were subdivided to those receiving SSRI medication 
(SSRI(+); n = 24) and those without SSRI treatment (SSRI(-); n = 49). 
Longitudinal cognition (Δ-ADAS), amyloid deposition rate (standardized uptake 
value, using white matter as reference region (SUVRWM), and changes in grey 
matter volume were compared using common covariates. Analyses were performed 
separately in all subjects and in the subgroup of amyloid-positive subjects. 
Cognitive performance in DEP(+)/SSRI(+) subjects (Δ-ADAS: -5.0%) showed less 
deterioration with 2-year follow-up when compared to DEP(+)/SSRI(-) subjects 
(Δ-ADAS: +18.6%, p < 0.05), independent of amyloid SUVRWM at baseline. With SSRI 
treatment, the progression of grey matter atrophy was reduced (-0.9% versus 
-2.7%, p < 0.05), notably in fronto-temporal cortex. A slight trend towards 
lower amyloid deposition rate was observed in DEP(+)/SSRI(+) subjects versus 
DEP(+)/SSRI(-). Despite the lack of effect to amyloid PET, SSRI medication 
distinctly rescued the declining cognitive performance in cognitively affected 
patients with depressive symptoms, and likewise attenuated grey matter atrophy.

Accurate classification of either patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD, from 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals is important for clinical diagnosis and 
adequate intervention. The current study focused on distinguishing AD or MCI 
from CU based on the multi-feature kernel supervised within-Class-similar 
discriminative dictionary learning algorithm (MKSCDDL), which we introduced in a 
previous study, demonstrating that MKSCDDL had superior performance in face 
recognition. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and florbetapir-PET data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were all included 
for classification of AD vs. CU, MCI vs. CU, as well as AD vs. MCI (113 AD 
patients, 110 MCI patients, and 117 CU subjects). By adopting MKSCDDL, we 
achieved a classification accuracy of 98.18% for AD vs. CU, 78.50% for MCI vs. 
CU, and 74.47% for AD vs. MCI, which in each instance was superior to results 
obtained using several other state-of-the-art approaches (MKL, JRC, mSRC, and 
mSCDDL). In addition, testing time results outperformed other high quality 
methods. Therefore, the results suggested that the MKSCDDL procedure is a 
promising tool for assisting early diagnosis of diseases using neuroimaging 
data.

The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of four of the most 
validated biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) 
Abeta 1-42, tau, hippocampal volume, and FDG-PET, in patients at different stage 
of AD. Two hundred twenty-nine cognitively healthy subjects, 154 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) patients converted to AD, and 193 (95 early and 98 late) AD 
patients were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. For each biomarker, individual values were Z-transformed and 
plotted against ADAS-cog scores, and sigmoid and linear fits were compared. For 
most biomarkers the sigmoid model fitted data significantly better than the 
linear model. Abeta 1-42 time course followed a steep curve, stabilizing early 
in the disease course. CSF tau and hippocampal volume changed later showing 
similar monotonous trends, reflecting disease progression. Hippocampal loss 
trend was steeper and occurred earlier in time in APOE epsilon4 carriers than in 
non-carriers. FDG-PET started changing early in time and likely followed a 
linear decline. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in favor 
of the dynamic biomarker model which has recently been proposed.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia worldwide as 
a cryptic neurodegenerative disease. The symptoms of AD will last for several 
years, which brings great mental and economic burden to patients and their 
families. Unfortunately, the complete cure of AD still faces great challenges. 
Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose the disease in the early stage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network serves as the 
backbone for feature extraction, which could reduce the time cost of network 
training to a certain extent. In order to better extract image information and 
pay attention to the association information in the images, the group 
convolutional module and the multi-scale RNN-based feature selection module are 
proposed. The dataset employed in the study are drawn from [18F]FDG-PET images 
within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
RESULTS: Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed model 
outperforms several competing approaches in AD-related diagnostic tasks. In 
addition, the model reduces the number of parameters of the model compared to 
the backbone model, from 134.27 M to 17.36 M. Furthermore, the ablation reaserch 
is conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed module.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper introduces a lightweight network architecture for the 
early diagnosis of AD. In contrast to analogous methodologies, the proposed 
method yields acceptable results.

Accurately identifying the patients that have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
who will go on to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) will become essential as new 
treatments will require identification of AD patients at earlier stages in the 
disease process. Most previous work in this area has centred around the same 
automated techniques used to diagnose AD patients from healthy controls, by 
coupling high dimensional brain image data or other relevant biomarker data to 
modern machine learning techniques. Such studies can now distinguish between AD 
patients and controls as accurately as an experienced clinician. Models trained 
on patients with AD and control subjects can also distinguish between MCI 
patients that will convert to AD within a given timeframe (MCI-c) and those that 
remain stable (MCI-s), although differences between these groups are smaller and 
thus, the corresponding accuracy is lower. The most common type of classifier 
used in these studies is the support vector machine, which gives categorical 
class decisions. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian process (GP) 
classification to the problem. This fully Bayesian method produces naturally 
probabilistic predictions, which we show correlate well with the actual chances 
of converting to AD within 3 years in a population of 96 MCI-s and 47 MCI-c 
subjects. Furthermore, we show that GPs can integrate multimodal data (in this 
study volumetric MRI, FDG-PET, cerebrospinal fluid, and APOE genotype with the 
classification process through the use of a mixed kernel). The GP approach aids 
combination of different data sources by learning parameters automatically from 
training data via type-II maximum likelihood, which we compare to a more 
conventional method based on cross validation and an SVM classifier. When the 
resulting probabilities from the GP are dichotomised to produce a binary 
classification, the results for predicting MCI conversion based on the 
combination of all three types of data show a balanced accuracy of 74%. This is 
a substantially higher accuracy than could be obtained using any individual 
modality or using a multikernel SVM, and is competitive with the highest 
accuracy yet achieved for predicting conversion within three years on the widely 
used ADNI dataset.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific and progressive reductions 
in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) measurements of the 
cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl), some of which may precede the onset 
of symptoms. In this report, we describe twelve-month CMRgl declines in 69 
probable AD patients, 154 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 
79 cognitively normal controls (NCs) from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). We introduce the use of an 
empirically pre-defined statistical region-of-interest (sROI) to characterize 
CMRgl declines with optimal power and freedom from multiple comparisons, and we 
estimate the number of patients needed to characterize AD-slowing treatment 
effects in multi-center randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The AD and MCI groups 
each had significant twelve-month CMRgl declines bilaterally in posterior 
cingulate, medial and lateral parietal, medial and lateral temporal, frontal and 
occipital cortex, which were significantly greater than those in the NC group 
and correlated with measures of clinical decline. Using sROIs defined based on 
training sets of baseline and follow-up images to assess CMRgl declines in 
independent test sets from each patient group, we estimate the need for 66 AD 
patients or 217 MCI patients per treatment group to detect a 25% AD-slowing 
treatment effect in a twelve-month, multi-center RCT with 80% power and 
two-tailed alpha=0.05, roughly one-tenth the number of the patients needed to 
study MCI patients using clinical endpoints. Our findings support the use of FDG 
PET, brain-mapping algorithms and empirically pre-defined sROIs in RCTs of 
AD-slowing treatments.

This work is part of the multi-center Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI), a large multi-site study of dementia, including patients 
having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), as 
well as healthy elderly controls. A major portion of ADNI involves the use of 
[(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET). The 
objective of this paper is the reduction of inter-scanner differences in the 
FDG-PET scans obtained from the 50 participating PET centers having fifteen 
different scanner models. In spite of a standardized imaging protocol, 
systematic inter-scanner variability in PET images from various sites is 
observed primarily due to differences in scanner resolution, reconstruction 
techniques, and different implementations of scatter and attenuation 
corrections. Two correction steps were developed by comparison of 3-D Hoffman 
brain phantom scans with the 'gold standard' digital 3-D Hoffman brain phantom: 
i) high frequency correction; where a smoothing kernel for each scanner model 
was estimated to smooth all images to a common resolution and ii) low frequency 
correction; where smooth affine correction factors were obtained to reduce the 
attenuation and scatter correction errors. For the phantom data, the high 
frequency correction reduced the variability by 20%-50% and the low frequency 
correction further reduced the differences by another 20%-25%. Correction 
factors obtained from phantom studies were applied to 95 scans from normal 
control subjects obtained from the participating sites. The high frequency 
correction reduced differences similar to the phantom studies. However, the low 
frequency correction did not further reduce differences; hence further 
refinement of the procedure is necessary.

PURPOSE: This article presents a computer-aided diagnosis technique for 
improving the accuracy of the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two 
hundred and ten 18F-FDG PET images from the ADNI initiative [52 normal controls 
(NC), 114 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 53 AD subjects] are studied.
METHODS: The proposed methodology is based on the selection of voxels of 
interest using the t-test and a posterior reduction of the feature dimension 
using factor analysis. Factor loadings are used as features for three different 
classifiers: Two multivariate Gaussian mixture model, with linear and quadratic 
discriminant function, and a support vector machine with linear kernel.
RESULTS: An accuracy rate up to 95% when NC and AD are considered and an 
accuracy rate up to 88% and 86% for NC-MCI and NC-MCI,AD, respectively, are 
obtained using SVM with linear kernel.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are compared to the voxel-as-features and a PCA- based 
approach and the proposed methodology achieves better classification 
performance.

Careful selection of the reference region for non-quantitative positron emission 
tomography (PET) analyses is critically important for Region of Interest (ROI) 
data analyses. We introduce an empirical method of deriving the most suitable 
reference region for computing neurodegeneration sensitive 
(18)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET ratios based on the dataset collected by the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Candidate reference 
regions are selected based on a heat map of the difference in coefficients of 
variation (COVs) of FDG ratios over time for each of the Automatic Anatomical 
Labeling (AAL) atlas regions normalized by all other AAL regions. Visual 
inspection of the heat map suggests that the portion of the cerebellum and 
vermis superior to the horizontal fissure is the most sensitive reference 
region. Analyses of FDG ratio data show increases in significance on the order 
of ten-fold when using the superior portion of the cerebellum as compared with 
the traditionally used full cerebellum. The approach to reference region 
selection in this paper can be generalized to other radiopharmaceuticals and 
radioligands as well as to other disorders where brain changes over time are 
hypothesized and longitudinal data is available. Based on the empirical evidence 
presented in this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of the COV heat map 
method and conclude that intensity normalization based on the superior portion 
of the cerebellum may be most sensitive to measuring change when performing 
longitudinal analyses of FDG-PET ratios as well as group comparisons in 
Alzheimer's disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging 
Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.

Structural and functional brain images are playing an important role in helping 
us understand the changes associated with neurological disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent efforts have now started investigating their 
utility for diagnosis purposes. This line of research has shown promising 
results where methods from machine learning (such as Support Vector Machines) 
have been used to identify AD-related patterns from images, for use in 
diagnosing new individual subjects. In this paper, we propose a new framework 
for AD classification which makes use of the Linear Program (LP) boosting with 
novel additional regularization based on spatial "smoothness" in 3D image 
coordinate spaces. The algorithm formalizes the expectation that since the 
examples for training the classifier are images, the voxels eventually selected 
for specifying the decision boundary must constitute spatially contiguous 
chunks, i.e., "regions" must be preferred over isolated voxels. This prior 
belief turns out to be useful for significantly reducing the space of possible 
classifiers and leads to substantial benefits in generalization. In our method, 
the requirement of spatial contiguity (of selected discriminating voxels) is 
incorporated within the optimization framework directly. Other methods have made 
use of similar biases as a pre- or post-processing step, however, our model 
incorporates this emphasis on spatial smoothness directly into the learning 
step. We report on extensive evaluations of our algorithm on MR and FDG-PET 
images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and 
discuss the relationship of the classification output with the clinical and 
cognitive biomarker data available within ADNI.

Structural brain network constrained neuroimaging marker identification for 
predicting cognitive functions.

Neuroimaging markers have been widely used to predict the cognitive functions 
relevant to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most previous studies 
identify the imaging markers without considering the brain structural 
correlations between neuroimaging measures. However, many neuroimaging markers 
interrelate and work together to reveal the cognitive functions, such that these 
relevant markers should be selected together as the phenotypic markers. To solve 
this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel network constrained feature 
selection (NCFS) model to identify the neuroimaging markers guided by the 
structural brain network, which is constructed by the sparse representation 
method such that the interrelations between neuroimaging features are encoded 
into probabilities. Our new methods are evaluated by the MRI and AV45-PET data 
from ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). In all 
cognitive function prediction tasks, our new NCFS method outperforms other 
state-of-the-art regression approaches. Meanwhile, we show that the new method 
can select the correlated imaging markers, which are ignored by the competing 
approaches.

Accurate estimation of cognitive scores for patients can help track the progress 
of neurological diseases. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised 
multimodal relevance vector regression (SM-RVR) method for predicting clinical 
scores of neurological diseases from multimodal imaging and biological 
biomarker, to help evaluate pathological stage and predict progression of 
diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Unlike most existing methods, we 
predict clinical scores from multimodal (imaging and biological) biomarkers, 
including MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF. Considering that the clinical scores of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are often less stable compared to those of 
AD and normal control (NC) subjects due to the heterogeneity of MCI, we use only 
the multimodal data of MCI subjects, but no corresponding clinical scores, to 
train a semi-supervised model for enhancing the estimation of clinical scores 
for AD and NC subjects. We also develop a new strategy for selecting the most 
informative MCI subjects. We evaluate the performance of our approach on 202 
subjects with all three modalities of data (MRI, FDG-PET and CSF) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental 
results show that our SM-RVR method achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 
1.91 and a correlation coefficient (CORR) of 0.80 for estimating the MMSE 
scores, and also a RMSE of 4.45 and a CORR of 0.78 for estimating the ADAS-Cog 
scores, demonstrating very promising performances in AD studies.
