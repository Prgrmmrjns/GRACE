BACKGROUND: Hearing impairment was recently identified as the most prominent 
risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the link between 
hearing impairment and dementia are still unclear.
METHODS: We investigated the association of hearing performance with cognitive 
function, brain structure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in 
cross-sectional, longitudinal, mediation and genetic association analyses across 
the UK Biobank (N = 165,550), the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and Lifestyle 
(CABLE, N = 863) study, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI, N = 1770) database.
FINDINGS: Poor hearing performance was associated with worse cognitive function 
in the UK Biobank and in the CABLE study. Hearing impairment was significantly 
related to lower volume of temporal cortex, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobe, 
precuneus, etc., and to lower integrity of white matter (WM) tracts. 
Furthermore, a higher polygenic risk score (PRS) for hearing impairment was 
strongly associated with lower cognitive function, lower volume of gray matter, 
and lower integrity of WM tracts. Moreover, hearing impairment was correlated 
with a high level of CSF tau protein in the CABLE study and in the ADNI 
database. Finally, mediation analyses showed that brain atrophy and tau 
pathology partly mediated the association between hearing impairment and 
cognitive decline.
INTERPRETATION: Hearing impairment is associated with cognitive decline, brain 
atrophy and tau pathology, and hearing impairment may reflect the risk for 
cognitive decline and dementia as it is related to bran atrophy and tau 
accumulation in brain. However, it is necessary to assess the mechanism in 
future animal studies.

Ensemble Vision Transformer for Dementia Diagnosis.

Huang F, Qiu A.

In recent years, deep learning has gained momentum in computer-aided Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) diagnosis. This study introduces a novel approach, Monte Carlo 
Ensemble Vision Transformer (MC-ViT), which develops an ensemble approach with 
Vision transformer (ViT). Instead of using traditional ensemble methods that 
deploy multiple learners, our approach employs a single vision transformer 
learner. By harnessing Monte Carlo sampling, this method produces a broad 
spectrum of classification decisions, enhancing the MC-ViT performance. This 
novel technique adeptly overcomes the limitation of 3D patch convolutional 
neural networks that only characterize partial of the whole brain anatomy, 
paving the way for a neural network adept at discerning 3D inter-feature 
correlations. Evaluations using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset with 7199 scans and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies-3 
(OASIS-3) with 1992 scans showcased its performance. With minimal preprocessing, 
our approach achieved an impressive 90% accuracy in AD classification, 
surpassing both 2D-slice CNNs and 3D CNNs.

In a previous report, we proposed a method for combining multiple markers of 
atrophy caused by Alzheimer's disease into a single atrophy score that is more 
powerful than any one feature. We applied the method to expansion rates of the 
lateral ventricles, achieving the most powerful ventricular atrophy measure to 
date. Here, we expand our method's application to tensor-based morphometry 
measures. We also combine the volumetric tensor-based morphometry measures with 
previously computed ventricular surface measures into a combined atrophy score. 
We show that our atrophy scores are longitudinally unbiased with the intercept 
bias estimated at 2 orders of magnitude below the mean atrophy of control 
subjects at 1 year. Both approaches yield the most powerful biomarker of atrophy 
not only for ventricular measures but also for all published unbiased imaging 
measures to date. A 2-year trial using our measures requires only 31 (22, 43) 
Alzheimer's disease subjects or 56 (44, 64) subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment to detect 25% slowing in atrophy with 80% power and 95% confidence.

BACKGROUND: Glymphatic dysfunction is a crucial pathway for dementia. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies co-existing with cerebral small vessel 
disease (CSVD) is the most common pathogenesis for dementia. We hypothesize that 
AD pathologies and CSVD could be associated with glymphatic dysfunction, 
contributing to cognitive impairment.
METHOD: Participants completed with amyloid PET, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 
and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequences were included from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). White matter 
hyperintensities (WMH), the most common CSVD marker, was evaluated from T2FLAIR 
images and represented the burden of CSVD. Amyloid PET was used to assess Aβ 
aggregation in the brain. We used diffusion tensor image analysis along the 
perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index, the burden of enlarged perivascular spaces 
(PVS), and choroid plexus volume to reflect glymphatic function. The 
relationships between WMH burden/Aβ aggregation and these glymphatic markers as 
well as the correlations between glymphatic markers and cognitive function were 
investigated. Furthermore, we conducted mediation analyses to explore the 
potential mediating effects of glymphatic markers in the relationship between 
WMH burden/Aβ aggregation and cognition.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three participants along the AD continuum were 
included, consisting of 40 CN - , 48 CN + , 26 MCI + , and 19 AD + participants. 
Our findings revealed that there were negative associations between whole-brain 
Aβ aggregation (r =  - 0.249, p = 0.022) and WMH burden (r =  - 0.458, 
p < 0.001) with DTI-ALPS. Additionally, Aβ aggregation (r = 0.223, p = 0.041) 
and WMH burden (r = 0.294, p = 0.006) were both positively associated with 
choroid plexus volume. However, we did not observe significant correlations with 
PVS enlargement severity. DTI-ALPS was positively associated with memory 
(r = 0.470, FDR-p < 0.001), executive function (r = 0.358, FDR-p = 0.001), 
visual-spatial (r = 0.223, FDR-p < 0.040), and language (r = 0.419, 
FDR-p < 0.001). Conversely, choroid plexus volume showed negative correlations 
with memory (r =  - 0.315, FDR-p = 0.007), executive function (r =  - 0.321, 
FDR-p = 0.007), visual-spatial (r =  - 0.233, FDR-p = 0.031), and language 
(r =  - 0.261, FDR-p = 0.021). There were no significant correlations between 
PVS enlargement severity and cognitive performance. In the mediation analysis, 
we found that DTI-ALPS acted as a mediator in the relationship between WMH 
burden/Aβ accumulation and memory and language performances.
CONCLUSION: Our study provided evidence that both AD pathology (Aβ) and CSVD 
were associated with glymphatic dysfunction, which is further related to 
cognitive impairment. These results may provide a theoretical basis for new 
targets for treating AD.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with a change in 
adjusted hippocampal volumes (HpVR: hippocampal/intracranial volume × 103) over 
time among cognitively normal older people.
METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of OA 
with HpVR among individuals with normal cognition (NC) from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. At baseline, a total of 372 
individuals with NC were included.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analyses of baseline data, we did not find a 
significant relationship between OA and HpVR among individuals with NC. However, 
in the longitudinal analyses, OA was significantly associated with change in 
HpVR over time among individuals with NC. Specifically, compared with 
individuals without OA, those with OA showed a faster decline in HpVR over time 
when controlling for other potential confounders, including age, educational 
attainment, gender, and APOE4 genotype.
CONCLUSION: OA status was significantly associated with a change in HpVR over 
time among individuals with NC.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) allows individuals and their health 
managers to manage healthier medication. We proposed an approach for 
classification of AD stages, with respect to principal component analysis 
(PCA)-based algorithm. The PCA has been extensively applied as the most 
auspicious face-recognition algorithm. For the proposed algorithm, 100 images of 
10 children were transformed for feature extraction and covariance matrix was 
constructed to obtain eigenvalues. The eigenvector provided a useful framework 
for face recognition. For the classification of AD stages, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were 
obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Hippocampus 
is one of the most affected regions by AD. Thus, we selected clusters of voxels 
from the "hippocampus" of AD screening stage (mild cognitive impairment), AD 
stage 1, AD stage 2, and AD stage 3. By using eigenvectors corresponding to 
maximum eigenvalues of fMRI data, the purposed algorithm classified the voxels 
of AD stages effectively.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a vulnerability state increasing the risk of many adverse 
health outcomes, but little is known about the effects of frailty on 
neuropsychiatric health.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between frailty and the risk of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in its 
different clinical stages.
METHODS: We included 2,155 individuals assessed using modified frailty index-11 
(mFI-11), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire (NPI-Q) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
The relationships between frailty and NPSs were explored with logistic 
regression models and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Causal 
mediation analyses were conducted to explore the mediation factors between 
frailty and NPSs.
RESULTS: Among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, frailty was 
cross-sectionally associated with an increased risk of apathy, and 
longitudinally associated with increased risk of depression and apathy. Among AD 
participants, frailty was cross-sectionally associated with increased risk of 
depression and anxiety, and longitudinally associated with an increased risk of 
apathy. Among participants with cognitive progression, frailty was associated 
with increased risk of depression and apathy. In MCI participants, the influence 
of frailty on NPSs was partially mediated by hippocampus volume, whole brain 
volume, and monocytes, with mediating proportions ranging from 8.40% to 9.29%.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with NPSs such as depression, anxiety, and 
apathy among MCI, AD, and cognitive progression participants. Atrophy of the 
hippocampus and whole brain, as well as peripheral immunity may be involved in 
the potential mechanisms underlying the above associations.

The use of imaging markers to predict clinical outcomes can have a great impact 
in public health. The aim of this paper is to develop a class of generalized 
scalar-on-image regression models via total variation (GSIRM-TV), in the sense 
of generalized linear models, for scalar response and imaging predictor with the 
presence of scalar covariates. A key novelty of GSIRM-TV is that it is assumed 
that the slope function (or image) of GSIRM-TV belongs to the space of bounded 
total variation in order to explicitly account for the piecewise smooth nature 
of most imaging data. We develop an efficient penalized total variation 
optimization to estimate the unknown slope function and other parameters. We 
also establish nonasymptotic error bounds on the excess risk. These bounds are 
explicitly specified in terms of sample size, image size, and image smoothness. 
Our simulations demonstrate a superior performance of GSIRM-TV against many 
existing approaches. We apply GSIRM-TV to the analysis of hippocampus data 
obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

The secondary prevention trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) require an 
enrichment strategy to recruit individuals with imminent cognitive decline at 
the preclinical stage. Previously, we demonstrated a variant neural correlates 
of episodic memory (EM) function in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers. Herein, 
we investigated whether this variation was associated with longitudinal EM 
performance. This 3-year longitudinal study included 88 normal elderly subjects 
with EM assessment and resting-state functional MRI data at baseline; 48 
subjects (27 ε3 homozygotes and 21 ε4 carriers) underwent follow-up EM 
assessment. In the identified EM neural correlates, multivariable regression 
models examined the association between hippocampal functional connectivity 
(HFC) and longitudinal EM change. Independent validation was performed using the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. At baseline, the EM 
neural correlates were characterized in the Papez circuit regions in the ε3 
homozygotes, but in the sensorimotor cortex and cuneus in the ε4 carriers. 
Longitudinally, the ε4 carriers exhibited a negative association of the baseline 
HFC strength in the EM neural correlates with annual rate of EM change 
(R2 = 0.25, p = 0.05). This association also showed a trend in the ADNI dataset 
(R2 = 0.42, p = 0.06). These results indicate that hippocampal hyperconnectivity 
in the variant EM neural correlates is associated with imminent EM decline in ε4 
carriers, which may serve as a promising enrichment strategy for secondary 
prevention trials of AD.

Insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and their receptors are highly 
expressed in the adult hippocampus. Thus, disturbances in the insulin-IGF 
signalling pathway may account for the selective vulnerability of the 
hippocampus to nascent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In the present study, 
we examined the predominant IGF-binding protein in the CSF, IGFBP2. CSF was 
collected from 109 asymptomatic members of the parental history-positive 
PREVENT-AD cohort. CSF levels of IGFBP2, core AD and synaptic biomarkers were 
measured using proximity extension assay, ELISA and mass spectrometry. Cortical 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition were examined using 18F-NAV4694 and 
flortaucipir. Cognitive assessments were performed during up to 8 years of 
follow-up, using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological 
Status. T1-weighted structural MRI scans were acquired, and neuroimaging 
analyses were performed on pre-specified temporal and parietal brain regions. 
Next, in an independent cohort, we allocated 241 dementia-free ADNI-1 
participants into four stages of AD progression based on the biomarkers CSF Aβ42 
and total-tau (t-tau). In this analysis, differences in CSF and plasma IGFBP2 
levels were examined across the pathological stages. Finally, IGFBP2 mRNA and 
protein levels were examined in the frontal cortex of 55 autopsy-confirmed AD 
and 31 control brains from the Quebec Founder Population (QFP) cohort, a unique 
population isolated from Eastern Canada. CSF IGFBP2 progressively increased over 
5 years in asymptomatic PREVENT-AD participants. Baseline CSF IGFBP2 was 
positively correlated with CSF AD biomarkers and synaptic biomarkers, and 
negatively correlated with longitudinal changes in delayed memory (P = 0.024) 
and visuospatial abilities (P = 0.019). CSF IGFBP2 was negatively correlated at 
a trend-level with entorhinal cortex volume (P = 0.082) and cortical thickness 
in the piriform (P = 0.039), inferior temporal (P = 0.008), middle temporal (P = 
0.014) and precuneus (P = 0.033) regions. In ADNI-1, CSF (P = 0.009) and plasma 
(P = 0.001) IGFBP2 were significantly elevated in Stage 2 [CSF Aβ(+)/t-tau(+)]. 
In survival analyses in ADNI-1, elevated plasma IGFBP2 was associated with a 
greater rate of AD conversion (hazard ratio = 1.62, P = 0.021). In the QFP 
cohort, IGFBP2 mRNA was reduced (P = 0.049); however, IGFBP2 protein levels did 
not differ in the frontal cortex of autopsy-confirmed AD brains (P = 0.462). 
Nascent AD pathology may induce an upregulation in IGFBP2 in asymptomatic 
individuals. CSF and plasma IGFBP2 may be valuable markers for identifying CSF 
Aβ(+)/t-tau(+) individuals and those with a greater risk of AD conversion.

INTRODUCTION: A harmonized protocol (HarP) for manual hippocampal segmentation 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently been developed by an 
international European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium-Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative project. We aimed at providing consensual certified HarP 
hippocampal labels in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space to 
serve as reference in automated image analyses.
METHODS: Manual HarP tracings on the high-resolution MNI152 standard space 
template of four expert certified HarP tracers were combined to obtain 
consensual bilateral hippocampus labels. Utility and validity of these reference 
labels is demonstrated in a simple atlas-based morphometry approach for 
automated calculation of HarP-compliant hippocampal volumes within SPM software.
RESULTS: Individual tracings showed very high agreement among the four expert 
tracers (pairwise Jaccard indices 0.82-0.87). Automatically calculated 
hippocampal volumes were highly correlated (rL/R = 0.89/0.91) with gold standard 
volumes in the HarP benchmark data set (N = 135 MRIs), with a mean volume 
difference of 9% (standard deviation 7%).
CONCLUSION: The consensual HarP hippocampus labels in the MNI152 template can 
serve as a reference standard for automated image analyses involving MNI 
standard space normalization.

IMPORTANCE: An increased tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal in the 
medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been observed in older individuals in the absence 
of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Little is known about the longitudinal course of 
this condition, and its association with Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To study the pathologic and clinical course of older individuals with 
PET-evidenced MTL tau deposition (TMTL+) in the absence of Aβ pathology (A-), 
and the association of this condition with the AD continuum.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicentric, observational, longitudinal 
cohort study was conducted using pooled data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS), and the 
AVID-A05 study, collected between July 2, 2015, and August 23, 2021. 
Participants in the ADNI, HABS, and AVID-A05 studies (N = 1093) with varying 
degrees of cognitive performance were deemed eligible if they had available tau 
PET, Aβ PET, and magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. Of these, 128 
participants did not meet inclusion criteria based on Aβ PET and tau PET 
biomarker profiles (A+ TMTL-).
EXPOSURES: Tau and Aβ PET, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers, and cognitive assessments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional and longitudinal measures for tau 
and Aβ PET, cortical atrophy, cognitive scores, and core AD cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 p-tau181 available 
in a subset).
RESULTS: Among the 965 individuals included in the study, 503 were women (52.1%) 
and the mean (SD) age was 73.9 (8.1) years. A total of 51% of A- individuals and 
78% of A+ participants had increased tau PET signal in the entorhinal cortex 
(TMTL+) compared with healthy younger (aged <39 years) controls. Compared with 
A- TMTL-, A- TMTL+ participants showed statistically significant, albeit 
moderate, longitudinal (mean [SD], 1.83 [0.84] years) tau PET increases that 
were largely limited to the temporal lobe, whereas those with A+ TMTL+ showed 
faster and more cortically widespread tau PET increases. In contrast to 
participants with A+ TMTL+, those with A- TMTL+ did not show any noticeable Aβ 
accumulation over follow-up (mean [SD], 2.36 [0.76] years). Complementary 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed longitudinal p-tau181 increases in A- 
TMTL+ in the absence of increased Aβ accumulation. Participants with A- TMTL+ 
had accelerated MTL atrophy, whereas those with A+ TMTL+ showed accelerated 
atrophy in widespread temporoparietal brain regions. Increased MTL tau PET 
uptake in A- individuals was associated with cognitive decline, but at a 
significantly slower rate compared with A+ TMTL+.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, individuals with A- TMTL+ exhibited 
progressive tau accumulation and neurodegeneration, but these processes were 
comparably slow, remained largely restricted to the MTL, were associated with 
only subtle changes in global cognitive performance, and were not accompanied by 
detectable accumulation of Aβ biomarkers. These data suggest that individuals 
with A- TMTL+ are not on a pathologic trajectory toward AD.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the interactive associations between amyloid and 
hypertension on the entorhinal cortex (EC) tau and atrophy and the role of 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a shared mechanism by which amyloid and 
hypertension contribute to EC tau and regional white matter hyperintensities 
(WMHs).
METHODS: We analyzed data from older adults without dementia participating in 
the Add-Tau study (NCT02958670, n = 138) or Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) (n = 523) who had available amyloid-positron emission 
tomography (PET), tau-PET, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and 
T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A subsample in both cohorts had 
available arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI (Add-Tau: n = 78; ADNI: n = 89).
RESULTS: The detrimental effects of hypertension on AD pathology and EC 
thickness were more pronounced in the Add-Tau cohort. Increased amyloid burden 
was associated with decreased occipital gray matter CBF in the ADNI cohort. In 
both cohorts, lower regional gray matter CBF was associated with higher EC tau 
and posterior WMH burden.
DISCUSSION: Reduced cerebral perfusion may be one common mechanism through which 
hypertension and amyloid are related to increased EC tau and WMH volume.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hypertension is associated with increased entorhinal cortex (EC) 
tau, particularly in the presence of amyloid. Decreased cortical cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) is associated with higher regional white matter hyperintensity 
volume. Increasing amyloid burden is associated with decreasing CBF in the 
occipital lobe. MTL CBF and amyloid are synergistically associated with EC tau.

Automatic and accurate segmentation of hippocampal structures in medical images 
is of great importance in neuroscience studies. In multi-atlas based 
segmentation methods, to alleviate the misalignment when registering atlases to 
the target image, patch-based methods have been widely studied to improve the 
performance of label fusion. However, weights assigned to the fused labels are 
usually computed based on predefined features (e.g. image intensities), thus 
being not necessarily optimal. Due to the lack of discriminating features, the 
original feature space defined by image intensities may limit the description 
accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a patch-based label fusion with 
structured discriminant embedding method to automatically segment the 
hippocampal structure from the target image in a voxel-wise manner. 
Specifically, multi-scale intensity features and texture features are first 
extracted from the image patch for feature representation. Margin fisher 
analysis (MFA) is then applied to the neighboring samples in the atlases for the 
target voxel, in order to learn a subspace in which the distance between 
intra-class samples is minimized and the distance between inter-class samples is 
simultaneously maximized. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier is 
employed in the learned subspace to determine the final label for the target 
voxel. In the experiments, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting 
hippocampus segmentation using the ADNI dataset. Both the qualitative and 
quantitative results show that our method outperforms the conventional 
multi-atlas based segmentation methods.

Hippocampal morphological change is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, whether hippocampal radiomic features are robust as 
predictors of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia 
and whether these features provide any neurobiological foundation remains 
unclear. The primary aim of this study was to verify whether hippocampal 
radiomic features can serve as robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers 
for AD. Multivariate classifier-based support vector machine (SVM) analysis 
provided individual-level predictions for distinguishing AD patients (n = 261) 
from normal controls (NCs; n = 231) with an accuracy of 88.21% and intersite 
cross-validation. Further analyses of a large, independent the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 1228) reinforced these 
findings. In MCI groups, a systemic analysis demonstrated that the identified 
features were significantly associated with clinical features (e.g., 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, polygenic risk scores, cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ, CSF Tau), and longitudinal changes in cognition ability; more 
importantly, the radiomic features had a consistently altered pattern with 
changes in the MMSE scores over 5 years of follow-up. These comprehensive 
results suggest that hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust 
biomarkers for clinical application in AD/MCI, and further provide evidence for 
predicting whether an MCI subject would convert to AD based on the radiomics of 
the hippocampus. The results of this study are expected to have a substantial 
impact on the early diagnosis of AD/MCI.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding the mechanisms of delusion formation in Alzheimer 
disease (AD) could inform the development of therapeutic interventions. It has 
been suggested that delusions arise as a consequence of false memories.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether delusions in AD are associated with false 
recognition, and whether higher rates of false recognition and the presence of 
delusions are associated with lower regional brain volumes in the same brain 
regions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Since the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) launched in 2004, it has amassed an archive of longitudinal 
behavioral and biomarker data. This cross-sectional study used data downloaded 
in 2020 from ADNI participants with an AD diagnosis at baseline or follow-up. 
Data analysis was performed between June 24, 2020, and September 21, 2021.
EXPOSURE: Enrollment in the ADNI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes included false recognition, 
measured with the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and 
volume of brain regions corrected for total intracranial volume. Behavioral data 
were compared for individuals with delusions in AD and those without using 
independent-samples t tests or Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests. Significant 
findings were further explored using binary logistic regression modeling. For 
neuroimaging data region of interest analyses using t tests, Poisson regression 
modeling or binary logistic regression modeling and further exploratory, 
whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses were carried out to explore the 
association between regional brain volume and false recognition or presence of 
delusions.
RESULTS: Of the 2248 individuals in the ADNI database, 728 met the inclusion 
criteria and were included in this study. There were 317 (43.5%) women and 411 
(56.5%) men. Their mean (SD) age was 74.8 (7.4) years. The 42 participants with 
delusions at baseline had higher rates of false recognition on the ADAS-Cog 13 
(median score, 3; IQR, 1 to 6) compared with the 549 control participants 
(median score, 2; IQR, 0 to 4; U = 9398.5; P = .04). False recognition was not 
associated with the presence of delusions when confounding variables were 
included in binary logistic regression models. An ADAS-Cog 13 false recognition 
score was inversely associated with left hippocampal volume (odds ratio [OR], 
0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.94], P < .001), right hippocampal volume (0.94 [0.92-0.97], 
P < .001), left entorhinal cortex volume (0.94 [0.91-0.97], P < .001), left 
parahippocampal gyrus volume (0.93 [0.91-0.96], P < .001), and left fusiform 
gyrus volume (0.97 [0.96-0.99], P < .001). There was no overlap between 
locations associated with false recognition and those associated with delusions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, false memories were 
not associated with the presence of delusions after accounting for confounding 
variables, and no indication for overlap of neural networks for false memories 
and delusions was observed on volumetric neuroimaging. These findings suggest 
that delusions in AD do not arise as a direct consequence of misremembering, 
lending weight to ongoing attempts to delineate specific therapeutic targets for 
treatment of psychosis.

BACKGROUND: APOE variants are strongly associated with abnormal amyloid 
aggregation and additional direct effects of APOE on tau aggregation are 
reported in animal and human cell models. The degree to which these effects are 
present in humans when individuals are clinically unimpaired (CU) but have 
abnormal amyloid (Aβ+) remains unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed data from CU individuals in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in 
Asymptomatic AD (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and 
Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies. Amyloid PET data were available for 4486 
participants (3163 Aβ-, 1323 Aβ+) and tau PET data were available for a subset 
of 447 participants (55 Aβ-, 392 Aβ+). Linear models examined APOE (number of e2 
and e4 alleles) associations with global amyloid and regional tau burden in 
medial temporal lobe (entorhinal, amygdala) and early neocortical regions 
(inferior temporal, inferior parietal, precuneus). Consistency of APOE4 effects 
on regional tau were examined in 220 Aβ + CU and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: APOE2 and APOE4 were associated with lower and higher amyloid 
positivity rates, respectively. Among Aβ+ CU, e2 and e4 were associated with 
reduced (-12 centiloids per allele) and greater (+15 centiloids per allele) 
continuous amyloid burden, respectively. APOE2 was associated with reduced 
regional tau in all regions (-0.05 to -0.09 SUVR per allele), whereas APOE4 was 
associated with greater regional tau (+0.02 to +0.07 SUVR per allele). APOE 
differences were confirmed by contrasting e3/e3 with e2/e3 and e3/e4. Mediation 
analyses among Aβ+ s showed that direct effects of e2 on regional tau were 
present in medial temporal lobe and early neocortical regions, beyond an 
indirect pathway mediated by continuous amyloid burden. For e4, direct effects 
on regional tau were only significant in medial temporal lobe. The magnitude of 
protective e2 effects on regional tau was consistent across brain regions, 
whereas detrimental e4 effects were greatest in medial temporal lobe. APOE4 
patterns were confirmed in Aβ+ ADNI participants.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE influences early regional tau PET burden, above and beyond 
effects related to cross-sectional amyloid PET burden. Therapeutic strategies 
targeting underlying mechanisms related to APOE may modify tau accumulation 
among Aβ+ individuals.

Mounting evidences have shown that progression of white matter hyperintensities 
(WMHs) with vascular origin might cause cognitive dysfunction symptoms through 
their effects on brain networks. However, the vulnerability of specific neural 
connection related to WMHs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) still remains unclear. In 
this study, we established an atlas-guided computational framework based on 
brain disconnectome to assess the spatial-temporal patterns of WMH-related 
structural disconnectivity within a longitudinal investigation. Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was adopted with 91, 90 and 44 
subjects including in cognitive normal aging, stable and progressive mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), respectively. The parcel-wise disconnectome was 
computed by indirect mapping of individual WMHs onto population-averaged 
tractography atlas. By performing chi-square test, we discovered a 
spatial-temporal pattern of brain disconnectome along AD evolution. When applied 
such pattern as predictor, our models achieved highest mean accuracy of 0.82, 
mean sensitivity of 0.86, mean specificity of 0.82 and mean area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 for predicting conversion 
from MCI to dementia, which outperformed methods utilizing lesion volume as 
predictors. Our analysis suggests that brain WMH-related structural 
disconnectome contributes to AD evolution mainly through attacking connections 
between: (1) parahippocampal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, orbital gyrus, 
and lateral occipital cortex; and (2) hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, which are 
also vulnerable to Aβ and tau confirmed by other researches. All the results 
further indicate that a synergistic relationship exists between multiple 
contributors of AD as they attack similar brain connectivity at the prodromal 
stage of disease.

Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images is very 
important in neuroscience studies. Recently, multi-atlas patch-based label 
fusion methods have achieved many successes, which generally represent each 
target patch from an atlas patch dictionary in the image domain and then predict 
the latent label by directly applying the estimated representation coefficients 
in the label domain. However, due to the large gap between these two domains, 
the estimated representation coefficients in the image domain may not stay 
optimal for the label fusion. To overcome this dilemma, we propose a novel label 
fusion framework to make the weighting coefficients eventually to be optimal for 
the label fusion by progressively constructing a dynamic dictionary in a 
layer-by-layer manner, where a sequence of intermediate patch dictionaries 
gradually encode the transition from the patch representation coefficients in 
image domain to the optimal weights for label fusion. Our proposed framework is 
general to augment the label fusion performance of the current state-of-the-art 
methods. In our experiments, we apply our proposed method to hippocampus 
segmentation on ADNI dataset and achieve more accurate labeling results, 
compared to the counterpart methods with single-layer dictionary.

BACKGROUND: Recent genetic research identified a protective factor against 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians, a variant called rs3747742-C 
in the TREML2 gene. However, the roles of other TREML2 variants in AD have not 
been fully explored.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a focused analysis of 16 TREML2 variants, examining 
their connection to AD by studying their correlation with cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) proteins, neuroimage, and cognition in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI).
METHODS: A multiple linear regression model was utilized to estimate potential 
associations between TREML2 genotypes and various endophenotypes in the entire 
ADNI sample at baseline, with age, gender, years of education, and APOE ɛ4 
status included as covariates. To examine changes in clinical outcomes over 
time, linear mixed-effects models were employed.
RESULTS: We found that the SNP rs17328707-A was associated with higher ADNI-VS 
scores, smaller ventricles, and larger middle temporal volume at baseline. The 
SNP rs6915083-G was linked to lower CSF t-tau and p-tau levels, and higher CSF 
Aβ levels. The SNP rs9394766-G was associated with a smaller hippocampus and 
larger ventricles at baseline. In longitudinal cohorts, the rs6915083-G SNP was 
associated with changes in ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF scores, as well as the rate of 
hippocampal and middle temporal atrophy.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that TREML2 gene variants have different effects 
on AD. Two variants are protective, while one may be a risk factor. This 
enhances our understanding of AD genetics and could guide future research and 
personalized treatments.

We examined moderation effects of sex and diagnosis on the effect of positive 
florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-β (Aβ) scan (A+) on 
hippocampus subfield volumes in 526 normal control (NC) and early mild cognitive 
impairment (eMCI) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI2; ADNI-GO). Regression moderation models showed that women- but 
not men- with NC designation did not show reduced subiculum volumes despite A+. 
At the eMCI stage, A+ was detrimental across sexes. Findings were significant 
while accounting for the effects of age, cognition at screening, education, and 
APOE4 carrier status. These findings suggest that women with A+ have early 
neural resistance to Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid burden.

The current study aimed to validate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical 
volumes measured by the automated segmentation tool Automatic Segmentation of 
Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS-T1). The study sample comprised 34 healthy controls 
(HCs), 37 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 29 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical 
volumes were assessed using ASHS-T1, manual segmentation, as well as a widely 
used automated segmentation tool, FreeSurfer v6.0.1. Mean differences, 
intraclass correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman plots were computed. 
ASHS-T1 tended to underestimate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes 
relative to manual segmentation and FreeSurfer. There was variable consistency 
and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and manual segmentation volumes. There was 
low-to-moderate consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and FreeSurfer 
volumes. There was a trend toward higher consistency and agreement for the 
entorhinal cortex in the aMCI and AD groups compared to the HC group. Despite 
the differences in volume measurements, ASHS-T1 was sensitive to entorhinal and 
transentorhinal cortical atrophy in both early and late disease stages. Based on 
the current study, ASHS-T1 appears to be a promising tool for automated 
entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volume measurement in individuals with 
likely underlying AD.

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has been considered to be a driving force of 
Alzheimer's disease. However, the association between peripheral immunity and AD 
has been rarely investigated.
METHODS: Separate regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations 
among peripheral immune markers and cognition, neuroimaging, and AD pathology. 
Causal mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the associations with 
cognition were mediated by AD pathology.
RESULTS: A total of 1107 participants (43.9% female, mean age of 73.2 years) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included. 
Regression analyses indicated that elevated neutrophils (NEU) count and 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were associated with lower levels of global 
cognition, memory function (MEM), and executive function (EF), and reduced brain 
metabolism by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as 
well as greater ventricular volume. An elevated NLR was associated with a lower 
level of β-amyloid (Aβ) and a higher level of total tau (T-tau) in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), smaller hippocampal volume (HV), and lesser entorhinal cortex (EC) 
thickness. On the contrary, an elevated level of lymphocytes (LYM) was 
associated with a higher level of Aβ and a lower level of T-tau in CSF, better 
cognition, and less atrophy of brain regions (ventricular volume, HV, and EC 
thickness). The associations of LYM and NLR with cognition were mediated by Aβ 
and T-tau pathology (proportion: 18%~64%; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that two types of peripheral immune cells (NEU and LYM) 
and the ratio of these two cell types (NLR) had associations with cognition, 
neuroimaging, and AD pathology. The associations might be mediated by Aβ and tau 
pathology.

Measurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and 
longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal 
volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable 
extremely fast T1-weighted scans (~1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that 
are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows 
multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool 
estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as "cluster 
scanning." Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a 
test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively 
unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment 
or Alzheimer's Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing 
(CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a 
traditional scan using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors 
that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. 
Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be 
achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. 
Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans 
(51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across 
multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of 
cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and 
produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: We investigate the role of osteopontin (OPN) in participants with 
Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
in AD brains.
METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) OPN, AD, and synaptic biomarker levels were 
measured in 109 cognitively unimpaired (CU), parental-history positive 
Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer's 
Disease (PREVENT-AD) participants, and in 167 CU and 399 participants with MCI 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. OPN levels 
were examined as a function of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau positivity. Survival 
analyses investigated the link between OPN and rate of conversion to AD.
RESULTS: In PREVENT-AD, CSF OPN was positively correlated with synaptic 
biomarkers. In PREVENT-AD and ADNI, OPN was elevated in CSF Aβ42/40(+)/total 
tau(+) and CSF Aβ42/40(+)/phosphorylated tau181(+) individuals. In ADNI, OPN was 
increased in Aβ(+) positron emission tomography (PET) and tau(+) PET 
individuals, and associated with an accelerated rate of conversion to AD. OPN 
was elevated in autopsy-confirmed AD brains.
DISCUSSION: Strong associations between CSF OPN and key markers of AD 
pathophysiology suggest a significant role for OPN in tau neurobiology, 
particularly in the early stages of the disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: In the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel 
Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease cohort, we discovered that cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) osteopontin (OPN) levels can indicate early synaptic dysfunction, 
tau deposition, and neuronal loss in cognitively unimpaired elderly with a 
parental history. CSF OPN is elevated in amyloid beta(+) positron emission 
tomography (PET) and tau(+) PET individuals. Elevated CSF OPN is associated with 
an accelerated rate of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated CSF OPN 
is associated with an accelerated rate of cognitive decline on the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale 13, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes. 
OPN mRNA and protein levels are significantly upregulated in the frontal cortex 
of autopsy-confirmed AD brains.

BACKGROUND: Individuals on the preclinical Alzheimer's continuum, particularly 
those with both amyloid and tau positivity (A + T +), display a rapid cognitive 
decline and elevated disease progression risk. However, limited studies exist on 
brain atrophy trajectories within this continuum over extended periods.
METHODS: This study involved 367 ADNI participants grouped based on combinations 
of amyloid and tau statuses determined through cerebrospinal fluid tests. Using 
longitudinal MRI scans, brain atrophy was determined according to the whole 
brain, lateral ventricle, and hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness in 
AD-signature regions. Cognitive performance was evaluated with the Preclinical 
Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). A generalized linear mixed-effects model 
was used to examine group × time interactions for these measures. In addition, 
progression risks to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia were compared 
among the groups using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: A total of 367 participants (48 A + T + , 86 A + T - , 63 A - T + , and 
170 A - T - ; mean age 73.8 years, mean follow-up 5.1 years, and 47.4% men) were 
included. For the lateral ventricle and PACC score, the A + T - and 
A + T + groups demonstrated statistically significantly greater volume expansion 
and cognitive decline over time than the A - T - group (lateral ventricle: 
β = 0.757 cm3/year [95% confidence interval 0.463 to 1.050], P < .001 for 
A + T - , and β = 0.889 cm3/year [0.523 to 1.255], P < .001 for A + T + ; PACC: 
β =  - 0.19 /year [- 0.36 to - 0.02], P = .029 for A + T - , and β =  - 0.59 
/year [- 0.80 to - 0.37], P < .001 for A + T +). Notably, the A + T + group 
exhibited additional brain atrophy including the whole brain (β =  - 2.782 
cm3/year [- 4.060 to - 1.504], P < .001), hippocampus (β =  - 0.057 cm3/year 
[- 0.085 to - 0.029], P < .001), and AD-signature regions (β =  - 0.02 mm/year 
[- 0.03 to - 0.01], P < .001). Cox proportional hazards models suggested an 
increased risk of progressing to MCI or dementia in the A + T + group versus the 
A - T - group (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.35 [1.76 to 6.39]).
CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal individuals, A + T + compounds brain atrophy 
and cognitive deterioration, amplifying the likelihood of disease progression. 
Therapeutic interventions targeting A + T + individuals could be pivotal in 
curbing brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Leveraging Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarkers and 
longitudinal cognitive data may allow us to establish evidence of cognitive 
resilience (CR) to AD pathology in-vivo. Here, we applied latent class mixture 
modeling, adjusting for sex, baseline age, and neuroimaging biomarkers of 
amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration, to a sample of cognitively unimpaired older 
adults to identify longitudinal trajectories of CR.
METHODS: We identified 200 Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) participants (mean 
age = 71.89 years, SD = 9.41 years, 59% women) who were cognitively unimpaired 
at baseline with 2 or more timepoints of cognitive assessment following a single 
amyloid-PET, tau-PET and structural MRI. We examined latent class mixture models 
with longitudinal cognition as the dependent variable and time from baseline, 
baseline age, sex, neocortical Aβ, entorhinal tau, and adjusted hippocampal 
volume as independent variables. We then examined group differences in 
CR-related factors across the identified subgroups from a favored model. 
Finally, we applied our favored model to a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 160, mean age = 73.9 years, SD = 7.6 years, 
60% women).
RESULTS: The favored model identified 3 latent subgroups, which we labelled as 
Normal (71% of HABS sample), Resilient (22.5%) and Declining (6.5%) subgroups. 
The Resilient subgroup exhibited higher baseline cognitive performance and a 
stable cognitive slope. They were differentiated from other groups by higher 
levels of verbal intelligence and past cognitive activity. In ADNI, this model 
identified a larger Normal subgroup (88.1%), a smaller Resilient subgroup (6.3%) 
and a Declining group (5.6%) with a lower cognitive baseline.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the value of data-driven approaches to 
identify longitudinal CR groups in preclinical AD. With such an approach, we 
identified a CR subgroup who reflected expected characteristics based on 
previous literature, higher levels of verbal intelligence and past cognitive 
activity.

BACKGROUND: Increasing research suggests that gait abnormalities can be a risk 
factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Notably, there is growing evidence 
highlighting this risk factor in individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (aMCI), however further studies are needed. The aim of this study is 
to analyze cognitive tests results and brain-related measures over time in aMCI 
and examine how the presence of gait abnormalities (neurological or orthopedic) 
or normal gait affects these trends. Additionally, we sought to assess the 
significance of gait and gait-related measures as prognostic indicators for the 
progression from aMCI to AD dementia, comparing those who converted to AD with 
those who remained with a stable aMCI diagnosis during the follow-up.
METHODS: Four hundred two individuals with aMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were included. Robust linear 
mixed-effects models were used to study the impact of gait abnormalities on a 
comprehensive neuropsychological battery over 36 months while controlling for 
relevant medical variables at baseline. The impact of gait on brain measures was 
also investigated. Lastly, the Cox proportional-hazards model was used to 
explore the prognostic relevance of abnormal gait and neuropsychological 
associated tests.
RESULTS: While controlling for relevant covariates, we found that gait 
abnormalities led to a greater decline over time in attention (DSST) and global 
cognition (MMSE). Intriguingly, psychomotor speed (TMT-A) and divided attention 
(TMT-B) declined uniquely in the abnormal gait group. Conversely, specific AD 
global cognition tests (ADAS-13) and auditory-verbal memory (RAVLT immediate 
recall) declined over time independently of gait profile. All the other 
cognitive tests were not significantly affected by time or by gait profile. In 
addition, we found that ventricles size increased faster in the abnormal gait 
group compared to the normal gait group. In terms of prognosis, abnormal gait 
(HR = 1.7), MMSE (HR = 1.09), and DSST (HR = 1.03) covariates showed a higher 
impact on AD dementia conversion.
CONCLUSIONS: The importance of the link between gait and related cognitive 
functions in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and rehabilitation in aMCI is 
critical. We showed that in aMCI gait abnormalities lead to executive 
functions/attention deterioration and conversion to AD dementia.

The effectiveness of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a useful 
evaluation tool strongly depends on the performed segmentation of associated 
tissues or anatomical structures. We introduce an enhanced brain segmentation 
approach of Bayesian label fusion that includes the construction of adaptive 
target-specific probabilistic priors using atlases ranked by kernel-based 
similarity metrics to deal with the anatomical variability of collected MRI 
data. In particular, the developed segmentation approach appraises patch-based 
voxel representation to enhance the voxel embedding in spaces with increased 
tissue discrimination, as well as the construction of a neighborhood-dependent 
model that addresses the label assignment of each region with a different patch 
complexity. To measure the similarity between the target and training atlases, 
we propose a tensor-based kernel metric that also includes the training labeling 
set. We evaluate the proposed approach, adaptive Bayesian label fusion using 
kernel-based similarity metrics, in the specific case of hippocampus 
segmentation of five benchmark MRI collections, including ADNI dataset, 
resulting in an increased performance (assessed through the Dice index) as 
compared to other recent works.

Ventriculomegaly (expansion of the brain's fluid-filled ventricles), a condition 
commonly found in the aging brain, results in areas of gliosis where the 
ependymal cells are replaced with dense astrocytic patches. Loss of ependymal 
cells would compromise trans-ependymal bulk flow mechanisms required for 
clearance of proteins and metabolites from the brain parenchyma. However, little 
is known about the interplay between age-related ventricle expansion, the 
decline in ependymal integrity, altered periventricular fluid homeostasis, 
abnormal protein accumulation and cognitive impairment. In collaboration with 
the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we analyzed longitudinal structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and subject-matched fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR) MRI and periventricular biospecimens to map spatiotemporally the 
progression of ventricle expansion and associated periventricular edema and loss 
of transependymal exchange functions in healthy aging individuals and those with 
varying degrees of cognitive impairment. We found that the trajectory of 
ventricle expansion and periventricular edema progression correlated with degree 
of cognitive impairment in both speed and severity, and confirmed that areas of 
expansion showed ventricle surface gliosis accompanied by edema and 
periventricular accumulation of protein aggregates, suggesting impaired 
clearance mechanisms in these regions. These findings reveal pathophysiological 
outcomes associated with normal brain aging and cognitive impairment, and 
indicate that a multifactorial analysis is best suited to predict and monitor 
cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease accounts for approximately 70% of 
all dementia cases. Cortical and hippocampal atrophy caused by Alzheimer's 
disease can be appreciated easily from a T1-weighted structural magnetic 
resonance scan. Since a timely therapeutic intervention during the initial 
stages of the syndrome has a positive impact on both disease progression and 
quality of life of affected subjects, Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is crucial. 
Thus, this study relies on the development of a robust yet lightweight 3D 
framework, Brain-on-Cloud, dedicated to efficient learning of Alzheimer's 
disease-related features from 3D structural magnetic resonance whole-brain scans 
by improving our recent convolutional long short-term memory-based framework 
with the integration of a set of data handling techniques in addition to the 
tuning of the model hyper-parameters and the evaluation of its diagnostic 
performance on independent test data.
METHODS: For this objective, four serial experiments were conducted on a 
scalable GPU cloud service. They were compared and the hyper-parameters of the 
best experiment were tuned until reaching the best-performing configuration. In 
parallel, two branches were designed. In the first branch of Brain-on-Cloud, 
training, validation and testing were performed on OASIS-3. In the second 
branch, unenhanced data from ADNI-2 were employed as independent test set, and 
the diagnostic performance of Brain-on-Cloud was evaluated to prove its 
robustness and generalization capability. The prediction scores were computed 
for each subject and stratified according to age, sex and mini mental state 
examination.
RESULTS: In its best guise, Brain-on-Cloud is able to discriminate Alzheimer's 
disease with an accuracy of 92% and 76%, sensitivity of 94% and 82%, and area 
under the curve of 96% and 92% on OASIS-3 and independent ADNI-2 test data, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Brain-on-Cloud shows to be a reliable, lightweight and 
easily-reproducible framework for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
from 3D structural magnetic resonance whole-brain scans, performing well without 
segmenting the brain into its portions. Preserving the brain anatomy, its 
application and diagnostic ability can be extended to other cognitive disorders. 
Due to its cloud nature, computational lightness and fast execution, it can also 
be applied in real-time diagnostic scenarios providing prompt clinical decision 
support.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) are 
putative non-amyloid biomarkers indicative of ongoing inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative disease processes. Hence, this study aimed to demonstrate the 
relationship between plasma biomarkers (GFAP and NfL) and 18F-AV-1451 tau PET 
images, and to explore their effects on cognitive function. Ninety-one 
participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database and 20 participants from the Shanghai Action of Prevention Dementia for 
the Elderly (SHAPE) cohort underwent plasma biomarker testing, 18F-AV-1451 tau 
PET scans and cognitive function assessments. Within the ADNI, there were 42 
cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 49 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Similarly, in the SHAPE, we had 10 CN and 10 MCI participants. We calculated the 
standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for the regions of interest (ROIs) in 
the 18F-AV-1451 PET scans. Using plasma biomarkers and regional SUVRs, we 
trained machine learning models to differentiate between MCI and CN subjects 
with ADNI database and validated in SHAPE. Results showed that eight selected 
variables (including left amygdala SUVR, right amygdala SUVR, left entorhinal 
cortex SUVR, age, education, plasma NfL, plasma GFAP, plasma GFAP/ NfL) 
identified by LASSO could differentiate between the MCI and CN individuals, with 
AUC ranging from 0.783 to 0.926. Additionally, cognitive function was negatively 
associated with the plasma biomarkers and tau deposition in amygdala and left 
entorhinal cortex. Increased tau deposition in amygdala and left entorhinal 
cortex were related to increased plasma biomarkers. Moreover, tau pathology 
mediated the effect of plasma biomarkers level on the cognitive decline. The 
present study provides valuable insights into the association among plasma 
markers (GFAP and NfL), regional tau deposition and cognitive function. This 
study reports the mediation effect of brain regions tau deposition on the plasma 
biomarkers level and cognitive function, indicating the significance of tau 
pathology in the MCI patients.

We consider a functional linear Cox regression model for characterizing the 
association between time-to-event data and a set of functional and scalar 
predictors. The functional linear Cox regression model incorporates a functional 
principal component analysis for modeling the functional predictors and a 
high-dimensional Cox regression model to characterize the joint effects of both 
functional and scalar predictors on the time-to-event data. We develop an 
algorithm to calculate the maximum approximate partial likelihood estimates of 
unknown finite and infinite dimensional parameters. We also systematically 
investigate the rate of convergence of the maximum approximate partial 
likelihood estimates and a score test statistic for testing the nullity of the 
slope function associated with the functional predictors. We demonstrate our 
estimation and testing procedures by using simulations and the analysis of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Our real data analyses 
show that high-dimensional hippocampus surface data may be an important marker 
for predicting time to conversion to Alzheimer's disease. Data used in the 
preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database 
(adni.loni.usc.edu).

OBJECTIVE: There is a shred of growing evidence demonstrating that diabetic 
patients are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to the 
general population. The previous investigation showed the protective effect of 
metformin for delaying dementia in diabetic patients. However, there are limited 
data on the effect of metformin on structural changes. This study aims to 
investigate the effect of metformin on hippocampal and cortical volumes in 
non-demented diabetic individuals.
METHOD: We entered 157 non-demented diabetic subjects including 89 mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 68 cognitively healthy individuals from 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) which were then categorized 
as metformin users and non-users. We used the ANCOVA model for measuring the 
association between metformin use and hippocampal and cortical volumes.
RESULTS: Among 157 subjects with a mean age of 71.8 (±7.7) included in this 
study, 76 individuals were stratified as metformin users. Results of the 
univariate model indicate that metformin users had a higher right (p = 0.003) 
and left parietal lobe volume (p = 0.004). Moreover, the volume of left 
cingulate was higher in those who used metformin compared to those not used it 
(p = 0.027). Our results were also significant for the right frontal lobe and 
indicated that metformin users had higher volume (p = 0.035). There were no 
significant differences in the hippocampus, occipital, and temporal regions.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed the protective effects of metformin on brain 
volumes in non-demented elderly individuals with diabetes. Comparing the groups 
show strong enough results regarding the lower atrophy in metformin users.

BACKGROUND: Hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been linked to more 
severe cognitive and functional decline. However, research on visual 
hallucinations (VH), the most common type of hallucinations in AD, is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cognitive and cerebral macrostructural and 
metabolic features associated with VH in AD.
METHODS: Twenty-four AD patients with VH, 24 with no VH (NVH), and 24 
cognitively normal (CN) matched controls were selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Differences in regional gray 
matter (GM) volumes and cognitive performance were investigated with whole brain 
voxel-based morphometry analyses of MRI structural brain scans, and analyses of 
neuropsychological tests. Glucose metabolic changes were explored in a 
sub-sample of patients who had FDG-PET scans available.
RESULTS: More severe visuoconstructive and attentional deficits were found in AD 
VH compared with NVH. GM atrophy and hypometabolism were detected in occipital 
and temporal areas in VH patients in comparison with CN. On the other hand, NVH 
patients had atrophy and hypometabolism mainly in temporal areas. No differences 
in GM volume and glucose metabolism were found in the direct comparison between 
AD VH and NVH.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the pattern of brain abnormalities typical of AD, 
occipital alterations were observed in patients with VH compared with CN. More 
severe visuoconstructive and attentional deficits were found in AD VH when 
directly compared with NVH, and might contribute to the emergence of VH in AD.

BACKGROUND: Synaptic degeneration has been suggested as an early pathological 
event that strongly correlates with severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, changes in longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) as a synaptic biomarker in the AD 
continuum remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the trajectory of CSF GAP-43 with AD progression and its 
association with other AD hallmarks.
METHODS: CSF GAP-43 was analyzed in 788 participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 246 cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals, 415 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 127 with 
AD dementia based on cognitive assessments. The associations between a 
multimodal classification scheme with amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and 
neurodegeneration, and changes in CSF GAP-43 over time were also analyzed.
RESULTS: CSF GAP-43 levels were increased at baseline in MCI and dementia 
patients, and increased significantly over time in the preclinical (Aβ-positive 
CN), prodromal (Aβ-positive MCI), and dementia (Aβ-positive dementia) stages of 
AD. Higher levels of CSF GAP-43 were also associated with higher CSF 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and total tau (t-tau), cerebral amyloid deposition 
and hypometabolism on positron emission tomography, the hippocampus and middle 
temporal atrophy, and cognitive performance deterioration at baseline and 
follow-up. Furthermore, CSF GAP-43 may assist in effectively predicting the 
probability of dementia onset at 2- or 4-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: CSF GAP-43 can be used as a potential biomarker associated with 
synaptic degeneration in subjects with AD; it may also be useful for tracking 
the disease progression and for monitoring the effects of clinical trials.

Subclinical depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the brain mechanisms underlying this relationship 
are still unclear. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the brain 
substrates of subclinical depressive symptoms in cognitively unimpaired older 
adults using complementary multimodal neuroimaging data. We included cognitively 
unimpaired older adults from the baseline data of the primary cohort Age-Well 
(n = 135), and from the replication cohort ADNI (n = 252). In both cohorts, 
subclinical depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item version of the 
Geriatric Depression Scale; based on this scale, participants were classified as 
having depressive symptoms (>0) or not (0). Voxel-wise between-group comparisons 
were performed to highlight differences in gray matter volume, glucose 
metabolism and amyloid deposition; as well as white matter integrity (only 
available in Age-Well). Age-Well participants with subclinical depressive 
symptoms had lower gray matter volume in the hippocampus and lower white matter 
integrity in the fornix and the posterior parts of the cingulum and corpus 
callosum, compared to participants without symptoms. Hippocampal atrophy was 
recovered in ADNI, where participants with subclinical depressive symptoms also 
showed glucose hypometabolism in the hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus/posterior 
cingulate cortex, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and 
temporoparietal cortex. Subclinical depressive symptoms were not associated with 
brain amyloid deposition in either cohort. Subclinical depressive symptoms in 
ageing are linked with neurodegeneration biomarkers in the frontolimbic network 
including brain areas particularly sensitive to AD. The relationship between 
depressive symptoms and AD may be partly underpinned by neurodegeneration in 
common brain regions.

BACKGROUND: The hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fusiform gyrus are brain 
areas that deteriorate during early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ApoE4 
allele has been identified as a risk factor for AD development, is linked to an 
increase in the aggregation of amyloid ß (Aß) plaques in the brain, and is 
responsible for atrophy of the hippocampal area. However, to our knowledge, the 
rate of deterioration over time in individuals with AD, with or without the 
ApoE4 allele, has not been investigated.
METHOD: In this study, we, for the first time, analyze atrophy in these brain 
structures in AD patients with and without the ApoE4 using the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.
RESULTS: It was found that the rate of decrease in the volume of these brain 
areas over 12 months was related to the presence of ApoE4. Further, we found 
that neural atrophy was not different for female and male patients, unlike prior 
studies, suggesting that the presence of ApoE4 is not linked to the gender 
difference in AD.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm and extend previous findings, showing that the 
ApoE4 allele gradually impacts brain regions impacted by AD.

The diagnostic and clinical overlap of early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and 
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a vital oncological issue in dementia disorder. This 
study is designed to examine Whole brain (WB), grey matter (GM) and Hippocampus 
(HC) morphological variation and identify the prominent biomarkers in MR brain 
images of demented subjects to understand the severity progression. Curve 
evolution based on shape constraint is carried out to segment the complex brain 
structure such as HC and GM. Pre-trained models are used to observe the severity 
variation in these regions. This work is evaluated on ADNI database. The outcome 
of the proposed work shows that curve evolution method could segment HC and GM 
regions with better correlation. Pre-trained models are able to show significant 
severity difference among WB, GM and HC regions for the considered classes. 
Further, prominent variation is observed between AD vs. EMCI, AD vs. MCI and AD 
vs. LMCI in the whole brain, GM and HC. It is concluded that AlexNet model for 
HC region result in better classification for AD vs. EMCI, AD vs. MCI and AD vs. 
LMCI with an accuracy of 93, 78.3 and 91% respectively.

Large neuroimaging datasets, including information about structural connectivity 
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC), play an increasingly important role in 
clinical research, where they guide the design of algorithms for automated 
stratification, diagnosis or prediction. A major obstacle is, however, the 
problem of missing features [e.g., lack of concurrent DTI SC and resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) FC measurements for many of the 
subjects]. We propose here to address the missing connectivity features problem 
by introducing strategies based on computational whole-brain network modeling. 
Using two datasets, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset and a healthy aging dataset, for proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the 
feasibility of virtual data completion (i.e., inferring "virtual FC" from 
empirical SC or "virtual SC" from empirical FC), by using self-consistent 
simulations of linear and nonlinear brain network models. Furthermore, by 
performing machine learning classification (to separate age classes or control 
from patient subjects), we show that algorithms trained on virtual connectomes 
achieve discrimination performance comparable to when trained on actual 
empirical data; similarly, algorithms trained on virtual connectomes can be used 
to successfully classify novel empirical connectomes. Completion algorithms can 
be combined and reiterated to generate realistic surrogate connectivity matrices 
in arbitrarily large number, opening the way to the generation of virtual 
connectomic datasets with network connectivity information comparable to the one 
of the original data.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD). Prior research shows that females are more impacted by MCI than males. On 
average females have a greater incidence rate of any dementia and current 
evidence suggests that they suffer greater cognitive deterioration than males in 
the same disease stage. Recent research has linked these sex differences to 
neuroimaging markers of brain pathology, such as hippocampal volumes. 
Specifically, the rate of hippocampal atrophy affects the progression of AD in 
females more than males. This study was designed to extend our understanding of 
the sex-related differences in the brain of participants with MCI. Specifically, 
we investigated the difference in the hippocampal connectivity to different 
areas of the brain. The Resting State fMRI and T2 MRI of cognitively normal 
individuals (n = 40, female = 20) and individuals with MCI (n = 40, female = 20) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed using 
the Functional Connectivity Toolbox (CONN). Our results demonstrate that 
connectivity of hippocampus to the precuneus cortex and brain stem was 
significantly stronger in males than in females. These results improve our 
current understanding of the role of hippocampus-precuneus cortex and 
hippocampus-brainstem connectivity in sex differences in MCI. Understanding the 
contribution of impaired functional connectivity sex differences may aid in the 
development of sex specific precision medicine to manipulate 
hippocampal-precuneus cortex and hippocampal-brainstem connectivity to decrease 
the progression of MCI to AD.

This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional associations between 
regional Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including tau, β-amyloid (Aβ), and 
brain volume, within the Papez circuit, and neuropsychological functioning 
across the preclinical and clinical spectrum of AD. We utilized data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 251 
Aβ-positive participants. Participants were categorized into three groups based 
on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR): 73 individuals with preclinical AD 
(CDR = 0), 114 with prodromal AD (CDR = 0.5), and 64 with clinical AD dementia 
(CDR ≥ 1). Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, gender, and education 
years, were employed to evaluate the associations between five regions of 
interest (the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior 
cingulate cortex, and thalamus) and five neuropsychological tests across the 
three imaging modalities. In the preclinical stage of AD, flortaucipir PET was 
associated with impaired global cognition and episodic memory (range 
standardized β = 0.255-0.498, p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons), 
while florbetapir PET and brain volume were marginally related to global 
cognition (range standardized β = 0.221-0.231, p < 0.05). In the clinical stages 
of AD (prodromal and dementia), both increased flortaucipir uptake and decreased 
brain volume were significantly associated with poorer global neuropsychological 
and episodic memory performance (range standardized β = 0.222-0.621, p < 0.05, 
most regions of interest survived correction for multiple comparisions). 
However, a slight relationship was observed between florbetapir uptake and 
poorer global cognitive function. The regions most affected by flortaucipir PET 
were the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. During 
the clinical stages, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibited the most 
significant volumetric changes. Tau PET and brain volume measurements within the 
Papez circuit are more sensitive indicators of early cognitive deficits in AD 
than Aβ PET. Furthermore, during the clinical stages of AD, both flortaucipir 
PET and brain volume of the Papez circuit are closely correlated with cognitive 
decline. These findings underscore the importance of integrating multiple 
biomarkers for the comprehensive evaluation of AD pathology and its impact on 
cognition.

Attention-Guided Hybrid Network for Dementia Diagnosis With Structural MR 
Images.

Lian C, Liu M, Pan Y, Shen D.

Deep-learning methods (especially convolutional neural networks) using 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data have been successfully applied 
to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal 
stage [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. As it is practically challenging 
to capture local and subtle disease-associated abnormalities directly from the 
whole-brain sMRI, most of those deep-learning approaches empirically preselect 
disease-associated sMRI brain regions for model construction. Considering that 
such isolated selection of potentially informative brain locations might be 
suboptimal, very few methods have been proposed to perform disease-associated 
discriminative region localization and disease diagnosis in a unified 
deep-learning framework. However, those methods based on task-oriented 
discriminative localization still suffer from two common limitations, that is: 
1) identified brain locations are strictly consistent across all subjects, which 
ignores the unique anatomical characteristics of each brain and 2) only limited 
local regions/patches are used for model training, which does not fully utilize 
the global structural information provided by the whole-brain sMRI. In this 
article, we propose an attention-guided deep-learning framework to extract 
multilevel discriminative sMRI features for dementia diagnosis. Specifically, we 
first design a backbone fully convolutional network to automatically localize 
the discriminative brain regions in a weakly supervised manner. Using the 
identified disease-related regions as spatial attention guidance, we further 
develop a hybrid network to jointly learn and fuse multilevel sMRI features for 
CAD model construction. Our proposed method was evaluated on three public 
datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and AIBL), showing superior performance compared 
with several state-of-the-art methods in both tasks of AD diagnosis and MCI 
conversion prediction.

OBJECTIVE: Since apathy increases in prevalence with severity of dementia 
pathology, we sought to distinguish concomitant neurodegenerative processes from 
brain differences associated with apathy in persons with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We examined relative structural 
brain differences between case-control matched cognitively impaired patients 
with and without apathy.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study.
SETTING: Fifty-eight clinical sites in phase 2 of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
across the United States and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: The ≥ 55 years of age with MCI or AD dementia and no major 
neurological disorders aside from suspected incipient AD dementia. Participants 
with apathy (n=69) were age-, sex-, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carrier status-, 
Mini-Mental State Exam score-, and MCI or AD dementia diagnosis-matched to 
participants without apathy (n=149).
INTERVENTIONS: The 3-tesla T1-weighted MRI scan and neurocognitive assessments. 
Using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy domain scores, participants were 
dichotomized into a with-apathy group (score ≥ 1) and a without-apathy group 
(score = 0).
MEASUREMENTS: Cortical thicknesses from 24 a priori regions of interest involved 
in frontostriatal circuits and frontotemporal association areas.
RESULTS: False-discovery rate adjusted within-group comparisons between 
participants with apathy and participants without apathy showed thinner right 
medial orbitofrontal (mOFC; 
meandifference(MD)±standarderrorofMD(SE)=-0.0879±0.0257mm; 
standardizedMD(d)=-0.4456) and left rostral anterior cingulate (rACC; 
MD±SE=-0.0905±0.0325mm; d=-0.3574) cortices and thicker left middle temporal 
cortices (MTC; MD±SE=0.0688±0.0239mm; d=0.3311) in those with apathy.
CONCLUSION: Atrophy of the right mOFC and left rACC and sparing of atrophy in 
the left MTC are associated with apathy in cognitively impaired persons.

INTRODUCTION: Advances in image segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) 
have demonstrated that multi-atlas approaches improve segmentation over regular 
atlas-based approaches. These approaches often rely on a large number of 
manually segmented atlases (e.g. 30-80) that take significant time and expertise 
to produce. We present an algorithm, MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically 
Generated Templates), for the automatic segmentation of the hippocampus that 
minimises the number of atlases needed whilst still achieving similar agreement 
to multi-atlas approaches. Thus, our method acts as a reliable multi-atlas 
approach when using special or hard-to-define atlases that are laborious to 
construct.
METHOD: MAGeT-Brain works by propagating atlas segmentations to a template 
library, formed from a subset of target images, via transformations estimated by 
nonlinear image registration. The resulting segmentations are then propagated to 
each target image and fused using a label fusion method. We conduct two separate 
Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments comparing MAGeT-Brain and basic 
multi-atlas whole hippocampal segmentation using differing atlas and template 
library sizes, and registration and label fusion methods. The first experiment 
is a 10-fold validation (per parameter setting) over 60 subjects taken from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), and the second is a five-fold 
validation over 81 subjects having had a first episode of psychosis. In both 
cases, automated segmentations are compared with manual segmentations following 
the Pruessner-protocol. Using the best settings found from these experiments, we 
segment 246 images of the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5 T dataset and compare these 
with segmentations from existing automated and semi-automated methods: FSL 
FIRST, FreeSurfer, MAPER, and SNT. Finally, we conduct a leave-one-out 
cross-validation of hippocampal subfield segmentation in standard 3T T1-weighted 
images, using five high-resolution manually segmented atlases (Winterburn et 
al., 2013).
RESULTS: In the ADNI cross-validation, using 9 atlases MAGeT-Brain achieves a 
mean Dice's Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 0.869 with respect to manual 
whole hippocampus segmentations, and also exhibits significantly lower 
variability in DSC scores than multi-atlas segmentation. In the younger, 
psychosis dataset, MAGeT-Brain achieves a mean DSC score of 0.892 and produces 
volumes which agree with manual segmentation volumes better than those produced 
by the FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST methods (mean difference in volume: 80 mm(3), 
1600 mm(3), and 800 mm(3), respectively). Similarly, in the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 
1.5 T dataset, MAGeT-Brain produces hippocampal segmentations well correlated 
(r>0.85) with SNT semi-automated reference volumes within disease categories, 
and shows a conservative bias and a mean difference in volume of 250 mm(3) 
across the entire dataset, compared with FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST which both 
overestimate volume differences by 2600 mm(3) and 2800 mm(3) on average, 
respectively. Finally, MAGeT-Brain segments the CA1, CA4/DG and subiculum 
subfields on standard 3T T1-weighted resolution images with DSC overlap scores 
of 0.56, 0.65, and 0.58, respectively, relative to manual segmentations.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain produces consistent whole 
hippocampal segmentations using only 9 atlases, or fewer, with various 
hippocampal definitions, disease populations, and image acquisition types. 
Additionally, we show that MAGeT-Brain identifies hippocampal subfields in 
standard 3T T1-weighted images with overlap scores comparable to competing 
methods.

Background: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been widely used to investigate 
structural alterations in amnesia mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, 
inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the exact neuropathology 
related to aMCI. Objectives: Our aim was to systematically review the literature 
reporting VBM on aMCI to elucidate consistent gray matter alterations, their 
functional characterization, and corresponding co-activation patterns. Methods: 
The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for VBM studies 
on aMCI published from inception up to June 2020. Peak coordinates were 
extracted from clusters that showed significant gray matter differences between 
aMCI patients and healthy controls (HC). Meta-analysis was performed using 
seed-based d mapping with the permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI), a newly 
improved meta-analytic method. Functional characterization and task-based 
co-activation patterns using the BrainMap database were performed on significant 
clusters to explore their functional roles. Finally, VBM was performed based on 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to further 
support the findings. Results: A total of 31 studies with 681 aMCI patients and 
837 HC were included in this systematic review. The aMCI group showed 
significant gray matter atrophy in the left amygdala and right hippocampus, 
which was consistent with results from the ADNI dataset. Functional 
characterization revealed that these regions were mainly associated with 
emotion, cognition, and perception. Further, meta-regression analysis 
demonstrated that gray matter atrophy in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the 
left angular gyrus was significantly associated with cognitive impairment in the 
aMCI group. Conclusions: The findings of gray matter atrophy in the left 
amygdala and right hippocampus are highly consistent and robust, and not only 
offer a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology but also provide 
accurate potential biomarkers for aMCI.

Alzheimer's disease involves many neurobiological alterations from molecular to 
macroscopic spatial scales, but we currently lack integrative, mechanistic brain 
models characterizing how factors across different biological scales interact to 
cause clinical deterioration in a way that is subject-specific or personalized. 
As important signalling molecules and mediators of many neurobiological 
interactions, neurotransmitter receptors are promising candidates for 
identifying molecular mechanisms and drug targets in Alzheimer's disease. We 
present a neurotransmitter receptor-enriched multifactorial brain model, which 
integrates spatial distribution patterns of 15 neurotransmitter receptors from 
post-mortem autoradiography with multiple in vivo neuroimaging modalities (tau, 
amyloid-β and glucose PET, and structural, functional and arterial spin 
labelling MRI) in a personalized, generative, whole-brain formulation. In a 
heterogeneous aged population (n = 423, ADNI data), models with personalized 
receptor-neuroimaging interactions showed a significant improvement over 
neuroimaging-only models, explaining about 70% (±20%) of the variance in 
longitudinal changes to the six neuroimaging modalities. In Alzheimer's disease 
patients (n = 25, ADNI data), receptor-imaging interactions explained up to 
39.7% (P < 0.003, family-wise error-rate-corrected) of inter-individual 
variability in cognitive deterioration, via an axis primarily affecting 
executive function. Notably, based on their contribution to the clinical 
severity in Alzheimer's disease, we found significant functional alterations to 
glutamatergic interactions affecting tau accumulation and neural activity 
dysfunction and GABAergic interactions concurrently affecting neural activity 
dysfunction, amyloid and tau distributions, as well as significant cholinergic 
receptor effects on tau accumulation. Overall, GABAergic alterations had the 
largest effect on cognitive impairment (particularly executive function) in our 
Alzheimer's disease cohort (n = 25). Furthermore, we demonstrate the clinical 
applicability of this approach by characterizing subjects based on 
individualized 'fingerprints' of receptor alterations. This study introduces the 
first robust, data-driven framework for integrating several neurotransmitter 
receptors, multimodal neuroimaging and clinical data in a flexible and 
interpretable brain model. It enables further understanding of the mechanistic 
neuropathological basis of neurodegenerative progression and heterogeneity, and 
constitutes a promising step towards implementing personalized, 
neurotransmitter-based treatments.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the heterogeneous etiology of suspected 
non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology (SNAP), a group of subjects with 
neurodegeneration in the absence of β-amyloid. Using antemortem MRI and 
pathological data, we investigated the etiology of SNAP and the association of 
neurodegenerative pathologies with structural medial temporal lobe (MTL) 
measures in β-amyloid-negative subjects.
METHODS: Subjects with antemortem MRI and autopsy data were selected from ADNI 
(n=63) and the University of Pennsylvania (n=156). Pathological diagnoses and 
semi-quantitative scores of MTL tau, neuritic plaques, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 
pathology and MTL structural MRI measures from antemortem T1-weighted MRI scans 
were obtained. β-amyloid status (A+/A-) was determined by CERAD score and 
neurodegeneration status (N+/N-) by hippocampal volume.
RESULTS: SNAP reflects a heterogeneous group of pathological diagnoses. In ADNI, 
SNAP (A-N+) had significantly more neuropathological diagnoses than A+N+. In the 
A- group, tau pathology was associated with hippocampal, entorhinal cortex, and 
Brodmann area 35 volume/thickness and TDP-43 pathology with hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSION: SNAP had a heterogeneous profile with more mixed pathologies than 
A+N+. Moreover, a role for TDP-43 and tau pathology in driving MTL 
neurodegeneration in the absence of β-amyloid was supported.

The advent of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has revolutionized the 
way human experts, especially from non-computational domains, approach 
artificial intelligence; this is particularly true for clinical applications 
where the transparency of the results is often compromised by the algorithmic 
complexity. Here, we investigate how Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects brain 
connectivity within a cohort of 432 subjects whose T1 brain Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging data (MRI) were acquired within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). In particular, the cohort included 92 patients with AD, 126 
normal controls (NC) and 214 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We 
show how graph theory-based models can accurately distinguish these clinical 
conditions and how Shapley values, borrowed from game theory, can be adopted to 
make these models intelligible and easy to interpret. Explainability analyses 
outline the role played by regions like putamen, middle and superior temporal 
gyrus; from a class-related perspective, it is possible to outline specific 
regions, such as hippocampus and amygdala for AD and posterior cingulate and 
precuneus for MCI. The approach is general and could be adopted to outline how 
brain connectivity affects specific brain regions.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has 
continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and 
has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified 
researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data 
during 2014 and 2015.
METHODS: We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data.
RESULTS: (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to 
hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and 
disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects 
before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal β-amyloid deposition 
(Aβ+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade 
hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than Aβ 
deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with Aβ to increase 
white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of 
atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may 
underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network 
connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of 
Aβ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical Aβ deposition 
and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci 
have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively 
normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and 
include groups typified not only by "classic" AD pathology but also by normal 
biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) 
Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more 
pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive 
outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate 
outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may 
further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine 
learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and 
prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) 
Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal 
classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling 
multimodal classifiers.
DISCUSSION: Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding 
of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and 
improves clinical trial design.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting nearly 6.5 million people, is the fifth 
leading cause of death in individuals 65 years or older in the USA. Prior 
research has shown that AD disproportionality affects females; females have a 
greater incidence rate, perform worse on a variety of neuropsychological tasks, 
and have greater total brain atrophy. Recent research has linked these sex 
differences to neuroimaging markers of brain pathology, such as hippocampal 
volumes. Specifically, research from our lab found that functional connectivity 
from the hippocampus to the precuneus cortex and brain stem was significantly 
stronger in males than in females with mild cognitive impairment. The aim of 
this study was to extend our understanding to individuals with AD and to 
determine if these potential sex-specific functional connectivity biomarkers 
extend through different disease stages. The resting state fMRI and T2 MRI of 
cognitively normal individuals (n = 32, female = 16) and individuals with AD 
(n = 32, female = 16) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were analyzed using the Functional Connectivity Toolbox (CONN). Our 
results demonstrate that males had a significantly stronger interhemispheric 
functional connectivity between the left and right hippocampus compared to 
females. These results improve our current understanding of the role of the 
hippocampus in sex differences in AD. Understanding the contribution of impaired 
functional connectivity sex differences may aid in the development of 
sex-specific precision medicine for improved AD treatment.

We investigated differences due to sex in brain structural volume and cortical 
thickness in older cognitively normal (N=742), cognitively impaired (MCI; N=540) 
and Alzheimer's Dementia (AD; N=402) individuals from the ADNI and AIBL datasets 
(861 Males and 823 Females). General linear models were used to control the 
effect of relevant covariates including age, intracranial volume, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scanner field strength and scanner types. Significant 
volumetric differences due to sex were observed within different cortical and 
subcortical regions of the cognitively normal group. The number of significantly 
different regions was reduced in the MCI group, and no region remained different 
in the AD group. Cortical thickness was overall thinner in males than females in 
the cognitively normal group, and likewise, the differences due to sex were 
reduced in the MCI and AD groups. These findings were sustained after including 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau and phosphorylated tau (pTau) as additional 
covariates.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) frequently occur in Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) and have a contribution from ischemia, though their relationship with 
β-amyloid and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) is not completely understood. 
We used AT classification to categorize individuals based on their β-amyloid and 
tau pathologies, then assessed the effects of β-amyloid and tau on WMH volume 
and number. We then determined regions in which β-amyloid and WMH accumulation 
were related. Last, we analyzed the effects of various CVRFs on WMHs. As 
secondary analyses, we observed effects of age and sex differences, atrophy, 
cognitive scores, and APOE genotype. PET, MRI, FLAIR, demographic, and 
cardiovascular health data was collected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) (N = 287, 48 % male). Participants were 
categorized as A + and T + if their Florbetapir SUVR and Flortaucipir SUVR were 
above 0.79 and 1.25, respectively. WMHs were mapped on MRI using a deep 
convolutional neural network (Sepehrband et al., 2020). CVRF scores were based 
on history of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, 
respiration rate, BMI, and a cumulative score with 6 being the maximum score. 
Regression models and Pearson correlations were used to test associations and 
correlations between variables, respectively, with age, sex, years of education, 
and scanner manufacturer as covariates of no interest. WMH volume percent was 
significantly associated with global β-amyloid (r = 0.28, p < 0.001), but not 
tau (r = 0.05, p = 0.25). WMH volume percent was higher in individuals with 
either A + or T + pathology compared to controls, particularly within in the 
A+/T + group (p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.4, t = -2.5). Individual CVRFs nor 
cumulative CVRF scores were associated with increased WMH volume. Finally, the 
regions where β-amyloid and WMH count were most positively associated were the 
middle temporal region in the right hemisphere (r = 0.18, p = 0.002) and the 
fusiform region in the left hemisphere (r = 0.017, p = 0.005). β-amyloid and WMH 
have a clear association, though the mechanism facilitating this association is 
still not fully understood. The associations found between β-amyloid and WMH 
burden emphasizes the relationship between β-amyloid and vascular lesion 
formation while factors like CVRFs, age, and sex affect AD development through 
various mechanisms. These findings highlight potential causes and mechanisms of 
AD as targets for future preventions and treatments. Going forward, a larger 
emphasis may be placed on β-amyloid's vascular effects and the implications of 
impaired brain clearance in AD.

Machine learning methods have been widely used for early diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) via functional connectivity networks (FCNs) analysis 
from neuroimaging data. The conventional low-order FCNs are obtained by 
time-series correlation of the whole brain based on resting-state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). However, FCNs overlook inter-region 
interactions, which limits application to brain disease diagnosis. To overcome 
this drawback, we develop a novel framework to exploit the high-level dynamic 
interactions among brain regions for early AD diagnosis. Specifically, a sliding 
window approach is employed to generate some R-fMRI sub-series. The correlations 
among these sub-series are then used to construct a series of dynamic FCNs. 
High-order FCNs based on the topographical similarity between each pair of the 
dynamic FCNs are then constructed. Afterward, a local weight clustering method 
is used to extract effective features of the network, and the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operation method is chosen for feature selection. A 
support vector machine is employed for classification, and the dynamic 
high-order network approach is evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the 
proposed approach not only achieves promising results for AD classification, but 
also successfully recognizes disease-related biomarkers.

The uncal apex is an anatomical landmark frequently used for segmenting the 
hippocampus into its anterior and posterior segments, a necessary step for 
computing many measurements of its long axis. It functions well, as it is both 
local to the hippocampus and easy to identify. However, in spite of widespread 
use and definition in the EADC-ADNI Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol (HarP), how 
the uncal apex is influenced by gross hippocampal changes during normal aging 
has not been established, nor has the possible impact on measures of anterior 
hippocampus (aHPC) and posterior hippocampus (pHPC) volume. Here I drew upon 
three large data sets to describe and confirm these relationships, investigating 
them in one large data set and replicating my findings in the two others, 
evaluating a total of 4,434 hippocampi. I found the uncal apex fell in an 
increasingly more anterior position with increasing age. This age-related 
retraction of the uncus began after age 36, with the sharpest effects arising 
after age 60. This phenomenon exaggerates age-related aHPC volume decreases 
while simultaneously underestimating age-related pHPC volume decreases, a 
pattern I confirmed by juxtaposing uncal apex and MNI space-based landmarking. A 
hippocampally based reference frame was also rendered unstable by age-related 
shifts in the posterior extent of the hippocampus. Both the uncal apex and 
hippocampal reference frame should therefore be used with caution in aging 
research, or in research involving other demographic or disease factors known to 
evoke gross changes in the hippocampus. Instead, MNI coordinate-based heuristics 
may be appropriate for segmenting the hippocampus in study designs involving 
such factors. Apex-based segmentation is still attractive, however, in study 
designs where advanced age and atrophy are not used as regressors, including 
investigations into long-axis effects in healthy young adults. Progress toward 
localizing functional divisions within the hippocampus is needed to identify 
best practices for the field.

OBJECTIVES: The trail making test part B (TMT-B) evaluates executive functions, 
memory, and sensorimotor functions. No previous study was found to examine the 
longitudinal effect of APOE-ε4 genotypes on the TMT-B scores in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) across racial groups.
METHODS: This study used the data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI): 382 participants with AD, 503 with cognitive normal (CN), 
1293 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and follow-up of four 
years. The multivariable linear mixed model was used to investigate the effect 
of APOE-ε4 genotypes on changes in TMT-B scores.
RESULTS: Compared with Whites, African Americans (AA) and Hispanics had higher 
TMT-B scores (poor cognitive function). Furthermore, Whites subjects with 1 or 2 
APOE-ε4 alleles had significantly higher TMT-B scores compared with individuals 
without APOE-ε4 allele at baseline and four follow-up visits; however, no 
differences in TMT-B were found between APOE-ε4 alleles in the Hispanic and AA 
groups. No APOE-ε4 by visit interactions was found for 3 racial groups. 
Stratified by AD diagnosis, the APOE-ε4 allele was associated with TMT-B scores 
only in the MCI group, while there were significant interactions for visit by 
education, APOE-ε4 allele, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in 
the MCI group. In addition, TMT-B was significantly correlated with the MMSE, AD 
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS13), tTau, pTau, Aβ42, and 
hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE-ɛ4 allele is associated with TMT-B scores in Whites subjects, 
but not in the Hispanic and AA groups. APOE-ε4 showed interaction with visit in 
the MCI group.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suffer progressive cerebral atrophy before 
dementia onset. However, the region-specific atrophic processes and the 
influences of age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) on atrophic trajectory are still 
unclear. By mapping the region-specific nonlinear atrophic trajectory of whole 
cerebrum from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to AD based on 
longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging data from Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, we unraveled a quadratic accelerated 
atrophic trajectory of 68 cerebral regions from aMCI to AD, especially in the 
superior temporal pole, caudate, and hippocampus. Besides, interaction analyses 
demonstrated that APOE ε4 carriers had faster atrophic rates than noncarriers in 
8 regions, including the caudate, hippocampus, insula, etc.; younger patients 
progressed faster than older patients in 32 regions, especially for the superior 
temporal pole, hippocampus, and superior temporal gyrus; and 15 regions 
demonstrated complex interaction among age, APOE, and disease progression, 
including the caudate, hippocampus, etc. (P < 0.05/68, Bonferroni correction). 
Finally, Cox proportional hazards regression model based on the identified 
region-specific biomarkers could effectively predict the time to AD conversion 
within 10 years. In summary, cerebral atrophic trajectory mapping could help a 
comprehensive understanding of AD development and offer potential biomarkers for 
predicting AD conversion.

IMPORTANCE: Longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a relevant 
outcome in clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer 
disease (AD). A key unanswered question is whether the use of 
participant-specific (individualized) regions of interest (ROIs) is superior to 
conventional approaches where the same ROI (group-level) is used for each 
participant.
OBJECTIVE: To compare group- and participant-level ROIs in participants at 
different stages of the AD clinical continuum in terms of annual percentage 
change in tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and sample size 
requirements.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a longitudinal cohort study with 
consecutive participant enrollment between September 18, 2017, and November 15, 
2021. Included in the analysis were participants with mild cognitive impairment 
and AD dementia from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish Biomarkers For 
Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably 2 (BioFINDER-2) 
study; in addition, a validation sample (the AVID 05e, Expedition-3, Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], and BioFINDER-1 study cohorts) was also 
included.
EXPOSURES: Tau PET (BioFINDER-2, [18F]RO948; validation sample, 
[18F]flortaucipir), 7 group-level (5 data-driven stages, meta-temporal, whole 
brain), and 5 individualized ROIs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual percentage change in tau-PET SUVR across 
ROIs. Sample size requirements in simulated clinical trials using tau PET as an 
outcome were also calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 215 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.4 (7.5) years; 111 male 
[51.6%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study were included in this analysis: 97 amyloid-β 
(Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 77 with Aβ-positive mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 41 with AD dementia. In the validation sample 
were 137 Aβ-positive CU participants, 144 with Aβ-positive MCI, and 125 with AD 
dementia. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.8 (0.3) years. Using group-level ROIs, 
the largest annual percentage increase in tau-PET SUVR in Aβ-positive CU 
individuals was seen in a composite ROI combining the entorhinal cortex, 
hippocampus, and amygdala (4.29%; 95% CI, 3.42%-5.16%). In individuals with 
Aβ-positive MCI, the greatest change was seen in the temporal cortical regions 
(5.82%; 95% CI, 4.67%-6.97%), whereas in those with AD dementia, the greatest 
change was seen in the parietal regions (5.22%; 95% CI, 3.95%-6.49%). 
Significantly higher estimates of annual percentage change were found using 
several of the participant-specific ROIs. Importantly, the simplest 
participant-specific approach, where change in tau PET was calculated in an ROI 
that best matched the participant's data-driven disease stage, performed best in 
all 3 subgroups. For the power analysis, sample size reductions for the 
participant-specific ROIs ranged from 15.94% (95% CI, 8.14%-23.74%) to 72.10% 
(95% CI, 67.10%-77.20%) compared with the best-performing group-level ROIs. 
Findings were replicated using [18F]flortaucipir.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Finding suggest that certain individualized ROIs 
carry an advantage over group-level ROIs for assessing longitudinal tau changes 
and increase the power to detect treatment effects in AD clinical trials using 
longitudinal tau PET as an outcome.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are often present in individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. NPS are 
associated with structural and functional changes in the brain such as atrophy, 
regional hypometabolism, and hypoperfusion, considered proxies of 
neurodegeneration. Our objective was to evaluate the association between NPS and 
regional cerebral tau burden, a more direct representation of neurodegeneration, 
in cognitively normal (CN), MCI, and AD dementia individuals.
METHODS: Cross-sectional NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI) in 410 CN, 199 MCI, and 61 AD dementia participants who underwent 
flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography as part of the AD Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Total NPI score and two factors of NPS (affective and 
hyperactive) were used in analyses. Linear regression models with backward 
elimination were employed with NPI as dependent variable and regional tau or 
tau-amyloid interaction as predictor of interest. Covariates included education, 
age, sex, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Total Learning, and Trail Making 
Test B.
RESULTS: There were significant associations (p < 0.05) between the NPI 
variables (total score, Affective factor) and entorhinal and precuneus tau 
across all participants. These associations were also significant for the 
tau-amyloid interaction. These effects were significant in cognitively 
symptomatic participants (MCI and AD dementia), but not in CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased tau burden in the entorhinal and precuneus cortices was 
modestly associated with greater NPS in MCI and AD dementia. Further evaluation 
of NPS and their effect on early-stage AD could aid in finding new interventions 
and slowing disease progression.

OBJECTIVE: Brain reserve, cognitive reserve, and education are thought to 
protect against late-life cognitive decline, but these variables have not been 
directly compared to one another in the same model, using future cognitive and 
functional decline as outcomes. We sought to determine whether the influence of 
these protective factors on executive function (EF) and daily function decline 
was dependent upon Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology severity, as measured by 
the total tau to beta-amyloid (T-τ/Aβ1-42) ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
METHOD: Participants were 1201 older adult volunteers in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Brain reserve was defined using a 
composite index of structural brain volumes (total brain matter, hippocampus, 
and white matter hyperintensity). Cognitive reserve was defined as the variance 
in episodic memory performance not explained by brain integrity and 
demographics.
RESULTS: At higher levels of T-τ/Aβ1-42, brain and cognitive reserve predicted 
slower decline in EF. Only brain reserve attenuated decline at lower levels of 
T-τ/Aβ1-42. Education had no independent association with cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: These results point to a hierarchy of protection against aging- and 
disease-associated cognitive decline. When pathology is low, only structural 
brain integrity predicts rate of future EF decline. The ability of cognitive 
reserve to predict future EF decline becomes stronger as CSF biomarker evidence 
of AD increases. Although education is typically thought of as a proxy for 
cognitive reserve, it did not show any protective effects on cognition after 
accounting for brain integrity and the residual cognitive reserve index.

INTRODUCTION: Lumbar puncture (LP) to collect and examine cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) is an important option for the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarkers but it is not routinely performed due to its invasiveness and link to 
adverse effects (AE).
METHODS: We include all participants who received at least one LP in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Study. For comparison between 
groups, two-sample t-tests for continuous, and Pearson's chi-square test for 
categorical variables were performed.
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-seven LP-related AEs were reported by 172 
participants after 1702 LPs (13.3%). The mean age of participants who reported 
at least one AE was 69.79 (standard deviation (SD) 6.3) versus none 72.44 (7.17) 
years (p < 0.001) with female predominance (115/172 = 67.4% vs 435/913 = 48%), 
and had greater entorhinal cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (3.903 
(0.782) vs 3.684 (0.775) mm, p = 0.002; 7.38 (1.06) vs 7.05 (1.15) mm3, 
p < 0.001), respectively.
DISCUSSION: We found that younger age, female sex, and greater thickness of the 
entorhinal cortex were associated with a higher rate of LP-related AE reports.

The path signature is a means of feature generation that can encode nonlinear 
interactions in data in addition to the usual linear terms. It provides 
interpretable features and its output is a fixed length vector irrespective of 
the number of input points or their sample times. In this paper we use the path 
signature to provide features for identifying people whose diagnosis 
subsequently converts to Alzheimer's disease. In two separate classification 
tasks we distinguish converters from 1) healthy individuals, and 2) individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment. The data used are time-ordered measurements of 
the whole brain, ventricles and hippocampus from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We find two nonlinear interactions which are 
predictive in both cases. The first interaction is change of hippocampal volume 
with time, and the second is a change of hippocampal volume relative to the 
volume of the whole brain. While hippocampal and brain volume changes are well 
known in Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrate the power of the path signature in 
their identification and analysis without manual feature selection. Sequential 
data is becoming increasingly available as monitoring technology is applied, and 
the path signature method is shown to be a useful tool in the processing of this 
data.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive form of dementia that results in problems 
with memory, thinking, and behavior. It often starts with abnormal aggregation 
and deposition of β amyloid and tau, followed by neuronal damage such as atrophy 
of the hippocampi, leading to Alzheimers Disease (AD). The aim of this paper is 
to map the genetic-imaging-clinical pathway for AD in order to delineate the 
genetically-regulated brain changes that drive disease progression based on the 
Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We develop a novel 
two-step approach to delineate the association between high-dimensional 2D 
hippocampal surface exposures and the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) 
cognitive score, while taking into account the ultra-high dimensional clinical 
and genetic covariates at baseline. Analysis results suggest that the radial 
distance of each pixel of both hippocampi is negatively associated with the 
severity of behavioral deficits conditional on observed clinical and genetic 
covariates. These associations are stronger in Cornu Ammonis region 1 (CA1) and 
subiculum subregions compared to Cornu Ammonis region 2 (CA2) and Cornu Ammonis 
region 3 (CA3) subregions. Supplementary materials for this article, including a 
standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work,

BACKGROUND: Glymphatic dysfunction may contribute to the accumulation of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies. Conversely, AD pathologic change might 
also cause neuroinflammation and aggravate glymphatic dysfunction, forming a 
loop that accelerates AD progression. In vivo validations are needed to confirm 
their relationships.
METHODS: In this study, we included 144 cognitively normal participants with AD 
pathological biomarker data (baseline CSF Aβ1-42, T-Tau, P-Tau181; plasma 
P-Tau181 at baseline and at least one follow-up) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Each subject had completed structural 
MRI scans. Among them, 117 subjects have available neuroinflammatory biomarker 
(soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and 123 
subjects have completed two times [18F]-florbetapir PET. The enlarged PVS (EPVS) 
visual rating scores in basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CS) were 
assessed on T1-weighted images to reflect glymphatic dysfunction. Intracranial 
volume and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume were also calculated for 
further analysis. We performed stepwise linear regression models and mediation 
analyses to estimate the association between EPVS severity, sTREM2, and AD 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: CS-EPVS degree was associated with CSF sTREM2, annual change of plasma 
P-tau181 and total WMH volume, whereas BG-EPVS severity was associated with age, 
gender and intracranial volume. The sTREM2 mediated the association between CSF 
P-tau181 and CS-EPVS.
CONCLUSION: Impaired glymphatic dysfunction could contribute to the accumulation 
of pathological tau protein. The association between tauopathy and glymphatic 
dysfunction was mediated by the microglia inflammatory process. These findings 
may provide evidence for novel treatment strategies of anti-neuroinflammation 
therapy in the early stage.

This study employed a deep learning longitudinal model, graph convolutional and 
recurrent neural network (graph-CNN-RNN), on a series of brain structural MRI 
scans for AD prognosis. It characterized whole-brain morphology via 
incorporating longitudinal cortical and subcortical morphology and defined a 
probabilistic risk for the prediction of AD as a function of age prior to 
clinical diagnosis. The graph-CNN-RNN model was trained on half of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset (ADNI, n = 1559) and 
validated on the other half of the ADNI dataset and the Open Access Series of 
Imaging Studies-3 (OASIS-3, n = 930). Our findings demonstrated that the 
graph-CNN-RNN can reliably and robustly diagnose AD at the accuracy rate of 85% 
and above across all the time points for both datasets. The graph-CNN-RNN 
predicted the AD conversion from 0 to 4 years before the AD onset at ∼80% of 
accuracy. The AD probabilistic risk was associated with clinical traits, 
cognition, and amyloid burden assessed using [18F]-Florbetapir (AV45) positron 
emission tomography (PET) across all the time points. The graph-CNN-RNN provided 
the quantitative trajectory of brain morphology from prognosis to overt stages 
of AD. Such a deep learning tool and the AD probabilistic risk have great 
potential in clinical applications for AD prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal tau quantification may provide a useful marker of drug 
efficacy in clinical trials. Different tau PET tracers may have different 
sensitivity to longitudinal changes, but without a head-to-head dataset or a 
carefully designed case-matching procedure, comparing results in different 
cohorts can be biased. In this study, we compared the tau PET tracers, 
18F-MK6240 and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP), both cross-sectionally and longitudinally 
by case-matching subjects in the AIBL and ADNI longitudinal cohort studies.
METHODS: A subset of 113 participants from AIBL and 113 from ADNI imaged using 
18F-MK6240 and 18F-FTP respectively, with baseline and follow-up, were matched 
based on baseline clinical diagnosis, MMSE, age and amyloid (Aβ) PET centiloid 
value. Subjects were grouped as 64 Aβ- cognitively unimpaired (CU), 22 Aβ+ CU, 
14 Aβ+ mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 13 Aβ+ Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Tracer retention was measured in the mesial, temporoparietal, rest of the 
cortex, and a meta-temporal region composed of entorhinal, inferior/middle 
temporal, fusiform, parahippocampus and amygdala. T-tests were employed to 
assess group separation at baseline using SUVR Z-scores and longitudinally using 
SUVR%/Yr.
RESULTS: Both tracers detected statistically significant differences at baseline 
in most regions between all clinical groups. Only 18F-MK6240 showed 
statistically significant higher rate of SUVR increase in Aβ+ CU compared to Aβ- 
CU in the mesial, meta-temporal and temporoparietal regions.
CONCLUSION: 18F-MK6240 appears to be a more sensitive tracer for change in tau 
level at the preclinical stage of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and associations of MRI-visible 
perivascular spaces (PVS) with clinical progression and longitudinal cognitive 
decline across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.
METHODS: We included 1429 participants (641 [44.86%] female) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. PVS number and 
grade in the centrum semiovale (CSO-PVS), basal ganglia (BG-PVS), and 
hippocampus (HP-PVS) were compared among the control (CN), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. PVS were tested as 
predictors of diagnostic progression (i.e., CN to MCI/AD or MCI to AD) and 
longitudinal changes in the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog 13), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
memory (ADNI-MEM), and executive function (ADNI-EF) using multiple linear 
regression, linear mixed-effects, and Cox proportional hazards modeling.
RESULTS: Compared with CN subjects, MCI and AD subjects had more CSO-PVS, both 
in number (p < 0.001) and grade (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant 
difference in BG-PVS and HP-PVS across the AD spectrum (p > 0.05). Individuals 
with moderate and frequent/severe CSO-PVS had a higher diagnostic conversion 
risk than individuals with no/mild CSO-PVS (log-rank p < 0.001 for all) in the 
combined CN and MCI group. Further Cox regression analyses revealed that 
moderate and frequent/severe CSO-PVS were associated with a higher risk of 
diagnostic conversion (HR = 2.007, 95% CI = 1.382-2.914, p < 0.001; HR = 2.676, 
95% CI = 1.830-3.911, p < 0.001, respectively). A higher CSO-PVS number was 
associated with baseline cognitive performance and longitudinal cognitive 
decline in all cognitive tests (p < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: CSO-PVS were more common in MCI and AD and were associated with 
cognitive decline across the AD spectrum.

End-stage kidney disease has been associated with cognitive impairment and brain 
atrophy. It remains unclear if mild to moderate kidney dysfunction is associated 
with brain atrophy, especially in older adults. We used cross-sectional data 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), an NIH-funded 
multicenter longitudinal cohort study, to better understand the association 
between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and brain volumes. We 
included all ADNI participants with both baseline serum creatinine values and 
MRI brain volume assessments. We used multiple linear regression modeling to 
assess cross-sectional associations between eGFR and whole-brain gray matter, 
hippocampus, entorhinal, fusiform, and middle temporal brain volumes. 
Participants (n = 1,596) were 74 ± 7 years old with a mean eGFR of 69.4 ± 14.8 
mL/min/1.73 m2; 53% had mild cognitive impairment, and 19% had dementia. 
Unadjusted analysis showed an association between lower eGFR and smaller brain 
volumes. After adjusting for age, sex, and education, there was no association 
between eGFR brain volumes (p > 0.05 for all). These results remained consistent 
after subgroup analysis by age stratification and baseline cognitive status. Age 
was a confounding variable in the unadjusted association between the eGFR and 
brain volumes. Thus, a mild to moderately reduced eGFR was not associated with 
brain atrophy in ADNI participants.

The structural covariance network (SCN) has provided a perspective on the 
large-scale brain organization impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
continuum. However, the successive structural impairment across brain regions, 
which may underlie the disrupted SCN in the AD continuum, is not well 
understood. In the current study, we enrolled 446 subjects with AD, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal aging (NA) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The SCN as well as a casual SCN (CaSCN) 
based on Granger causality analysis were applied to the T1-weighted structural 
magnetic resonance images of the subjects. Compared with that of the NAs, the 
SCN was disrupted in the MCI and AD subjects, with the hippocampus and left 
middle temporal lobe being the most impaired nodes, which is in line with 
previous studies. In contrast, according to the 194 subjects with records on CSF 
amyloid and Tau, the CaSCN revealed that during AD progression, the CaSCN was 
enhanced. Specifically, the hippocampus, thalamus, and precuneus/posterior 
cingulate cortex (PCC) were identified as the core regions in which atrophy 
originated and could predict atrophy in other brain regions. Taken together, 
these findings provide a comprehensive view of brain atrophy in the AD continuum 
and the relationships among the brain atrophy in different regions, which may 
provide novel insight into the progression of AD.

T1-weighted structural MRI is widely used to measure brain morphometry (e.g., 
cortical thickness and subcortical volumes). Accelerated scans as fast as one 
minute or less are now available but it is unclear if they are adequate for 
quantitative morphometry. Here we compared the measurement properties of a 
widely adopted 1.0 mm resolution scan from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI = 5'12'') with two variants of highly accelerated 1.0 mm scans 
(compressed-sensing, CSx6 = 1'12''; and wave-controlled aliasing in parallel 
imaging, WAVEx9 = 1'09'') in a test-retest study of 37 older adults aged 54 to 
86 (including 19 individuals diagnosed with a neurodegenerative dementia). Rapid 
scans produced highly reliable morphometric measures that largely matched the 
quality of morphometrics derived from the ADNI scan. Regions of lower 
reliability and relative divergence between ADNI and rapid scan alternatives 
tended to occur in midline regions and regions with susceptibility-induced 
artifacts. Critically, the rapid scans yielded morphometric measures similar to 
the ADNI scan in regions of high atrophy. The results converge to suggest that, 
for many current uses, extremely rapid scans can replace longer scans. As a 
final test, we explored the possibility of a 0'49'' 1.2 mm CSx6 structural scan, 
which also showed promise. Rapid structural scans may benefit MRI studies by 
shortening the scan session and reducing cost, minimizing opportunity for 
movement, creating room for additional scan sequences, and allowing for the 
repetition of structural scans to increase precision of the estimates.

BACKGROUND: Cases with the limbic-predominant age-related TAR DNA-binding 
protein 43 (TDP-43) encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and mixed AD+TDP-43 pathology (AD+LATE-NC) share similar symptoms, 
which makes it a challenge for accurate diagnosis. Exploring the patterns of 
gray matter structural covariance networks (SCNs) in these three types may help 
to clarify the underlying mechanism and provide a basis for clinical 
interventions.
METHODS: We included ante-mortem MRI data of 10 LATE-NC, 39  AD, and 25  
AD+LATE-NC from the ADNI autopsy sample. We used four regions of interest (left 
posterior cingulate cortex, right entorhinal cortex, frontoinsular and 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) to anchor the default mode network (DMN), 
salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN). Finally, we assessed 
the SCN alternations using a multi-regression model-based linear-interaction 
analysis.
RESULTS: Cases with autopsy-confirmed LATE-NC and AD showed increased structural 
associations involving DMN, ECN, and SN. Cases with AD+LATE-NC showed increased 
structural association within DMN while decreased structural association between 
DMN and ECN. The volume of peak clusters showed significant associations with 
cognition and AD pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed different SCN patterns in the cases with LATE-NC, 
AD, and AD+LATE-NC, and indicated the network disconnection mechanism underlying 
these three neuropathological progressions. Further, SCN may serve as an 
effective biomarker to distinguish between different types of dementia.

Longitudinal MRI is used in clinical research studies to examine illness 
progression, neurodevelopment, and the effect of medical interventions. Such 
studies typically report changes in brain volume of less than 5%. However, there 
is a concern that these findings could be obscured or confounded by small 
changes in brain volume estimates caused by physiological factors such as, 
dehydration, blood pressure, caffeine levels, and circadian rhythm. In this 
study, MRI scans using the ADNI-III protocol were acquired from 20 
participants (11 female) at two time points (mean interval = 20.3 days). 
Hydration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, caffeine intake, and time of 
day were recorded at both visits. Images were processed using FreeSurfer. 
Three a priori hypothesised brain regions (hippocampus, lateral ventricles, and 
total brain) were selected, and an exploratory analysis was conducted on 
FreeSurfer's auto-segmented brain regions. There was no significant effect of 
the physiological factors on changes in the hypothesised brain regions. We 
provide estimates for the maximum percentage change in regional brain volumes 
that could be expected to occur from normal variation in each of the 
physiological measures. In this study, normal variations in physiological 
parameters did not have a detectable effect on longitudinal changes in brain 
volume.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor for 
brain atrophy and glucose hypometabolism in older adults with or at risk of 
cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Participants with the T2DM were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1/GO/2 cohorts). Analysis of covariance models 
were used to compare participants with and without T2DM, controlling for 
potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: Whole brain volume and whole brain [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
uptake were significantly different as a function of T2DM status, independent of 
baseline clinical diagnosis. On post hoc analysis, a lower whole brain volume 
was seen in participants with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and T2DM (n = 
76) compared with participants who had MCI but not T2DM (n = 747; p = 0.009). 
Similarly, mean FDG uptake in gray matter and white matter was lower in 
participants with both MCI and T2DM (n = 72) than in participants with MCI 
without T2DM (n = 719; p = 0.04). Subsequent regional analysis revealed that the 
decreased FDG uptake in participants with both MCI and T2DM was mainly 
manifested in 3 brain regions: frontal lobe, sensory motor cortex, and striatum.
CONCLUSIONS: T2DM may accelerate cognition deterioration in patients with MCI by 
affecting glucose metabolism and brain volume.

AIM: We determined if differences in renal function, even within normal levels, 
influenced hippocampal volume (HCV) and cognition.
METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects 
with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were selected from the ADNI database (N = 1,269) 
and divided into three groups (eGFR 60-75, 75-90 and ≥90). Associations between 
eGFR, HCV and cognition scores were examined using regression methods, and 
random-coefficient models. The relationship between various factors, such as 
vascular burden and brain amyloid deposition, were investigated using path 
analysis.
RESULTS: Higher eGFR was associated with larger HCVs and better cognition in all 
subjects at baseline. In MCI subjects, hippocampal atrophy in the eGFR ≥ 90 
group progressed at just half the rate of the eGFR 75-90 group (P = .006), and 
was also somewhat slower than the eGFR 60-75 group (P = .08). A comprehensive 
path model linking eGFR, HCV and cognition, and integrating vascular burden and 
amyloid deposition, is proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher renal function was associated with slower hippocampal 
atrophy and cognitive decline even within normal levels of renal function. This 
relationship was mediated mainly through cardiovascular risk burden and amyloid 
deposition. Further studies examining neuroinflammation are needed. Geriatr

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To develop and validate a deep learning-based automatic 
segmentation model for assessing intracranial volume (ICV) and to compare the 
accuracy determined by NeuroQuant (NQ), FreeSurfer (FS), and SynthSeg.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 60 subjects [30 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), 21 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 9 cognitively 
normal (CN)] from a single tertiary hospital for the training and validation 
group (50:10). The test group included 40 subjects (20 AD, 10 MCI, 10 CN) from 
the ADNI dataset. We propose a robust ICV segmentation model based on the 
foundational 2D UNet architecture trained with four types of input images (both 
single and multimodality using scaled or unscaled T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR MR 
images). To compare with our model, NQ, FS, and SynthSeg were also utilized in 
the test group. We evaluated the model performance by measuring the Dice 
similarity coefficient (DSC) and average volume difference.
RESULTS: The single-modality model trained with scaled T1-weighted images showed 
excellent performance with a DSC of 0.989 ± 0.002 and an average volume 
difference of 0.46% ± 0.38%. Our multimodality model trained with both unscaled 
T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images showed similar performance with a DSC of 
0.988 ± 0.002 and an average volume difference of 0.47% ± 0.35%. The overall 
average volume difference with our model showed relatively higher accuracy than 
NQ (2.15% ± 1.72%), FS (3.69% ± 2.93%), and SynthSeg (1.88% ± 1.18%). 
Furthermore, our model outperformed the three others in each subgroup of 
patients with AD, MCI, and CN subjects.
CONCLUSION: Our deep learning-based automatic ICV segmentation model showed 
excellent performance for the automatic evaluation of ICV.

Relationship between serum calcium and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. 
The aim of this study is to test whether serum calcium is associated with other 
AD-associated biomarkers and could predict clinical progression in nondemented 
elders. This was a longitudinal population-based study. The sample was derived 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, which 
included 1224 nondemented elders: 413 cognitively normal (CN) and 811 mild 
cognition impairment (MCI). Associations were investigated between serum calcium 
and longitudinal changes in Aβ/tau pathologic features, brain structure, 
cognitive function, and disease progression. Serum calcium concentrations 
increased with disease severity. Serum calcium predicted longitudinal cognitive 
decline and conversion from nondemented status to AD dementia (adjusted 
HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13-1.76). Furthermore, serum calcium levels were negatively 
correlated with CSF-Aβ42 (β = - 0.558, P = 0.008), FDG-PET (β = - 0.292, 
P < 0.001), whole brain volume (β = - 0.148, P = 0.001), and middle temporal 
volume (β = - 0.216, P = 0.042). Similar results were obtained in CN and MCI 
groups. Higher serum calcium status (even if not hypercalcemia) may increase the 
risk of AD in elders. Serum calcium is a useful biomarker in predicting clinical 
progression in nondemented elders. More researches are needed in the future to 
explore the underlying mechanism.

Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), also known as significant memory 
concern (SMC), has been suggested as a manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
preceding mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study assessed the impact of 
gender on cognition, amyloid accumulation, the volumes of hippocampus, 
entorhinal cortex (EC), fusiform and medial temporal lobe (MTA) and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathology biomarkers in patients reporting SMC. 
Methods: Twenty-nine males (mean age ± SD: 72.3 ± 5.7 years) and 40 females 
(mean age ± SD: 71.0 ± 5.1 years) with SMC from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were included in the study. We explored the gender discrepancies in 
cognition, [18F] AV45 amyloid positivity, volumes of hippocampus, EC, fusiform 
and MTA and CSF biomarkers. Results: Compared with females, males showed 
significantly worse performance in Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 
(ADAS-13; P = 0.004) and lower amyloid deposition (P < 0.001). However, females 
showed greater advantage on the task of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-5 
(RAVLT-5) sum (P = 0.021), RAVLT-immediate recall (P = 0.010) and reduced 
volumes of the hippocampus, EC, fusiform and MTA (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 
0.001, P = 0.007) than males. No gender differences were found in CSF Aβ42, CSF 
Tau and CSF P-tau (P = 0.264, P = 0.454, P = 0.353). Conclusions: These findings 
highlight that gender discrepancies should be considered in the interpretation 
of cognitive measures when evaluating SMC.

BACKGROUND: The association between omega-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and cognition, brain 
imaging and biomarkers is still not fully established.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyze the cross-sectional and retrospective 
longitudinal associations between erythrocyte ω-3 index and cognition, brain 
imaging, and biomarkers among older adults.
METHODS: A total of 832 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI-3) 
participants, with a mean (SD) age of 74.0 (7.9) y, 50.8% female, 55.9% 
cognitively normal, 32.7% with mild cognitive impairment, and 11.4% with 
Alzheimer disease (AD) were included. A low ω-3 index (%EPA + %DHA) was defined 
as the lowest quartile (≤3.70%). Cognitive tests [composite score, AD Assessment 
Scale Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Trail Making Test, 
Category Fluency, Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment] 
and brain variables [hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), 
positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau] were considered as 
outcomes in regression models.
RESULTS: Low ω-3 index was not associated with cognition, hippocampal, and WMH 
volume or brain Aβ and tau after adjustment for demographics, ApoEε4, 
cardiovascular disease, BMI, and total intracranial volume in the 
cross-sectional analysis. In the retrospective analysis, low ω-3 index was 
associated with greater Aβ accumulation (adjusted β = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03; 
P = 0.003). The composite cognitive score did not differ between groups; 
however, low ω-3 index was significantly associated with greater WMS-delayed 
recall cognitive decline (adjusted β = -1.18; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.19; P = 0.019), 
but unexpectedly lower total ADAS-Cog cognitive decline. Low ω-3 index was 
cross-sectionally associated with lower WMS performance (adjusted β = -1.81, 
SE = 0.73, P = 0.014) and higher tau accumulation among ApoE ε4 carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinally, low ω-3 index was associated with greater Aβ 
accumulation and WMS cognitive decline but unexpectedly with lower total 
ADAS-Cog cognitive decline. Although no associations were cross-sectionally 
found in the whole population, low ω-3 index was associated with lower WMS 
cognition and higher tau accumulation among ApoE ε4 carriers. The Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as 
NCT00106899.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding relationships among blood pressure (BP), cognition, 
and brain volume could inform Alzheimer's disease (AD) management.
METHODS: We investigated Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
participants: 200 controls, 346 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 154 AD. 
National Alzheimer's Co-ordinating Center (NACC) participants were separately 
analyzed: 1098 controls, 2297 MCI, and 4845 AD. Relationships between cognition 
and BP were assessed in both cohorts and BP and atrophy rates in ADNI. 
Multivariate mixed linear-regression models were fitted with joint outcomes of 
BP (systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure), cognition (Mini-Mental State 
Examination, Logical Memory, and Digit Symbol) and atrophy rate (whole-brain, 
hippocampus).
RESULTS: ADNI MCI and AD patients with greater baseline systolic BP had higher 
hippocampal atrophy rates ([r, P value]; 0.2, 0.005 and 0.2, 0.04, 
respectively). NACC AD patients with lower systolic BP had lower cognitive 
scores (0.1, 0.0003).
DISCUSSION: Higher late-life BP may be associated with faster decline in 
cognitively impaired elders.

Based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multiple variations ranging 
from MRI scanners to center-specific parameter settings, imaging protocols, and 
brain region-of-interest (ROI) definitions pose a big challenge for multi-center 
Alzheimer's disease characterization and classification. Existing approaches to 
reduce such variations require intricate multi-step, often manual preprocessing 
pipelines, including skull stripping, segmentation, registration, cortical 
reconstruction, and ROI outlining. Such procedures are time-consuming, and more 
importantly, tend to be user biased. Contrasting costly and biased preprocessing 
pipelines, the question arises whether we can design a deep learning model to 
automatically reduce these variations from multiple centers for Alzheimer's 
disease classification? In this study, we used T1 and T2-weighted structural MRI 
from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset based on three 
groups with 375 subjects, respectively: patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC); to 
test our approach, we defined AD classification as classifying an individual's 
structural image to one of the three group labels. We first introduced a 
convolutional adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) to reduce the variations existing 
in multi-center raw MRI scans by automatically registering them into a common 
aligned space. Afterward, a convolutional residual soft attention network (CRAT) 
was further proposed for AD classification. Canonical classification procedures 
demonstrated that our model achieved classification accuracies of 91.8%, 90.05%, 
and 88.10% for the 2-way classification tasks using the RAW aligned MRI scans, 
including AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. HC, respectively. Thus, our 
automated approach achieves comparable or even better classification performance 
by comparing it with many baselines with dedicated conventional preprocessing 
pipelines. Furthermore, the uncovered brain hotpots, i.e., hippocampus, 
amygdala, and temporal pole, are consistent with previous studies.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and impairment in 
various domains. Recent AD studies, (ie, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) study), collect multimodal data, including longitudinal 
neurological assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, to better 
study the disease progression. Adopting early interventions is essential to slow 
AD progression for subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It is of 
particular interest to develop an AD predictive model that leverages multimodal 
data and provides accurate personalized predictions. In this article, we propose 
a multivariate functional mixed model with MRI data (MFMM-MRI) that 
simultaneously models longitudinal neurological assessments, baseline MRI data, 
and the survival outcome (ie, dementia onset) for subjects with MCI at baseline. 
Two functional forms (the random-effects model and instantaneous model) linking 
the longitudinal and survival process are investigated. We use Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on No-U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) algorithm to obtain 
posterior samples. We develop a dynamic prediction framework that provides 
accurate personalized predictions of longitudinal trajectories and survival 
probability. We apply MFMM-MRI to the ADNI study and identify significant 
associations among longitudinal outcomes, MRI data, and the risk of dementia 
onset. The instantaneous model with voxels from the whole brain has the best 
prediction performance among all candidate models. The simulation study supports 
the validity of the estimation and dynamic prediction method.

Background: Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and early-onset Alzheimer's 
disease (EOAD) are different subtypes of AD. This study aimed to build and 
validate radiomics models of the hippocampus for EOAD and young controls (YCs), 
LOAD and old controls (OCs), as well as EOAD and LOAD. Methods: Thirty-six EOAD 
patients, 36 LOAD patients, 36 YCs, and 36 OCs from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were enrolled and allocated to training 
and test sets of the EOAD-YC groups, LOAD-OC groups, and EOAD-LOAD groups. 
Independent external validation sets including 15 EOAD patients, 15 LOAD 
patients, 15 YCs, and 15 OCs from Shanghai Mental Health Center were 
constructed, respectively. Bilateral hippocampal segmentation and feature 
extraction were performed for each subject, and the least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select radiomic features. Support 
vector machine (SVM) models were constructed based on the identified features to 
distinguish EOAD from YC subjects, LOAD from OC subjects, and EOAD from LOAD 
subjects. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) 
were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results: Three, three, and 
four features were selected for EOAD and YC subjects, LOAD and OC subjects, and 
EOAD and LOAD subjects, respectively. The AUC and accuracy of the SVM model were 
0.90 and 0.77 in the test set and 0.91 and 0.87 in the validation set for EOAD 
and YC subjects, respectively; for LOAD and OC subjects, the AUC and accuracy 
were 0.94 and 0.86 in the test set and 0.92 and 0.78 in the validation set, 
respectively. For the SVM model of EOAD and LOAD subjects, the AUC was 0.87 and 
the accuracy was 0.79 in the test set; additionally, the AUC was 0.86 and the 
accuracy was 0.77 in the validation set. Conclusion: The findings of this study 
provide insights into the potential of hippocampal radiomic features as 
biomarkers to diagnose EOAD and LOAD. This study is the first to show that SVM 
classification analysis based on hippocampal radiomic features is a valuable 
method for clinical applications in EOAD.

BACKGROUND: An aging society has increased rates of late onset Alzheimer disease 
dementia (ADD), the most common form of age-related dementia. This 
neurodegenerative disease disproportionately affects women.
METHODS: We use data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
to examine sex differences in cortical thickness (CT) and memory performance. 
Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to examine effects of sex and 
diagnosis (DX) on CT and verbal memory. For regions demonstrating significant 
interaction effects of sex and DX, we tested whether sex moderated 
cognition-thickness relationships. We used machine learning as a complementary 
method to explore multivariate CT differences between women and men.
RESULTS: Women demonstrated greater CT in many brain regions. More specifically, 
men showed relatively consistent CT declines in all stages, from normal control 
(NC) to ADD in the bilateral cingulate cortex, bilateral temporal regions, and 
left precuneus; women had more stable CT in these regions between NC and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) stages, but sharper declines from MCI to ADD. 
Similarly, for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), ANCOVA analyses 
showed that women had significantly better immediate and delayed recall scores 
than men, at NC and MCI stages, but greater differences, cross-sectionally, from 
MCI to ADD than men. We found significant sex moderation effects between 
RAVLT-immediate scores and CT of right isthmus-cingulate for all subjects across 
DX. Partial correlation analyses revealed that increased CT of right 
isthmus-cingulate was associated with better verbal learning in women, driven by 
positron emission tomography defined amyloid positive (Aβ+) subjects. 
Significant sex-moderation effects in cognition-thickness relationships were 
further found in the right middle-temporal, left precuneus, and left superior 
temporal regions in Aβ+ subjects. Using a machine learning approach, we 
investigated multivariate CT differences between women and men, showing an 
accuracy in classification of 75% for Aβ+ cognitively NC participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences in memory and CT can play a key role in the 
different vulnerability and progression of ADD in women compared to men. Machine 
learning indicates sex differences in CT are most relevant early in the ADD 
neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: A decline in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 
correlates with the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and has been associated with frontal and 
parietal hypometabolism, lower cerebrospinal fluid amyloid β1-42, and inferior 
temporal cortical thinning. Identifying the underlying biomarkers of functional 
decline will allow for the early identification of individuals at risk of 
disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between IADL impairment and in vivo 
regional cerebral tau and cortical amyloid deposition across clinically normal 
(CN) elderly, MCI, and AD dementia.
METHODS: Fifty-one CN elderly, 30 MCI, and 9 AD dementia participants of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent assessment of 
regional tau deposition with flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography 
(PET). An aggregate of cortical amyloid burden was assessed by florbetapir PET. 
IADL were assessed using the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Tau 
regions with unadjusted correlations of p ≤ 0.006 (Bonferroni correction) with 
FAQ were used to evaluate the cross-sectional association between FAQ (dependent 
variable) and regional cerebral tau deposition, amyloid burden, and tau-amyloid 
interaction in separate general linear regression models with backward 
elimination. Covariates included age, American National Adult Reading Test 
(AMNART) intelligence quotient (IQ), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) total learning.
RESULTS: Unadjusted correlations between FAQ and tau in the entorhinal cortex 
(EC) and inferior temporal cortex (IT) survived Bonferroni correction. FAQ was 
associated with the tau-amyloid interaction, such that in participants with 
greater amyloid burden, greater IADL impairment was associated with greater 
regional tau (EC tau × amyloid: partial r (pr) = 0.47, p < 0.001; IT tau × 
amyloid: pr = 0.54, p < 0.001). Significant associations were found when these 
regression models were repeated in symptomatic participants alone but not among 
CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater medial and inferior temporal tau and cortical amyloid 
burden were associated with greater IADL impairment in AD. Further elucidation 
of the biomarkers underlying the functional decline will allow for the early 
identification of individual at risk of disease progression.

PURPOSE: Biomarkers used for predicting longitudinal cognitive change in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum are still elusive. Tau pathology, 
neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are the leading candidate predictors. 
We aimed to determine these three aspects of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) and plasma to predict longitudinal cognition status using Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 430 subjects including, 96 cognitive normal 
(CN) with amyloid β (Aβ)-negative, 54 CN with Aβ-positive, 195 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) with Aβ-positive, and 85 AD with amyloid-positive (Aβ-positive 
are identified by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 < 0.138). Aβ burden was evaluated by CSF and 
plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio; tau pathology was evaluated by CSF and plasma 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau181); microglial activation was measured by CSF soluble 
TREM2 (sTREM2) and progranulin (PGRN); neurodegeneration was measured by CSF and 
plasma t-tau and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); cognition was 
examined annually over the subsequent 8 years using the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale Cognition 13-item scale (ADAS13) and Mini-Mental State Exam 
(MMSE). Linear mixed-effects models (LME) were applied to assess the correlation 
between biomarkers and longitudinal cognition decline, as well as their effect 
size on the prediction of longitudinal cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Baseline CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was decreased in MCI and AD compared to 
CN, while CSF p-tau181 and t-tau increased. Baseline CSF sTREM2 and PGRN did not 
show any differences in MCI and AD compared to CN. Baseline brain volumes 
(including the hippocampal, entorhinal, middle temporal lobe, and whole-brain) 
decreased in MCI and AD groups. For the longitudinal study, there were 
significant interaction effects of CSF p-tau181 × time, plasma p-tau181 × time, 
CSF sTREM2 × time, and brain volumes × time, indicating CSF, and plasma 
p-tau181, CSF sTREM2, and brain volumes could predict longitudinal cognition 
deterioration rate. CSF sTREM2, CSF, and plasma p-tau181 had similar medium 
prediction effects, while brain volumes showed stronger effects in predicting 
cognition decline.
CONCLUSION: Our study reported that baseline CSF sTREM2, CSF, and plasma 
p-tau181, as well as structural MRI, could predict longitudinal cognitive 
decline in subjects with positive AD pathology. Plasma p-tau181 can be used as a 
relatively noninvasive reliable biomarker for AD longitudinal cognition decline 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: Radiomics-based morphological brain networks (radMBN) constructed 
from routinely acquired structural MRI (sMRI) data have gained attention in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the radMBN suffers from limited 
characterization of AD because sMRI only characterizes anatomical changes and is 
not a direct measure of neuronal pathology or brain activity.
PURPOSE: To establish a group sparse representation of the radMBN under a joint 
constraint of group-level white matter fiber connectivity and individual-level 
sMRI regional similarity (JCGS-radMBN).
METHODS: Two publicly available datasets were adopted, including 120 subjects 
from ADNI with both T1-weighted image (T1WI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) for 
JCGS-radMBN construction, 818 subjects from ADNI and 200 subjects solely with 
T1WI from AIBL for validation in early AD diagnosis. Specifically, the 
JCGS-radMBN was conducted by jointly estimating non-zero connections among 
subjects, with the regularization term constrained by group-level white matter 
fiber connectivity and individual-level sMRI regional similarity. Then, a 
triplet graph convolutional network was adopted for early AD diagnosis. The 
discriminative brain connections were identified using a two-sample t-test, and 
the neurobiological interpretation was validated by correlating the 
discriminative brain connections with cognitive scores.
RESULTS: The JCGS-radMBN exhibited superior classification performance over five 
brain network construction methods. For the typical NC vs. AD classification, 
the JCGS-radMBN increased by 1-30% in accuracy over the alternatives on ADNI and 
AIBL. The discriminative brain connections exhibited a strong connectivity to 
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and basal ganglia, and had significant 
correlation with MMSE scores.
CONCLUSION: The proposed JCGS-radMBN facilitated the AD characterization of 
brain network established on routinely acquired imaging modality of sMRI.

Hippocampal atrophy is endemic in 'normal aging' but it is unclear what factors 
drive age-related changes in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structural measures. We 
investigated cross-sectional (n = 191) and longitudinal (n = 164) MTL atrophy 
patterns in cognitively normal older adults from ADNI-GO/2 with no to low 
cerebral β-amyloid and assessed whether white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho tau (p-tau) levels can explain age-related 
changes in the MTL. Age was significantly associated with hippocampal volumes 
and Brodmann Area (BA) 35 thickness, regions affected early by neurofibrillary 
tangle pathology, in the cross-sectional analysis and with anterior and/or 
posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and BA35 in the longitudinal analysis. 
CSF p-tau was significantly associated with hippocampal volumes and atrophy 
rates. Mediation analyses showed that CSF p-tau levels partially mediated age 
effects on hippocampal atrophy rates. No significant associations were observed 
for WMHs. These findings point toward a role of tau pathology, potentially 
reflecting Primary Age-Related Tauopathy, in age-related MTL structural changes 
and suggests a potential role for tau-targeted interventions in age-associated 
neurodegeneration and memory decline.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive 
decline and specific brain atrophy patterns, primarily involving the medial 
temporal lobes. A number of studies have discussed hypothalamic involvement in 
AD with consecutive metabolic and/or autonomic disturbances yet only few studies 
have investigated hypothalamic atrophy in AD and its early stages in particular.
METHODS: We applied semi-automated volumetry of the hypothalamus (HTH) in 3 T 
MRI in a sample N = 175 participants [age 74.9 ± 7.22; gender 85 m/90f; 
cognitively normal controls (CN; N = 56); amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI; N = 78); AD (N = 41)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM), cortical thickness 
(CTH) analyses and source-based morphometry (SBM) derived networks of structural 
covariance to investigate brain structural covariance patterns of the HTH under 
consideration of diagnostic groups, β-amyloid (AB) positivity and apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) ε4 status.
RESULTS: Hypothalamic atrophy was observed in both early and advanced disease 
stages (i.e. hypothalamic volume CN > MCI > AD). VBM, CTH analysis and SBM 
revealed positive associations between hypothalamic volume (HV) and 
AD-vulnerable regions, largely corresponding to the Papez circuit and brain 
regions implicated in autonomic regulation, however, group differences regarding 
HTH structural covariance were not observed. Similar observations were made in 
carriers and non-carriers of the ε4 allele, yet more pronounced in ε4 carriers. 
Although not reaching significance, comparisons of AB positive vs. negative 
subjects indicated stronger HTH atrophy in biomarker positive participants. HV 
was not associated with body mass index or longitudinal weight change.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support early structural changes of the HTH in AD. HV 
covaries with regional volumes of AD-vulnerable regions. This could point to 
secondary atrophy of the HTH following atrophy of the hippocampus and other 
structures of the Papez circuit in AD.

BACKGROUND: It is not clear to which degree limbic TDP-43 pathology associates 
with a cholinergic deficit in the absence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.
OBJECTIVE: Replicate and extend recent evidence on cholinergic basal forebrain 
atrophy in limbic TDP-43 and evaluate MRI based patterns of atrophy as a 
surrogate marker for TDP-43.
METHODS: We studied ante-mortem MRI data of 11 autopsy cases with limbic TDP-43 
pathology, 47 cases with AD pathology, and 26 mixed AD/TDP-43 cases from the 
ADNI autopsy sample, and 17 TDP-43, 170 AD, and 58 mixed AD/TDP-43 cases from 
the NACC autopsy sample. Group differences in basal forebrain and other brain 
volumes of interest were assessed using Bayesian ANCOVA. We assessed the 
diagnostic utility of MRI based patterns of brain atrophy using voxel-based 
receiver operating characteristics and random forest analyses.
RESULTS: In the NACC sample, we found moderate evidence for the absence of a 
difference in basal forebrain volumes between AD, TDP-43, and mixed pathologies 
(Bayes factor(BF)10 = 0.324), and very strong evidence for lower hippocampus 
volume in TDP-43 and mixed cases compared with AD cases (BF10 = 156.1). The 
ratio of temporal to hippocampus volume reached an AUC of 75% for separating 
pure TDP-43 from pure AD cases. Random-forest analysis between TDP-43, AD, and 
mixed pathology reached only a multiclass AUC of 0.63 based on hippocampus, 
middle-inferior temporal gyrus, and amygdala volumes. Findings in the ADNI 
sample were consistent with these results.
CONCLUSION: A comparable degree of basal forebrain atrophy in pure TDP-43 cases 
compared to AD cases encourages studies on the effect of cholinergic treatment 
in amnestic dementia due to TDP-43. A distinct pattern of temporo-limbic brain 
atrophy may serve as a surrogate marker to enrich samples in clinical trials for 
the presence of TDP-43 pathology.

INTRODUCTION: The identification of early, preferably presymptomatic, biomarkers 
and true etiologic factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the first step toward 
establishing effective primary and secondary prevention programs. Consequently, 
the search for a relatively inexpensive and harmless biomarker for AD continues. 
Despite intensive research worldwide, to date there is no definitive plasma or 
blood biomarker indicating high or low risk of conversion to AD.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and β-amyloid (Aβ) levels in three blood 
compartments (diluted in plasma, undiluted in plasma and cell-bound) were 
measured in 96 subjects (33 with mild cognitive impairment, 14 with AD and 49 
healthy controls). Pearson correlations were completed between 113 regions of 
interest (ROIs) (45 subcortical and 68 cortical) and Aβ levels. Pearson 
correlation analyses adjusted for the covariates age, sex, apolipoprotein E 
(ApoE), education and creatinine levels showed neuroimaging ROIs were associated 
with Aβ levels. Two statistical methods were applied to study the major 
relationships identified: (1) Pearson correlation with phenotype added as a 
covariate and (2) a meta-analysis stratified by phenotype. Neuroimaging data and 
plasma Aβ measurements were taken from 630 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) subjects to be compared with our results.
RESULTS: The left hippocampus was the brain region most correlated with Aβ(1-40) 
bound to blood cell pellets (partial correlation (pcor) = -0.37, P = 0.0007) 
after adjustment for the covariates age, gender and education, ApoE and 
creatinine levels. The correlation remained almost the same (pcor = -0.35, 
P = 0.002) if phenotype is also added as a covariate. The association between 
both measurements was independent of cognitive status. The left hemisphere 
entorhinal cortex also correlated with Aβ(1-40) cell-bound fraction. AB128 and 
ADNI plasma Aβ measurements were not related to any brain morphometric 
measurement.
CONCLUSIONS: Association of cell-bound Aβ(1-40) in blood with left hippocampal 
volume was much stronger than previously observed in Aβ plasma fractions. If 
confirmed, this observation will require careful interpretation and must be 
taken into account for blood amyloid-based biomarker development.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating reports have suggested that α-synuclein is involved in 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
α-synuclein has been suggested as a potential biomarker of AD, this study was 
set out to test whether CSF α-synuclein is associated with other AD biomarkers 
and could predict neurodegeneration and clinical progression in non-demented 
elders.
METHODS: The associations between CSF α-synuclein and other AD biomarkers were 
investigated at baseline in non-demented Chinese elders. The predictive values 
of CSF α-synuclein for longitudinal neuroimaging change and the conversion risk 
of non-demented elders were assessed using linear mixed effects models and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, respectively, in the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
RESULTS: The CSF α-synuclein levels correlated with AD-specific biomarkers, CSF 
total tau and phosphorylated tau levels, in 651 Chinese Han participants 
(training set). These positive correlations were replicated in the ADNI database 
(validation set). Using a longitudinal cohort from ADNI, the CSF α-synuclein 
concentrations were found to increase with disease severity. The CSF α-synuclein 
had high diagnostic accuracy for AD based on the "ATN" (amyloid, tau, 
neurodegeneration) system (A + T+ versus A - T - control) (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84). Moreover, CSF α-synuclein 
predicted longitudinal hippocampus atrophy and conversion from MCI to AD 
dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF α-synuclein is associated with CSF tau levels and could predict 
neurodegeneration and clinical progression in non-demented elders. This finding 
indicates that CSF α-synuclein is a potentially useful early biomarker for AD.

PURPOSE: Precise and reproducible hippocampus outlining is important to quantify 
hippocampal atrophy caused by neurodegenerative diseases and to spare the 
hippocampus in whole brain radiation therapy when performing prophylactic 
cranial irradiation or treating brain metastases. This study aimed to quantify 
systematic differences between methods by comparing regional volume and outline 
reproducibility of manual, FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer hippocampus segmentations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a dataset from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative), including 20 healthy controls, 40 patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For 
each subject back-to-back (BTB) T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE images were acquired at 
time-point baseline (BL) and 12 months later (M12). Hippocampi segmentations of 
all methods were converted into triangulated meshes, regional volumes were 
extracted and regional Jaccard indices were computed between the hippocampi 
meshes of paired BTB scans to evaluate reproducibility. Regional volumes and 
Jaccard indices were modelled as a function of group (G), method (M), hemisphere 
(H), time-point (T), region (R) and interactions.
RESULTS: For the volume data the model selection procedure yielded the following 
significant main effects G, M, H, T and R and interaction effects G-R and M-R. 
The same model was found for the BTB scans. For all methods volumes reduces with 
the severity of disease. Significant fixed effects for the regional Jaccard 
index data were M, R and the interaction M-R. For all methods the middle region 
was most reproducible, independent of diagnostic group. FSL-FIRST was most and 
FreeSurfer least reproducible.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: A novel method to perform detailed analysis of subtle 
differences in hippocampus segmentation is proposed. The method showed that 
hippocampal segmentation reproducibility was best for FSL-FIRST and worst for 
Freesurfer. We also found systematic regional differences in hippocampal 
segmentation between different methods reinforcing the need of adopting 
harmonized protocols.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether transcriptional risk scores (TRSs), a summation 
of polarized expression levels of functional genes, reflect the risk of 
Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: Blood transcriptome data were from Caucasian participants, which 
included AD, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal controls (CN) in 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 661) and AddNeuroMed 
(n = 674) cohorts. To calculate TRSs, we selected functional genes that were 
expressed under the control of the AD risk loci and were identified as being 
responsible for AD by using Bayesian colocalization and mendelian randomization 
methods. Regression was used to investigate the association of the TRS with 
diagnosis (AD vs CN) and MRI biomarkers (entorhinal thickness and hippocampal 
volume). Regression was also used to evaluate whether expression of each 
functional gene was associated with AD diagnosis.
RESULTS: The TRS was significantly associated with AD diagnosis, hippocampal 
volume, and entorhinal cortical thickness in the ADNI. The association of the 
TRS with AD diagnosis and entorhinal cortical thickness was also replicated in 
AddNeuroMed. Among functional genes identified to calculate the TRS, CD33 and 
PILRA were significantly upregulated, and TRAPPC6A was significantly 
downregulated in patients with AD compared with CN, all of which were identified 
in the ADNI and replicated in AddNeuroMed.
CONCLUSIONS: The blood-based TRS is significantly associated with AD diagnosis 
and neuroimaging biomarkers. In blood, CD33 and PILRA were known to be 
associated with uptake of β-amyloid and herpes simplex virus 1 infection, 
respectively, both of which may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: The study is rated Class III because of the case 
control design and the risk of spectrum bias.

Tau proteins accumulation and their spreading pattern were affected by gender in 
cognitive impairment patients, especially in the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, it was unclear whether the gender effects for tau 
deposition influenced by amyloid deposition. The aim of this study was to 
investigate gender differences for tau depositions in Aβ positive (A+) subjects. 
In this study, tau and amyloid positron emission tomography images, structural 
magnetic resonance imaging images, and demographic information were collected 
from 179 subjects in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
and 63 subjects from Huashan Hospital. Subjects were classified as T+ or T- 
according to the presence or absence of tau (T) biomarkers. We used two-sample t 
test and one-way analysis of variance test to analyze the effect of gender with 
adjusting for age, years of education, and Minimum Mental State Examination. In 
the ADNI cohort, we found differences in Tau deposition in fusiform gyrus, 
inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus between 
the female T+ (FT+) and male T+ (MT+) groups (p < 0.05). Tau deposition did not 
differ significantly between female T- (FT-) and male T- (MT-) subjects 
(p > 0.05). In the Huashan Hospital cohort, there was no difference in Tau 
deposition between FT+ and MT+ (p > 0.05). The results show that tau depositions 
significantly increased in females in above brain regions. Our findings suggest 
that tau deposition is influenced by gender in the A+ subjects. This result has 
important clinical implications for the development of gender-guided early 
interventions for patients with both Tau and Amyloid depositions.

PURPOSE: To discover common biomarkers correlating with the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores from multi-country MRI datasets.
METHODS: The first dataset comprised 112 subjects (49 men, 63 women; range, 
46-94 years) at the National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center. A 
second dataset comprised 300 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database (177 men, 123 women; range, 57-91 years). 
Three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images were collected from both datasets. In 
total, 14 deep gray matter volumes and 70 cortical thicknesses were obtained 
from MR images using FreeSurfer software. Total hippocampal volume and the ratio 
of hippocampus to cerebral volume were also calculated. Correlations between 
each variable and MMSE scores were assessed using Pearson's correlation 
coefficient. Parameters with moderate correlation coefficients (r > 0.3) from 
each dataset were determined as independent variables and evaluated using 
general linear model (GLM) analyses.
RESULTS: In Pearson's correlation coefficient, total and bilateral hippocampal 
volumes, right amygdala volume, and right entorhinal cortex (ERC) thickness 
showed moderate correlation coefficients (r > 0.3) with MMSE scores from the 
first dataset. The ADNI dataset showed moderate correlations with MMSE scores in 
more variables, including bilateral ERC thickness and hippocampal volume. GLM 
analysis revealed that right ERC thickness correlated significantly with MMSE 
score in both datasets. Cortical thicknesses of the left parahippocampal gyrus, 
left inferior parietal lobe, and right fusiform gyrus also significantly 
correlated with MMSE score in the ADNI dataset (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A positive correlation between right ERC thickness and MMSE score 
was identified from multi-country datasets.

OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal MRI studies are often subjected to mid-study scanner 
changes, which may alter image characteristics such as contrast, signal-to-noise 
ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, intensity non-uniformity and geometric 
distortion. Measuring brain volume loss under these conditions can render the 
results potentially unreliable across the timepoint of the change. Estimating 
and accounting for this effect may improve the reliability of estimates of brain 
atrophy rates.
METHODS: We analyzed 237 subjects who were scanned at 1.5 T for the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and were subject to intra-vendor or 
inter-vendor scanner changes during follow-up (up to 8 years). Sixty-three 
subjects scanned on GE Signa HDx and HDxt platforms were also subject to a 
T1-weighted sequence change from Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo 
(MP-RAGE) to Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo with IR Preparation (IR-FSPGR), as part 
of the transition from ADNI-1 to ADNI-2/GO. Two-timepoint percentage brain 
volume changes (PBVCs) between the baseline "screening" and the follow-up scans 
were calculated using SIENA. A linear mixed-effects model with subject-specific 
random slopes and intercepts was applied to estimate the fixed effects of 
scanner hardware changes on the PBVC measures. The same model also included a 
term to estimate the fixed effects of the T1-weighted sequence change.
RESULTS: Different hardware upgrade or change combinations led to different 
offsets in the PBVC (SE; p): Philips Intera to Siemens Avanto, -1.81% (0.30; 
p < 0.0001); GE Genesis Signa to Philips Intera, 0.99% (0.47, p = 0.042); GE 
Signa Excite to Signa HDx, 0.33% (0.095, p = 0.0005); GE Signa Excite to Signa 
HDxt, -0.023% (0.23, p = 0.92); GE Signa Excite to Signa HDx to Signa HDxt, 
0.25% (0.095, p = 0.010) and 0.27% (0.16, p = 0.098), respectively; GE Signa HDx 
to Signa HDxt, -0.24% (0.25, p = 0.34); Siemens Symphony to Symphony TIM, -0.39% 
(0.16; p = 0.019). The sequence change from MP-RAGE to IR-SPGR was associated 
with an average -1.63% (0.12; p < 0.0001) change.
CONCLUSION: Inter-vendor scanner changes generally led to greater effects on 
PBVC measurements than did intra-vendor scanner upgrades. The effect of 
T1-weighted sequence change was comparable to that of the inter-vendor scanner 
changes. Inclusion of the corrective fixed-effects terms for the scanner 
hardware and T1-weighted sequence changes yielded better model goodness-of-fits, 
and thus, potentially more reliable estimates of whole-brain atrophy rates.

Previous research has emphasized the unique impact of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
pathology on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a reflection that tau pathology is 
particularly striking in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortex (ERC, TEC) 
early in the course of disease. However, other brain regions are affected by AD 
pathology during its early phases. Here, we use longitudinal diffeomorphometry 
to measure the atrophy rate from MRI of the amygdala compared with that in the 
ERC and TEC in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls, CU individuals who 
progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with MCI who 
progressed to dementia of the AD type (DAT), using a dataset from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results show 
significantly higher atrophy rates of the amygdala in both groups of 
'converters' (CU→MCI, MCI→DAT) compared to controls, with rates of volume loss 
comparable to rates of thickness loss in the ERC and TEC. We localize atrophy 
within the amygdala within each of these groups using fixed effects modeling. 
Controlling for the familywise error rate highlights the medial regions of the 
amygdala as those with significantly higher atrophy in both groups of converters 
than in controls. Using our recently developed method, referred to as Projective 
LDDMM, we map measures of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) from digital 
pathology to MRI atlases and reconstruct dense 3D spatial distributions of NFT 
density within regions of the MTL. The distribution of NFTs is consistent with 
the spatial distribution of MR measured atrophy rates, revealing high densities 
(and atrophy) in the amygdala (particularly medial), ERC, and rostral third of 
the MTL. The similarity of the location of NFTs in AD and shape changes in a 
well-defined clinical population suggests that amygdalar atrophy rate, as 
measured through MRI may be a viable biomarker for AD.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) promotes neuronal survival downstream. 
This longitudinal study evaluated whether the TNFRSF1B gene encoding TNFR2 and 
levels of its soluble form (sTNFR2) affect Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers and 
clinical outcomes. Data analyzed included 188 patients in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and AD dementia. Further, a replication study was performed in 48 patients with 
MCI with positive AD biomarkers who were treated at a memory clinic. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTNFR2 levels along with two related TNFRSF1B gene 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs976881 and rs1061622 were assessed. 
General linear models were used to evaluate the effect of CSF sTNFR2 levels and 
each SNP in relationship to CSF t-tau and p-tau, cognitive domains, MRI brain 
measures, and longitudinal cognitive changes after adjustments were made for 
covariates such as APOE ε4 status. In the ADNI cohort, a significant interaction 
between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF t-tau and p-tau levels; 
hippocampal and whole brain volumes; and Digit Span Forwards subtest scores. In 
the replication cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 modulates CSF p-tau. A significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 also impacts Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores over 12 months 
in the ADNI cohort. The interaction between TNFRSF1B variant rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 levels was noted to modulate multiple AD-associated severity markers and 
cognitive domains. This interaction impacts resilience-related clinical outcomes 
in AD and lends support to sTNFR2 as a promising candidate for therapeutic 
targeting to improve clinical outcomes of interest.

Individualized Assessment of Brain Aβ Deposition With fMRI Using Deep Learning.

Li C, Liu M, Xia J, Mei L, Yang Q, Shi F, Zhang H, Shen D.

PET-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) assessment has many limitations in 
large-scale screening. Non-invasive techniques such as resting-state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been proven valuable in early AD 
diagnosis. This study investigated feasibility of using rs-fMRI, especially 
functional connectivity (FC), for individualized assessment of brain amyloid-β 
deposition derived from PET. We designed a graph convolutional networks (GCNs) 
and random forest (RF) based integrated framework for using rs-fMRI-derived 
multi-level FC networks to predict amyloid-β PET patterns with the OASIS-3 (N = 
258) and ADNI-2 (N = 291) datasets. Our method achieved satisfactory accuracy 
not only in Aβ-PET grade classification (for negative, intermediate, and 
positive grades, with accuracy in the three-class classification as 62.8% and 
64.3% on two datasets, respectively), but also in prediction of whole-brain 
region-level Aβ-PET standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) (with the mean square 
errors as 0.039 and 0.074 for two datasets, respectively). Model 
interpretability examination also revealed the contributive role of the limbic 
network. This study demonstrated high feasibility and reproducibility of using 
low-cost, more accessible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to approximate 
PET-based diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are prescribed for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and sometimes for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) without knowing 
underlying pathologies and its effect on cognition. We investigated the 
frequency of ChEI prescriptions in amyloid-negative MCI and their association 
with cognitive changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
cohort.
METHODS: We included participants with amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET)-negative MCI from the ADNI. We analyzed the associations of ChEI use with 
cognitive changes, brain volume, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau 
(t-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and p-tau181/t-tau ratio.
RESULTS: ChEIs were prescribed in 27.4% of amyloid PET-negative MCI and were 
associated with faster cognitive decline, reduced baseline hippocampal volume 
and entorhinal cortical thickness, and a longitudinal decrease in the frontal 
lobe cortical thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between ChEI use and accelerated cognitive decline 
may stem from underlying pathologies involving reduced hippocampal volume, 
entorhinal cortical thickness and faster frontal lobe atrophy. We suggest that 
ChEI use in amyloid PET-negative MCI patients might need further consideration, 
and studies investigating the causality between ChEI use and cognitive decline 
are warranted in the future.

BACKGROUND: The frontal lobe is affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). However, we still lack sufficient understanding of 
subregion atrophy in the frontal cortex, and the relationship between subregions 
volume and cognitive decline in AD or MCI remains unclear.
METHODS: This study enrolled 434 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 150 cognitively normals (CN), 187 
subjects with MCI, and 97 patients with AD. The gray matter of frontal regions 
and subregions was divided based on the BNA-246 atlas and its volume was 
measured by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Analysis of covariance was performed 
to compare the differences in frontal regions and subregions volume. Then, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) 
were used to analyze the discriminative ability of subregion volume to 
distinguish the three groups. In addition, we investigated the association of 
subregion volume with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Behavior section (ADAS-cog) scores with age, 
gender, education, and the estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) as 
covariates.
RESULTS: In addition to the regions of frontal lobe atrophy found in previous 
studies, atrophy of the precentral gyrus (PrG) and some of its subregions were 
found in MCI. The volume of the right dorsal area 9/46 (MFG_7_1) was the best 
index to differentiate AD from CN, with an AUC value of 0.7. Moreover, we found 
that some subregions are associated with cognition in patients with MCI and AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Frontal lobe atrophy in MCI is more extensive than we assumed. In 
addition, the volume of right MFG_7_1 has the potential to distinguish AD from 
CN.

UNC5C, which is a transmembrane receptor for netrin-1 to trigger the apoptosis, 
has been confirmed as a new risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently. 
However, there is lack of the evidence on the brain structure associated with 
the polymorphisms of UNC5C in AD. The objective of this study is to investigate 
the influence of UNC5C loci on the neuroimaging of strategic regions of AD. In 
812 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset, we explored the genotypes of UNC5C loci in the volumes of the 
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, middle temporal 
and precuneus, and the thickness of the entorhinal cortex which are measured by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also investigated the atrophy rate of above 
structures influenced by UNC5C loci using the longitudinal data. UNC5C loci were 
associated with the volume of right middle temporal (rs34585936 Pc = 0.0031). 
Meanwhile, the polymorphisms of UNC5C loci could alter the atrophy rate of 
strategic regions especially the left hippocampus (rs72672784 Pc = 0.0090; 
rs13120458 Pc = 0.0434; rs34875919 Pc = 0.0434) and right precuneus (rs72672784 
Pc = 0.0068; rs2001246 Pc = 0.0055; rs74690179 Pc = 0.0055). UNC5C genotypes 
were significantly associated with the volume of the middle temporal on MRI; 
meanwhile, UNC5C loci could alter the atrophy of strategic regions of AD such as 
the hippocampus and precuneus. And the above effects of polymorphisms of UNC5C 
were more obvious in the population with the impaired cognition than those with 
the normal cognition.

Black-box deep learning (DL) models trained for the early detection of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) often lack systematic model interpretation. This work 
computes the activated brain regions during DL and compares those with classical 
Machine Learning (ML) explanations. The architectures used for DL were 3D 
DenseNets, EfficientNets, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) networks. The 
classical models include Random Forests (RFs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM), 
Decision Trees (DTs), and Logistic Regression (LR). For explanations, SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic 
Explanations (LIME), Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), 
GradCAM++ and permutation-based feature importance were implemented. During 
interpretation, correlated features were consolidated into aspects. All models 
were trained on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. 
The validation includes internal and external validation on the Australian 
Imaging and Lifestyle flagship study of Ageing (AIBL) and the Open Access Series 
of Imaging Studies (OASIS). DL and ML models reached similar classification 
performances. Regarding the brain regions, both types focus on different 
regions. The ML models focus on the inferior and middle temporal gyri, and the 
hippocampus, and amygdala regions previously associated with AD. The DL models 
focus on a wider range of regions including the optical chiasm, the entorhinal 
cortices, the left and right vessels, and the 4th ventricle which were partially 
associated with AD. One explanation for the differences is the input features 
(textures vs. volumes). Both types show reasonable similarity to a ground truth 
Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis. Slightly higher similarities were 
measured for ML models.

Brain aging is becoming an increasingly important topic, and the norms of brain 
structures are essential for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. However, 
previous studies of the aging brain have mostly focused on Caucasians, not East 
Asians. The aim of this paper was to examine ethnic differences in the aging 
process of brain structures or to determine to what extent ethnicity affects the 
normative values of lobar and subcortical volumes in clinically normal elderly 
and the diagnosis in multi-racial patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lobar 
and subcortical volumes were measured using FreeSurfer from MRI data of 1,686 
normal Koreans (age range 59-89) and 851 Caucasian, non-Hispanic subjects in the 
ADNI and OASIS datasets. The regression models were designed to predict brain 
volumes, including ethnicity, age, sex, intracranial volume (ICV), magnetic 
field strength (MFS), and MRI scanner manufacturers as independent variables. 
Ethnicity had a significant effect for all lobar (|β| > 0.20, p < 0.001) and 
subcortical regions (|β| > 0.08, p < 0.001) except left pallidus and bilateral 
ventricles. To demonstrate the validity of the z-score for AD diagnosis, 420 
patients and 420 normal controls were selected evenly from the Korean and 
Caucasian datasets. The four validation groups divided by race and diagnosis 
were matched on age and sex using a propensity score matching. We analyzed 
whether and to what extent the ethnicity adjustment improved the diagnostic 
power of the logistic regression model that was built using the only z-scores of 
six regions: bilateral temporal cortices, hippocampi, and amygdalae. The 
performance of the classifier after ethnicity adjustment was significantly 
improved compared with the classifier before ethnicity adjustment (ΔAUC = 0.10, 
D = 7.80, p < 0.001; AUC comparison test using bootstrap). Korean AD dementia 
patients may not be classified by Caucasian norms of brain volumes because the 
brain regions vulnerable to AD dementia are bigger in normal Korean elderly 
peoples. Therefore, ethnicity is an essential factor in establishing normative 
data for regional volumes in brain aging and applying it to the diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Identifying predictors of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
critically important for AD prevention and targeted treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To compare various clinical and biomarker trajectories for tracking 
progression and predicting conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to 
probable AD.
METHODS: Participants were from the ADNI-1 study. We assessed the ability of 33 
longitudinal biomarkers to predict time to AD conversion, accounting for 
demographic and genetic factors. We used joint modelling of longitudinal and 
survival data to examine the association between changes of measures and disease 
progression. We also employed time-dependent receiver operating characteristic 
method to assess the discriminating capability of the measures.
RESULTS: 23 of 33 longitudinal clinical and imaging measures are significant 
predictors of AD conversion beyond demographic and genetic factors. The strong 
phenotypic and biological predictors are in the cognitive domain (ADAS-Cog; 
RAVLT), functional domain (FAQ), and neuroimaging domain (middle temporal gyrus 
and hippocampal volume). The strongest predictor is ADAS-Cog 13 with an increase 
of one SD in ADAS-Cog 13 increased the risk of AD conversion by 2.92 times.
CONCLUSION: Prediction of AD conversion can be improved by incorporating 
longitudinal change information, in addition to baseline characteristics. 
Cognitive measures are consistently significant and generally stronger 
predictors than imaging measures.

To assess plasma phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) as a progression biomarker in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examined longitudinal plasma p-tau181 of 1184 
participants (403 cognitively normal (CN), 560 patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and 221 with AD dementia) from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The plasma p-tau level was increased at baseline 
for MCI and AD dementia (mean: CN, 15.4 pg/mL; MCI, 18.4 pg/mL; AD dementia, 
23.7 pg/mL; P < 0.001) and increased significantly over time at preclinical 
(Aβ-positive CN), prodromal (Aβ-positive MCI), and dementia (Aβ-positive 
dementia) stage of AD. A longitudinal increase of plasma p-tau181 was associated 
with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels (low Aβ42, high 
phosphorylated tau, and high total tau, all P < 0.001), amyloid accumulation 
(P < 0.001) and hypometabolism (P = 0.002) on positron emission tomography, 
atrophy in structure imaging (small hippocampal (P = 0.030), middle temporal 
(P = 0.008), and whole brain (P = 0.027) volume, and large ventricular volume 
(P = 0.008)), and deteriorated cognitive performance (global cognition and 
memory, language, executive function, and visuospatial function, all P < 0.050) 
at baseline. Furthermore, longitudinal plasma p-tau181 correlated with 
concurrent changes of nearly all these AD-related hallmarks and faster increase 
in plasma p-tau181 correlated with faster worsening cognition in all diagnostic 
groups. Importantly, most associations remained significant in Aβ-positive group 
and became non-significant in Aβ-negative group. Longitudinal analyses of plasma 
p-tau181 suggest its potential as a noninvasive biomarker to track disease 
progression in AD and to monitor effects of disease-modifying therapeutics in 
clinical trials.

Hippocampus atrophy is an early structural feature that can be measured from 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve the diagnosis of neurological 
diseases. An accurate and robust standardized hippocampus segmentation method is 
required for reliable atrophy assessment. The aim of this work was to develop 
and evaluate an automatic segmentation tool (DeepHarp) for hippocampus 
delineation according to the ADNI harmonized hippocampal protocol (HarP). 
DeepHarp utilizes a two-step process. First, the approximate location of the 
hippocampus is identified in T1-weighted MRI datasets using an atlas-based 
approach, which is used to crop the images to a region-of-interest (ROI) 
containing the hippocampus. In the second step, a convolutional neural network 
trained using datasets with corresponding manual hippocampus annotations is used 
to segment the hippocampus from the cropped ROI. The proposed method was 
developed and validated using 107 datasets with manually segmented hippocampi 
according to the ADNI-HarP standard as well as 114 multi-center datasets of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular 
disease, and healthy controls. Twenty-three independent datasets manually 
segmented according to the ADNI-HarP protocol were used for testing to assess 
the accuracy, while an independent test-retest dataset was used to assess 
precision. The proposed DeepHarp method achieved a mean Dice similarity score of 
0.88, which was significantly better than four other established hippocampus 
segmentation methods used for comparison. At the same time, the proposed method 
also achieved a high test-retest precision (mean Dice score: 0.95). In 
conclusion, DeepHarp can automatically segment the hippocampus from T1-weighted 
MRI datasets according to the ADNI-HarP protocol with high accuracy and 
robustness, which can aid atrophy measurements in a variety of pathologies.

Over the past 30 years, magnetic resonance imaging has become a ubiquitous tool 
for accurately visualizing the change and development of the brain's subcortical 
structures (e.g., hippocampus). Although subcortical structures act as 
information hubs of the nervous system, their quantification is still in its 
infancy due to many challenges in shape extraction, representation, and 
modeling. Here, we develop a simple and efficient framework of longitudinal 
elastic shape analysis (LESA) for subcortical structures. Integrating ideas from 
elastic shape analysis of static surfaces and statistical modeling of sparse 
longitudinal data, LESA provides a set of tools for systematically quantifying 
changes of longitudinal subcortical surface shapes from raw structure MRI data. 
The key novelties of LESA include: (i) it can efficiently represent complex 
subcortical structures using a small number of basis functions and (ii) it can 
accurately delineate the spatiotemporal shape changes of the human subcortical 
structures. We applied LESA to analyze three longitudinal neuroimaging data sets 
and showcase its wide applications in estimating continuous shape trajectories, 
building life-span growth patterns, and comparing shape differences among 
different groups. In particular, with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) data, we found that the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) can 
significantly speed the shape change of ventricle and hippocampus from 60 to 75 
years old compared with normal aging.

INTRODUCTION: Abnormal gene expression patterns may contribute to the onset and 
progression of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
METHODS: We performed transcriptome-wide meta-analysis (N = 1440) of blood-based 
microarray gene expression profiles as well as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) endophenotype analysis.
RESULTS: We identified and replicated five genes (CREB5, CD46, TMBIM6, IRAK3, 
and RPAIN) as significantly dysregulated in LOAD. The most significantly altered 
gene, CREB5, was also associated with brain atrophy and increased amyloid beta 
(Aβ) accumulation, especially in the entorhinal cortex region. cis-expression 
quantitative trait loci mapping analysis of CREB5 detected five significant 
associations (P < 5 × 10-8 ), where rs56388170 (most significant) was also 
significantly associated with global cortical Aβ deposition measured by [18 
F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography and CSF Aβ1-42 .
DISCUSSION: RNA from peripheral blood indicated a differential gene expression 
pattern in LOAD. Genes identified have been implicated in biological processes 
relevant to Alzheimer's disease. CREB, in particular, plays a key role in 
nervous system development, cell survival, plasticity, and learning and memory.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with 
progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic 
resonance images (MRI) play important role to evaluate the brain anatomical 
changes for AD Diagnosis. Machine learning technologies have been widely studied 
on MRI computation and analysis for quantitative evaluation and 
computer-aided-diagnosis of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft 
features after image processing such as registration and segmentation, and then 
train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. Motivated by 
the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a 
classification method based on multiple cluster dense convolutional neural 
networks (DenseNets) to learn the various local features of MR brain images, 
which are combined for AD classification. First, we partition the whole brain 
image into different local regions and extract a number of 3D patches from each 
region. Second, the patches from each region are grouped into different clusters 
with the K-Means clustering method. Third, we construct a DenseNet to learn the 
patch features for each cluster and the features learned from the discriminative 
clusters of each region are ensembled for classification. Finally, the 
classification results from different local regions are combined to enhance 
final image classification. The proposed method can gradually learn the MRI 
features from the local patches to global image level for the classification 
task. There are no rigid registration and segmentation required for 
preprocessing MRI images. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted MRIs of 831 
subjects including 199 AD patients, 403 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 229 
normal control (NC) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an 
accuracy of 89.5% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.4% for AD vs. NC 
classification, and an accuracy of 73.8% and an AUC of 77.5% for MCI vs. NC 
classification, demonstrating the promising classification performances.

Fatigue is a common and distressful symptom in older people and has been 
associated with adverse health outcomes. Nevertheless, its sex-specific 
pathophysiological underpinnings and clinical correlates have been scarcely 
investigated. We aimed to comprehensively explore the clinical and 
neurobiological determinants of fatigue in cognitively unimpaired older adults. 
A sex-stratified analysis was conducted to look for differences in the clinical 
expression of fatigue among women and men. Data on cognitively normal 
individuals were gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) 2 study. Fatigue was defined based on self-report at baseline. For each 
participant, information on sociodemographics, comorbidities, mood, cognitive 
performance, frailty, and biomarkers of brain pathology was collected. Logistic 
regression models, stratified by sex, were conducted to explore the factors 
associated with fatigue. Among the 291 participants selected, 44 subjects (15.1% 
of the total sample) self-reported fatigue at baseline. Subjects reporting 
fatigue were more likely women, had higher frailty degrees, and more severe 
depressive symptoms than those without fatigue. Moreover, they tended to have 
lower MRI hippocampus volumes. Among women, those reporting fatigue exhibited 
higher frailty levels, worse depression, and lower MRI hippocampus volumes 
relative to those without fatigue. Higher frailty degrees were also observed in 
men reporting vs. non-reporting fatigue. In the adjusted logistic regression 
model, more severe depression (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.28; p < 0.01) and lower 
MRI hippocampus volumes (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.90; p = 0.03) resulted 
independently associated with fatigue in women, while higher frailty degrees (OR 
3.10, 95% CI 1.27-7.54 per 0.1 increase in a 39-item Frailty index; p = 0.01) in 
men. Fatigue is a complex symptom with a sex-specific pattern of clinical and 
neurobiological correlates. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
of these associations is warranted to develop sex-informed approaches for 
personalized treatments.

The prognosis and treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
have been among the most important and challenging problems over the last few 
decades. To better understand the mechanism of AD, it is of great interest to 
identify genetic variants associated with brain atrophy. Commonly, in these 
analyses, neuroimaging features are extracted based on one of many possible 
brain atlases with FreeSurf and other popular software; this, however, may cause 
the loss of important information due to our incomplete knowledge about brain 
function embedded in these suboptimal atlases. To address the issue, we propose 
convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to three-dimensional MRI data 
for the whole brain or multiple, divided brain regions to perform completely 
data-driven and automatic feature extraction. These image-derived features are 
then used as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to 
identify associated genetic variants. When we applied this method to ADNI data, 
we identified several associated SNPs that have been previously shown to be 
related to several neurodegenerative/mental disorders, such as AD, depression, 
and schizophrenia.

Many neuroimaging studies collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
data in a longitudinal manner. However, the current fMRI literature lacks a 
general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI 
data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel 
longitudinal FC model using a variance components approach. First, for all 
subjects' visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time 
series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least 
squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared 
across the population, 2) the baseline FC strength, and 3) the FC's longitudinal 
trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the 
within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the 
subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in 
fMRI time series data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to 
make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation 
testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in the baseline 
FC network and change in FC over longitudinal time between a set of patients and 
a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of 
simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Overall, we found 
no difference in the global FC network between Alzheimer's disease patients and 
healthy controls, but did find differing local aging patterns in the FC between 
the left hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex.

Whether the deleterious effects of APOE4 are restricted to the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) spectrum or cause cognitive impairment irrespectively of the 
development of AD is still a matter of debate, and the focus of this study. Our 
analyses included APOE4 genotype, neuropsychological variables, amyloid-βeta 
(Aβ) and Tau markers, FDG-PET values, and hippocampal volumetry data derived 
from the healthy controls sample of the ADNI database. We formed 4 groups of 
equal size (n = 30) based on APOE4 carriage and amyloid-PET status. Baseline and 
follow-up (i.e., 48 months post-baseline) results indicated that Aβ-positivity 
was the most important factor to explain poorer cognitive performance, while 
APOE4 only exerted a significant effect in Aβ-positive subjects. Additionally, 
multiple regression analyses evidenced that, within the Aβ-positive sample, 
hippocampal volumetry explained most of the variability in cognitive performance 
for APOE4 carriers. These findings represent a strong support for the so-called 
preclinical/prodromal hypothesis, which states that the reported differences in 
cognitive performance between healthy carriers and non-carriers are mainly due 
to the APOE4's capability to increase the risk of AD. Moreover, our results 
reinforce the notion that a synergistic interaction of Aβ and APOE4 elicits a 
neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus that might be the main cause of 
impaired cognitive performance.

Surrogates of whole-brain white matter (WM) networks reconstructed using 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are novel markers of structural brain 
connectivity. Global connectivity of networks has been found impaired in 
clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively healthy aging. We 
hypothesized that network alterations are detectable already in preclinical AD 
and investigated major global WM network properties. Other structural markers of 
neurodegeneration typically affected in prodromal AD but seeming largely 
unimpaired in preclinical AD were also examined. 12 cognitively healthy elderly 
with preclinical AD as classified by florbetapir-PET (mean age 73.4 ± 4.9) and 
31 age-matched controls without cerebral amyloidosis (mean age 73.1 ± 6.7) from 
the ADNI were included. WM networks were reconstructed from DTI using 
tractography and graph theory. Indices of network capacity and the established 
imaging markers of neurodegeneration hippocampal volume, and cerebral glucose 
utilization as measured by fludeoxyglucose-PET were compared between the two 
groups. Additionally, we measured surrogates of global WM integrity (fractional 
anisotropy, mean diffusivity, volume). We found an increase of shortest path 
length and a decrease of global efficiency in preclinical AD. These results 
remained largely unchanged when controlling for WM integrity. In contrast, 
neither markers of neurodegeneration nor WM integrity were altered in 
preclinical AD subjects. Our results suggest an impairment of WM networks in 
preclinical AD that is detectable while other structural imaging markers do not 
yet indicate incipient neurodegeneration. Moreover, these findings are specific 
to WM networks and cannot be explained by other surrogates of global WM 
integrity.

Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Whole Brain Hierarchical Network.

Liu J, Li M, Lan W, Wu FX, Pan Y, Wang J.

Regions of interest (ROIs) based classification has been widely investigated for 
analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to assist the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) including its early warning and developing 
stages, e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) including MCI converted to AD 
(MCIc) and MCI not converted to AD (MCInc). Since an ROI representation of brain 
structures is obtained either by pre-definition or by adaptive parcellation, the 
corresponding ROI in different brains can be measured. However, due to noise and 
small sample size of MRI images, representations generated from single or 
multiple ROIs may not be sufficient to reveal the underlying anatomical 
differences between the groups of disease-affected patients and health controls 
(HC). In this paper, we employ a whole brain hierarchical network (WBHN) to 
represent each subject. The whole brain of each subject is divided into 90, 54, 
14, and 1 regions based on Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. The 
connectivity between each pair of regions is computed in terms of Pearson's 
correlation coefficient and used as classification feature. Then, to reduce the 
dimensionality of features, we select the features with higher scores. Finally, 
we use multiple kernel boosting (MKBoost) algorithm to perform the 
classification. Our proposed method is evaluated on MRI images of 710 subjects 
(200 AD, 120 MCIc, 160 MCInc, and 230 HC) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our 
proposed method achieves an accuracy of 94.65 percent and an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.954 for AD/HC 
classification, an accuracy of 89.63 percent and an AUC of 0.907 for AD/MCI 
classification, an accuracy of 85.79 percent and an AUC of 0.826 for MCI/HC 
classification, and an accuracy of 72.08 percent and an AUC of 0.716 for 
MCIc/MCInc classification, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our 
proposed method is efficient and promising for clinical applications for the 
diagnosis of AD via MRI images.

Volume and change in volume of the hippocampus are both important markers of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Delineation of the structure on MRI is time-consuming 
and therefore reliable automated methods are required. We describe an 
improvement (multiple-atlas propagation and segmentation (MAPS)) to our template 
library-based segmentation technique. The improved technique uses non-linear 
registration of the best-matched templates from our manually segmented library 
to generate multiple segmentations and combines them using the simultaneous 
truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) algorithm. Change in volume over 
12months (MAPS-HBSI) was measured by applying the boundary shift integral using 
MAPS regions. Methods were developed and validated against manual measures using 
subsets from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The best method 
was applied to 682 ADNI subjects, at baseline and 12-month follow-up, enabling 
assessment of volumes and atrophy rates in control, mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and AD groups, and within MCI subgroups classified by subsequent clinical 
outcome. We compared our measures with those generated by Surgical Navigation 
Technologies (SNT) available from ADNI. The accuracy of our volumes was one of 
the highest reported (mean(SD) Jaccard Index 0.80(0.04) (N=30)). Both MAPS 
baseline volume and MAPS-HBSI atrophy rate distinguished between control, MCI 
and AD groups. Comparing MCI subgroups (reverters, stable and converters): 
volumes were lower and rates higher in converters compared with stable and 
reverter groups (p< or =0.03). MAPS-HBSI required the lowest sample sizes (78 
subjects) for a hypothetical trial. In conclusion, the MAPS and MAPS-HBSI 
methods give accurate and reliable volumes and atrophy rates across the clinical 
spectrum from healthy aging to AD.

In this study, structural images of 1048 healthy subjects from the Human 
Connectome Project Young Adult study and 94 from ADNI-3 study were processed by 
an in-house tractography pipeline and analyzed together with pre-processed data 
of the same subjects from braingraph.org. Whole brain structural connectome 
features were used to build a simple correlation-based regression machine 
learning model to predict intelligence and age of healthy subjects. Our results 
showed that different forms of intelligence as well as age are predictable to a 
certain degree from diffusion tensor imaging detecting anatomical fiber tracts 
in the living human brain. Though we did not identify significant differences in 
the prediction capability for the investigated features depending on the imaging 
feature extraction method, we did find that crystallized intelligence was 
consistently better predictable than fluid intelligence from structural 
connectivity data through all datasets. Our findings suggest a practical and 
scalable processing and analysis framework to explore broader research topics 
employing brain MR imaging.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has come to be recognized as a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with poorly understood underlying mechanisms. We 
hypothesized that a history of TBI would be associated with greater tau 
deposition in elders with high-risk for dementia. A Groups of 20 participants 
with self-reported history of TBI and 100 without any such history were scanned 
using [18F]-AV1451 positron emission tomography as part of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Scans were stratified into four groups 
according to TBI history, and by clinical dementia rating scores into 
cognitively normal (CDR = 0) and those showing cognitive decline (CDR ≥ 0.5). We 
pursued voxel-based group comparison of [18F]-AV1451 uptake to identify the 
effect of TBI history on brain tau deposition, and for voxel-wise correlation 
analyses between [18F]-AV1451 uptake and different neuropsychological measures 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Compared to the TBI-/CDR ≥ 0.5 group, 
the TBI+/CDR ≥ 0.5 group showed increased tau deposition in the temporal pole, 
hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior and middle temporal gyri. Furthermore, 
the extent of tau deposition in the brain of those with TBI history positively 
correlated with the extent of cognitive decline, CSF-tau, and CSF-amyloid. This 
might suggest TBI to increase the risk for tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease 
later in life.

INTRODUCTION: Tau PET imaging has emerged as an important tool to detect and 
monitor tangle burden in vivo in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous 
studies demonstrated the association of tau burden with cognitive decline in 
probable AD cohorts. This study introduces a novel approach to analyze tau PET 
data by constructing individualized tau network structure and deriving its graph 
theory-based measures. We hypothesize that the network- based measures are a 
measure of the total tau load and the stage through disease.
METHODS: Using tau PET data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative from 369 
participants, we determine the network measures, global efficiency, global 
strength, and limbic strength, and compare with two regional measures entorhinal 
and tau composite SUVR, in the ability to differentiate, cognitively unimpaired 
(CU), MCI and AD. We also investigate the correlation of these network and 
regional measures and a measure of memory performance, auditory verbal learning 
test for long-term recall memory (AVLT-LTM). Finally, we determine the stages 
based on global efficiency and limbic strength using conditional inference trees 
and compare with Braak staging.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that the derived network measures are able to 
differentiate three clinical stages of AD, CU, MCI, and AD. We also demonstrate 
that these network measures are strongly correlated with memory performance 
overall. Unlike regional tau measurements, the tau network measures were 
significantly associated with AVLT-LTM even in cognitively unimpaired 
individuals. Stages determined from global efficiency and limbic strength, 
visually resembled Braak staging.
DISCUSSION: The strong correlations with memory particularly in CU suggest the 
proposed technique may be used to characterize subtle early tau accumulation. 
Further investigation is ongoing to examine this technique in a longitudinal 
setting.

BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common and problematic symptom of several 
neurodegenerative illnesses, but its neuroanatomical bases are not understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the regions associated with apathy in subjects with mild 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a method that accounts for the significant 
co-linearity of regional atrophy and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
METHODS: We identified 57 subjects with mild AD (CDR = 1) and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We 
performed a multivariate multiple regression with LASSO regularization on all 
symptom subscales of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the whole-brain ROI 
volumes calculated from their baseline MRIs with FreeSurfer. We compared our 
results to those from a previous study using the same method in patients with 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS).
RESULTS: Of neuropsychiatric symptoms, apathy showed the most robust 
neuroanatomical associations in the AD subjects. Atrophy of the following 
regions were independently associated with apathy: the ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; posterior cingulate cortex and adjacent 
lateral cortex; and the bank of the superior temporal sulcus. These results 
replicate previous studies using FTD and CBS patients, mostly agree with the 
previous literature on apathy in AD, and correspond to the Medial and Orbital 
Prefrontal Cortex networks identified in non-human primates.
CONCLUSION: The current study, previous studies from our laboratory, and the 
previous literature suggest that impairment of the same brain networks involved 
in arousal, threat response, and reward processing are associated with apathy in 
AD and FTD.

Objective: To delineate the relationship between clinical symptoms and tauopathy 
of the hippocampal subfields under different amyloid statuses. Methods: One 
hundred and forty-three subjects were obtained from the ADNI project, including 
87 individuals with normal cognition, 46 with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). All subjects underwent the tau PET, amyloid PET, 
T1W, and high-resolution T2W scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale cognition 13 (ADAS-cog-13) total score, comprising memory and executive 
function scores. The hippocampal subfields including Cornu Ammonis (CA1-3), 
subiculum (Sub), and dentate gyrus (DG), as well as the adjacent 
para-hippocampus (PHC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC), were segmented automatically 
using the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software. The 
relationship between tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal subfields and 
assessment scores was calculated using partial correlation analysis under 
different amyloid status, by controlling age, gender, education, apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) allele ɛ4 carrier status, and, time interval between the acquisition 
time of tau PET and amyloid PET scans. Results: Compared with amyloid negative 
(A-) group, individuals from amyloid positive (A+) group are more impaired based 
on the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE; p = 3.82e-05), memory (p = 
6.30e-04), executive function (p = 0.0016), and ADAS-cog-13 scores (p = 
5.11e-04). Significant decrease of volume (CA1, DG, and Sub) and increase of tau 
deposition (CA1, Sub, ERC, and PHC) of the hippocampal subfields of both 
hemispheres were observed for the A+ group compared to the A- group. Tauopathy 
of ERC is significantly associated with memory score for the A- group, and the 
associated regions spread into Sub and PHC for the A+ group. The relationship 
between the impairment of behavior or executive function and tauopathy of the 
hippocampal subfield was discovered within the A+ group. Leftward asymmetry was 
observed with the association between assessment scores and tauopathy of the 
hippocampal subfield, which is more prominent for the NPI score for the A+ 
group. Conclusion: The associations of tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal 
subfields with clinical symptoms provide additional insight into the 
understanding of local changes of the human HF during the AD continuum and can 
be used as a reference for future studies.

BACKGROUND: The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure, comprising 
histologically and functionally distinguishable hippocampal subfields. The 
volume reductions in hippocampal subfields have been demonstrated to be linked 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of our study is to investigate the 
hippocampal subfields' genetic architecture based on the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set.
METHODS: After preprocessing the downloaded genetic variants and imaging data 
from the ADNI database, a co-sparse reduced rank regression model was applied to 
analyze the genetic architecture of hippocampal subfields volumes. Homology 
modeling, docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and Co-IP experiments for 
protein-protein interactions were used to verify the function of target protein 
on hippocampal subfields successively. After that, the association analysis 
between the candidated genes on the hippocampal subfields volume and clinical 
scales were performed.
RESULTS: The results of the association analysis revealed five unique genetic 
variants (e.g., ubiquitin-specific protease 10 [USP10]) changed in nine 
hippocampal subfields (e.g., the granule cell and molecular layer of the dentate 
gyrus [GC-ML-DG]). Among five genetic variants, USP10 had the strongest 
interaction effect with BACE1, which affected hippocampal subfields verified by 
MD and Co-IP experiments. The results of association analysis between the 
candidated genes on the hippocampal subfields volume and clinical scales showed 
that candidated genes influenced the volume and function of hippocampal 
subfields.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that hippocampal subfields have partly 
distinct genetic architecture and may improve the sensitivity of the detection 
of AD.

OBJECTIVE: Metabolic biomarkers can potentially inform disease progression in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study is to identify and describe 
a new set of diagnostic biomarkers for developing deep learning (DL) tools to 
predict AD using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry 
(UPLC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics data.
METHODS: A total of 177 individuals, including 78 with AD and 99 with cognitive 
normal (CN), were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort along with 150 metabolomic biomarkers. We performed feature 
selection using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The 
H2O DL function was used to build multilayer feedforward neural networks to 
predict AD.
RESULTS: The LASSO selected 21 metabolic biomarkers. To develop DL models, the 
21 biomarkers identified by LASSO were imported into the H2O package. The data 
was split into 70% for training and 30% for validation. The best DL model with 
two layers and 18 neurons achieved an accuracy of 0.881, F1-score of 0.892, and 
AUC of 0.873. Several metabolomic biomarkers involved in glucose and lipid 
metabolism, in particular bile acid metabolites, were associated with APOE-ε4 
allele and clinical biomarkers (Aβ42, tTau, pTau), cognitive assessments [the 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS13), the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)], and hippocampus volume.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a new set of diagnostic metabolomic 
biomarkers for developing DL tools to predict AD. These biomarkers may help with 
early diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, and/or early treatment 
interventions for patients at risk for AD.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with 
a progressive loss of cognitive abilities. In the present report, we assessed 
the relationship of memory and executive function with brain structure in a 
sample of 810 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants, 
including 188 AD, 396 MCI, and 226 healthy older adults (HC). Composite scores 
of memory (ADNI-Mem) and executive function (ADNI-Exec) were generated by 
applying modern psychometric theory to item-level data from ADNI's 
neuropsychological battery. We performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and 
surface-based association (SurfStat) analyses to evaluate relationships of 
ADNI-Mem and ADNI-Exec with grey matter (GM) density and cortical thickness 
across the whole brain in the combined sample and within diagnostic groups. We 
observed strong associations between ADNI-Mem and medial and lateral temporal 
lobe atrophy. Lower ADNI-Exec scores were associated with advanced GM and 
cortical atrophy across broadly distributed regions, most impressively in the 
bilateral parietal and temporal lobes. We also evaluated ADNI-Exec adjusted for 
ADNI-Mem, and found associations with GM density and cortical thickness 
primarily in the bilateral parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes. Within-group 
analyses suggest these associations are strongest in patients with MCI and AD. 
The present study provides insight into the spatially unbiased associations 
between brain atrophy and memory and executive function, and underscores the 
importance of structural brain changes in early cognitive decline.

Link prediction is a promising research area for modeling various types of 
networks and has mainly focused on predicting missing links. Link prediction 
methods may be valuable for describing brain connectivity, as it changes in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
Here, we analyzed 3-tesla whole-brain diffusion-weighted images from 202 
participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) - 50 
healthy controls, 72 with earlyMCI (eMCI) and 38 with lateMCI (lMCI) and 42 AD 
patients. We introduce a novel approach for Mixed Link Prediction (MLP) to test 
and define the percent of predictability of each heightened stage of dementia 
from its previous, less impaired stage, in the simplest case. Using well-known 
link prediction algorithms as the core of MLP, we propose a new approach that 
predicts stages of cognitive impairment by simultaneously adding and removing 
links in the brain networks of elderly individuals. We found that the optimal 
algorithm, called "Adamic and Adar", had the best fit and most accurately 
predicted the stages of AD from their previous stage. When compared to the other 
link prediction algorithms, that mainly only predict the added links, our 
proposed approach can more inclusively simulate the brain changes during disease 
by both adding and removing links of the network. Our results are also in line 
with computational neuroimaging and clinical findings and can be improved for 
better results.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies revealed that abnormal deposition of 
tau spreads in a specific spatial pattern, namely Braak stage. However, Braak 
staging is based on post mortem brains, each of which represents the cross 
section of the tau trajectory in disease progression, and numerous studies were 
reported that do not conform to that model. This study thus aimed to identify 
the tau trajectory and quantify the tau progression in a data-driven approach 
with the continuous latent space learned by variational autoencoder (VAE).
METHODS: A total of 1080 [18F]Flortaucipir brain positron emission tomography 
(PET) images were collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. VAE was built to compress the hidden features from tau images 
in latent space. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering and minimum spanning tree 
(MST) were applied to organize the features and calibrate them to the tau 
progression, thus deriving pseudo-time. The image-level tau trajectory was 
inferred by continuously sampling across the calibrated latent features. We 
assessed the pseudo-time with regard to tau standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVr) in AD-vulnerable regions, amyloid deposit, glucose metabolism, cognitive 
scores, and clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: We identified four clusters that plausibly capture certain stages of AD 
and organized the clusters in the latent space. The inferred tau trajectory 
agreed with the Braak staging. According to the derived pseudo-time, tau first 
deposits in the parahippocampal and amygdala, and then spreads to the fusiform, 
inferior temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate. Prior to the regional tau 
deposition, amyloid accumulates first.
CONCLUSION: The spatiotemporal trajectory of tau progression inferred in this 
study was consistent with Braak staging. The profile of other biomarkers in 
disease progression agreed well with previous findings. We addressed that this 
approach additionally has the potential to quantify tau progression as a 
continuous variable by taking a whole-brain tau image into account.

OBJECTIVES: Hippocampal radiomic features (HRFs) can serve as biomarkers in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how different hippocampal segmentation 
methods affect HRFs in AD is still unknown. The aim of the study was to 
investigate how different segmentation methods affect HRF accuracy in AD 
analysis.
METHODS: A total of 1650 subjects were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI). The mini-mental state examination 
(MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog13) were also adopted. 
After calculating the HRFs of intensity, shape, and textural features from each 
side of the hippocampus in structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), the 
consistency of HRFs calculated from 7 different hippocampal segmentation methods 
was validated, and the performance of machine learning-based classification of 
AD vs. normal control (NC) adopting the different HRFs was also examined. 
Additional 571 subjects from the European DTI Study on Dementia database (EDSD) 
were to validate the consistency of results.
RESULTS: Between different segmentations, HRFs showed a high measurement 
consistency (R > 0.7), a high significant consistency between NC, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and AD (T-value plot, R > 0.8), and consistent significant 
correlations between HRFs and MMSE/ADAS-cog13 (p < 0.05). The best NC vs. AD 
classification was obtained when the hippocampus was sufficiently segmented by 
primitive majority voting (threshold = 0.2). High consistent results were 
reproduced from independent EDSD cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: HRFs exhibited high consistency across different hippocampal 
segmentation methods, and the best performance in AD classification was obtained 
when HRFs were extracted by the naïve majority voting method with a more 
sufficient segmentation and relatively low hippocampus segmentation accuracy.
KEY POINTS: • The hippocampal radiomic features exhibited high 
measurement/statistical/clinical consistency across different hippocampal 
segmentation methods. • The best performance in AD classification was obtained 
when hippocampal radiomics were extracted by the naïve majority voting method 
with a more sufficient segmentation and relatively low hippocampus segmentation 
accuracy.

Adaptive 3DCNN-based Interpretable Ensemble Model for Early Diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Pan D, Luo G, Zeng A, Zou C, Liang H, Wang J, Zhang T, Yang B; Alzheimer’s 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Adaptive interpretable ensemble model based on three-dimensional Convolutional 
Neural Network (3DCNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), i.e., 3DCNN+EL+GA, was 
proposed to differentiate the subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and further identify the discriminative brain regions 
significantly contributing to the classifications in a data-driven way. Plus, 
the discriminative brain sub-regions at a voxel level were further located in 
these achieved brain regions, with a gradient-based attribution method designed 
for CNN. Besides disclosing the discriminative brain sub-regions, the testing 
results on the datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) indicated that 
3DCNN+EL+GA outperformed other state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and 
that the achieved discriminative brain regions (e.g., the rostral hippocampus, 
caudal hippocampus, and medial amygdala) were linked to emotion, memory, 
language, and other essential brain functions impaired early in the AD process. 
Future research is needed to examine the generalizability of the proposed method 
and ideas to discern discriminative brain regions for other brain disorders, 
such as severe depression, schizophrenia, autism, and cerebrovascular diseases, 
using neuroimaging.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and 
previous studies have shown its association with accelerated aging. In this 
study, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that 
contributed to aging acceleration are also associated with the progression from 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. By applying genetic correlation analysis 
and single-locus survival analysis, we investigated the associations between 
intrinsic- and extrinsic-epigenetic-age-acceleration (IEAA and EEAA) related 
SNPs and the progression time from MCI to AD dementia using the data of 767 MCI 
participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study 
and 1 373 MCI patients from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) 
study. Genetic correlations were found between IEAA/EEAA and AD (positive for 
IEAA-AD and negative for EEAA-AD). We revealed that 70 IEAA and 81 EEAA SNPs had 
associations with the progression time from MCI to AD with Bayesian 
false-discovery probability ≤ 0.8 in the ADNI study, with 22 IEAA SNPs and 16 
EEAA SNPs being replicated in the NACC study (p < .05). Polygenic risk score 
(PRS) analysis showed that EEAA PRS but not IEAA PRS was associated with AD 
progression and the trend of decreasing fusiform gyrus volume in 2 data sets. 
Risk models incorporating both EAA PRSs did not show any significant improvement 
in predictive accuracy. Our results revealed multiple genetic variants with 
pleiotropic effects on both EAA and AD, which suggested shared genetic 
architecture between epigenetic age acceleration and AD progression.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the 
core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial. Further, due to 
the prevalence of co-pathologies, the precise role of WMH in cognition and 
neurodegeneration also remains uncertain.
METHODS: Herein, we analyzed 1803 participants with available WMH volume data, 
extracted from the ADNI database, including 756 cognitively normal controls, 783 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 264 patients with dementia. 
Participants were grouped according to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathology (A/T 
profile) severity. Linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the 
factors associated with WMH volume. Modeled by linear mixed-effects, the 
increase rates (Δ) of the WMH volume, cognition, and typical neurodegenerative 
markers were assessed. The predictive effectiveness of WMH volume was 
subsequently tested using Cox regression analysis, and the relationship between 
WMH/ΔWMH and other indicators such as cognition was explored through linear 
regression analyses. Furthermore, we explored the interrelationship among 
amyloid-β deposition, cognition, and WMH using mediation analysis.
RESULTS: Higher WMH volume was associated with older age, lower CSF amyloid-β 
levels, hypertension, and smoking history (all p ≤ 0.001), as well as cognitive 
status (MCI, p < 0.001; dementia, p = 0.008), but not with CSF tau levels. These 
results were further verified in any clinical stage, except hypertension and 
smoking history in the dementia stage. Although WMH could not predict dementia 
conversion, its increased levels at baseline were associated with a worse 
cognitive performance and a more rapid memory decline. Longitudinal analyses 
showed that baseline dementia and positive amyloid-β status were associated with 
a greater accrual of WMH volume, and a higher ΔWMH was also correlated with a 
faster cognitive decline. In contrast, except entorhinal cortex thickness, the 
WMH volume was not found to be associated with any other neurodegenerative 
markers. To a lesser extent, WMH mediates the relationship between amyloid-β and 
cognition.
CONCLUSION: WMH are non-specific lesions that are associated with amyloid-β 
deposition, cognitive status, and a variety of vascular risk factors. Despite 
evidence indicating only a weak relationship with neurodegeneration, early 
intervention to reduce WMH lesions remains a high priority for preserving 
cognitive function in the elderly.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to be important for 
neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus in nonhuman 
animals. The Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene, involving a valine (Val) to 
methionine (Met) substitution at codon 66, has been associated with lower BDNF 
secretion in vitro. However, there have been mixed results regarding 
associations between either circulating BDNF or the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism 
with hippocampal volume and memory in humans. The current study examined the 
association of BDNF genotype and plasma BDNF with hippocampal volume and memory 
in two large independent cohorts of middle-aged and older adults (both 
cognitively normal and early-stage dementia). Sample sizes ranged from 123 to 
649. Measures of the BDNF genotype, plasma BDNF, MRI-based hippocampal volume, 
and memory performance were obtained from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research 
Center (ADRC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). There 
were no significant differences between BDNF Met+ and Met- groups on either 
hippocampal volume or memory in either cohort. In addition, plasma BDNF was not 
significantly associated with either hippocampal volume or memory in either 
cohort. Neither age, cognitive status, nor gender moderated any of the 
relationships. Overall, current findings suggest that BDNF genotype and plasma 
BDNF may not be robust predictors for variance in hippocampal volume and memory 
in middle age and older adult cohorts.

Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) estimates 
microstructural properties of brain tissue relating to the organisation and 
processing capacity of neurites, which are essential elements for neuronal 
communication. Descriptive statistics of NODDI tissue metrics are commonly 
analyzed in regions-of-interest (ROI) to identify brain-phenotype associations. 
Here, the conventional method to calculate the ROI mean weights all voxels 
equally. However, this produces biased estimates in the presence of CSF partial 
volume. This study introduces the tissue-weighted mean, which calculates the 
mean NODDI metric across the tissue within an ROI, utilising the tissue fraction 
estimate from NODDI to reduce estimation bias. We demonstrate the proposed mean 
in a study of white matter abnormalities in young onset Alzheimer's disease 
(YOAD). Results show the conventional mean induces significant bias that 
correlates with CSF partial volume, primarily affecting periventricular regions 
and more so in YOAD subjects than in healthy controls. Due to the differential 
extent of bias between healthy controls and YOAD subjects, the conventional mean 
under- or over-estimated the effect size for group differences in many ROIs. 
This demonstrates the importance of using the correct estimation procedure when 
inferring group differences in studies where the extent of CSF partial volume 
differs between groups. These findings are robust across different acquisition 
and processing conditions. Bias persists in ROIs at higher image resolution, as 
demonstrated using data obtained from the third phase of the Alzheimer's disease 
neuroimaging initiative (ADNI); and when performing ROI analysis in template 
space. This suggests that conventional ROI means of NODDI metrics are biased 
estimates under most contemporary experimental conditions, the correction of 
which requires the proposed tissue-weighted mean. The tissue-weighted mean 
produces accurate estimates of ROI means and group differences when ROIs contain 
voxels with CSF partial volume. In addition to NODDI, the technique can be 
applied to other multi-compartment models that account for CSF partial volume, 
such as the free water elimination method. We expect the technique to help 
generate new insights into normal and abnormal variation in tissue 
microstructure of regions typically confounded by CSF partial volume, such as 
those in individuals with larger ventricles due to atrophy associated with 
neurodegenerative disease.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampus is one of the first structures affected by 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Hippocampal atrophy can be evaluated in terms of hippocampal 
volumes and shapes using structural MR images. However, the shape and volume 
features from hippocampus mask have limited discriminative information for AD 
diagnosis. In addition, extraction of these features is independent of 
classification model, resulting to sub-optimal performance for disease 
diagnosis.
NEW METHOD: This paper proposes a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural 
network for more detailed hippocampus analysis using structural MR images in AD. 
The DenseNets are constructed on the decomposed image patches of internal and 
external hippocampus to learn the intensity and shape features. Recurrent neural 
network (RNN) is cascaded to combine the features from the left and right 
hippocampus and learn the high-level features for disease classification.
RESULTS: Our proposed method is evaluated with the baseline MR images of 807 
subjects including 194 AD, 397 MCI and 216 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experiments show the proposed 
method achieves AUC (area under ROC curve) of 91.0%, 75.8% and 74.6% for 
classifications of AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI, respectively.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed method achieves better 
performance than the volume and shape analysis methods.
CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network was proposed by 
combining DenseNets and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) for 
hippocampus analysis and AD diagnosis. Results show its promising performance.

INTRODUCTION: Both elevated cortisol and hippocampal volume have been linked to 
an increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This 
longitudinal study assessed the effects of plasma cortisol on hippocampal 
atrophy and clinical progression rates in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Patients with amnestic MCI (n = 304) were selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) based on availability of baseline plasma 
cortisol and hippocampal volume measures, assessed at baseline and during 
follow-ups. We investigated associations between plasma cortisol, hippocampal 
volume, and risk of clinical progression to AD over a study period of up to 100 
months (mean follow-up time 36.8 months) using linear mixed models, Cox 
proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier estimators.
RESULTS: Plasma cortisol predicted greater hippocampal atrophy, such that 
participants with higher cortisol showed faster decline in hippocampal volume 
over time (interaction: β = -0.15, p = 0.004). Small hippocampal volume 
predicted a higher risk of clinical progression to AD (haard ratio [HR] = 2.15; 
confidence in terval [CI], 1.64-2.80; p < 0.001). A similar effect was not found 
for cortisol (HR = 1.206; CI, 0.82-1.37; p = 0.670) and there was no statistical 
evidence for an interaction between hippocampal volume and cortisol on clinical 
progression (HR = 0.81; CI, 0.57-0.17; p = 0.260).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that higher cortisol predicts higher 
hippocampal atrophy, which in turn is a risk factor for progression to AD. 
Regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through stress-reducing 
lifestyle interventions might be a protective factor against hippocampal 
degeneration at the prodromal stage of AD.

Registration is a core component of many imaging pipelines. In case of clinical 
scans, with lower resolution and sometimes substantial motion artifacts, 
registration can produce poor results. Visual assessment of registration quality 
in large clinical datasets is inefficient. In this work, we propose to 
automatically assess the quality of registration to an atlas in clinical FLAIR 
MRI scans of the brain. The method consists of automatically segmenting the 
ventricles of a given scan using a neural network, and comparing the 
segmentation to the atlas ventricles propagated to image space. We used the 
proposed method to improve clinical image registration to a general atlas by 
computing multiple registrations - one directly to the general atlas and others 
via different age-specific atlases - and then selecting the registration that 
yielded the highest ventricle overlap. Finally, as an example application of the 
complete pipeline, a voxelwise map of white matter hyperintensity burden was 
computed using only the scans with registration quality above a predefined 
threshold. Methods were evaluated in a single-site dataset of more than 1000 
scans, as well as a multi-center dataset comprising 142 clinical scans from 12 
sites. The automated ventricle segmentation reached a Dice coefficient with 
manual annotations of 0.89 in the single-site dataset, and 0.83 in the 
multi-center dataset. Registration via age-specific atlases could improve 
ventricle overlap compared to a direct registration to the general atlas (Dice 
similarity coefficient increase up to 0.15). Experiments also showed that 
selecting scans with the registration quality assessment method could improve 
the quality of average maps of white matter hyperintensity burden, instead of 
using all scans for the computation of the white matter hyperintensity map. In 
this work, we demonstrated the utility of an automated tool for assessing image 
registration quality in clinical scans. This image quality assessment step could 
ultimately assist in the translation of automated neuroimaging pipelines to the 
clinic.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic and fatal 
neurodegenerative disease with progressive impairment of memory. Brain 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been widely applied as 
important biomarkers of AD. Various machine learning approaches, especially deep 
learning-based models, have been proposed for the early diagnosis of AD and 
monitoring the disease progression on sMRI data. However, the requirement for a 
large number of training images still hinders the extensive usage of AD 
diagnosis. In addition, due to the similarities in human whole-brain structure, 
finding the subtle brain changes is essential to extract discriminative features 
from limited sMRI data effectively.
METHODS: In this work, we proposed two types of contrastive losses with paired 
sMRIs to promote the diagnostic performance using group categories (G-CAT) and 
varying subject mini-mental state examination (S-MMSE) information, 
respectively. Specifically, G-CAT contrastive loss layer was used to learn the 
closer feature representation from sMRIs with the same categories, while ranking 
information from S-MMSE assists the model to explore subtle changes between 
individuals.
RESULTS: The model was trained on ADNI-1. Comparison with baseline methods was 
performed on MIRIAD and ADNI-2. For the classification task on MIRIAD, S-MMSE 
achieves 93.5% of accuracy, 96.6% of sensitivity, and 94.9% of specificity, 
respectively. G-CAT and S-MMSE both reach remarkable performance in terms of 
classification sensitivity and specificity respectively. Comparing with 
state-of-the-art methods, we found this proposed method could achieve comparable 
results with other approaches.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model could extract discriminative features under 
whole-brain similarity. Extensive experiments also support the accuracy of this 
model, i.e., it provides better ability to identify uncertain samples, 
especially for the classification task of subjects with MMSE in 22-27. Source

When analyzing large multicenter databases, the effects of multiple confounding 
covariates increase the variability in the data and may reduce the ability to 
detect changes due to the actual effect of interest, for example, changes due to 
disease. Efficient ways to evaluate the effect of covariates toward the data 
harmonization are therefore important. In this article, we showcase techniques 
to assess the "goodness of harmonization" of covariates. We analyze 7,656 MR 
images in the multisite, multiscanner Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. We present a comparison of three methods for 
estimating total intracranial volume to assess their robustness and correct the 
brain structure volumes using the residual method and the proportional 
(normalization by division) method. We then evaluated the distribution of brain 
structure volumes over the entire ADNI database before and after accounting for 
multiple covariates such as total intracranial volume, scanner field strength, 
sex, and age using two techniques: (a) Zscapes, a panoramic visualization 
technique to analyze the entire database and (b) empirical cumulative 
distributions functions. The results from this study highlight the importance of 
assessing the goodness of data harmonization as a necessary preprocessing step 
when pooling large data set with multiple covariates, prior to further 
statistical data analysis.

BACKGROUND: Progression in Alzheimer's disease manifests as changes in multiple 
biomarker, cognitive, and functional endpoints. Disease progression modeling can 
be used to integrate these multiple measures into a synthesized metric of where 
a patient lies within the disease spectrum, allowing for a more dynamic measure 
over the range of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to combine modeling techniques from psychometric 
research (e.g., item response theory) and pharmacometrics (e.g., hierarchical 
models) to describe the multivariate longitudinal disease progression for 
patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we aimed to 
extend the subsequent model to make it suitable for clinical trial simulation, 
with the inclusion of covariates, to explain variability in latent progression 
(i.e., disease progression) and to aid in the assessment of enrichment 
strategies.
DESIGN: Multiple longitudinal endpoints in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative database were modeled. This model was validated internally using 
visual predictive checks, and externally by comparing data from the placebo arms 
of two Phase 2 crenezumab studies, ABBY (NCT01343966) and BLAZE (NCT01397578).
SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative began in 2004: the 
initial 5-year study (ADNI-1) was extended by 2 years in 2009 by a Grand 
Opportunities grant (ADNI-GO), and in 2011 and 2016 by further competitive 
renewals of the ADNI-1 grant (ADNI-2 and ADNI-3, respectively). This work 
studies natural progression data from patients with confirmed Alzheimer's 
disease. The Phase 2 ABBY and BLAZE trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
PARTICIPANTS: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, 305 
subjects who had a baseline diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease 
were included in modeling. From the ABBY and BLAZE studies, 158 patients were 
included from the studies' placebo arms.
MEASUREMENTS: Longitudinal cognitive and functional assessments modeled included 
the Clinical Dementia Rating (both as Sum of Boxes and individual item scores), 
the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - 
Cognitive Subscale, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Also included 
were the imaging variable fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and 
the following magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics: entorhinal, fusiform, 
hippocampal, intra-cranial, mid-temporal, ventricular, and whole brain.
RESULTS: Applying item response theory approaches in this longitudinal setting 
showed clinical assessments informing a common disease scale in the following 
order (from early disease to late disease): Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 
Functional Activities Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale 12, Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum 
of Boxes, and Mini-Mental State Examination. The Clinical Dementia Rating 
communication and home-and-hobbies items were most informative at earlier 
disease stages, while memory, orientation, and personal care informed the 
disease status at later stages. A clinical trial simulation model was developed 
and accurately described within-sample longitudinal distribution of endpoints. 
Simplifying the model to use only baseline age, MMSE, and APOEε4 status as 
predictors, out-of-sample mean progression of ADAS-Cog and CDR Sum of Boxes in 
the ABBY and BLAZE placebo arms was accurately described; however, the 
variability in these endpoints was underpredicted and suggests possibility for 
further model refinement when extrapolating from the ADNI sample to trial data. 
Clinical trial simulations were performed to exemplify use of the model to 
investigate hypothetical disease modification effects on the multivariate, 
longitudinal progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive 
Subscale and the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes.
CONCLUSIONS: The latent variable structure of item response theory can be 
extended to capture a variety of scales that are common assessments and 
indicators of disease status in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. These 
models are not intended to support causal inferences, but they do successfully 
characterize the observed correlation between endpoints over time and result in 
concise numerical indices of disease status that reflect the totality of 
evidence from considering the endpoints jointly. As such, the models have 
utility for a variety of tasks in clinical trial design, including simulation of 
hypothetical drug effects, interpolation of missing data, and assessment of 
in-sample information.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with many 
identifying biomarkers for diagnosis. However, whole-brain phenomena, 
particularly in functional MRI modalities, are not fully understood nor 
characterized. Here we employ the novel application of topological data analysis 
(TDA)-based methods of persistent homology to functional brain networks from 
ADNI-3 cohort to perform a subtyping experiment using unsupervised clustering 
techniques. We then investigate variations in QT-PAD challenge features across 
the identified clusters. Using a Wasserstein distance kernel with a variety of 
clustering algorithms, we found that the 0th-homology Wasserstein distance 
kernel and spectral clustering yielded clusters with significant differences in 
whole brain and medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume, thus demonstrating an 
intrinsic link between whole brain functional topology and brain morphometric 
structure. These findings demonstrate the importance of MTL in functional 
connectivity and the efficacy of using TDA-based machine learning methods in 
network neuroscience and neurodegenerative disease subtyping.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of accelerated MRI scans in 
place of non-accelerated scans influenced brain volume and atrophy rate measures 
in controls and subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. 
We used data from 861 subjects at baseline, 573 subjects at 6 months and 384 
subjects at 12 months from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). We calculated whole-brain, ventricular and hippocampal atrophy rates 
using the k-means boundary shift integral (BSI). Scan quality was visually 
assessed and the proportion of good quality accelerated and non-accelerated 
scans compared. We also compared MMSE scores, vascular burden and age between 
subjects with poor quality scans with those with good quality scans. Finally, we 
estimated sample size requirements for a hypothetical clinical trial when using 
atrophy rates from accelerated scans and non-accelerated scans. No significant 
differences in whole-brain, ventricular and hippocampal volumes and atrophy 
rates were found between accelerated and non-accelerated scans. Twice as many 
non-accelerated scan pairs suffered from at least some motion artefacts compared 
with accelerated scan pairs (p ≤ 0.001), which may influence the BSI. Subjects 
whose accelerated scans had significant motion had a higher mean vascular burden 
and age (p ≤ 0.05) whilst subjects whose non-accelerated scans had significant 
motion had poorer MMSE scores (p ≤ 0.05). No difference in estimated sample size 
requirements was found when using accelerated vs. non-accelerated scans. 
Accelerated scans reduce scan time and are better tolerated. Therefore it may be 
advantageous to use accelerated over non-accelerated scans in clinical trials 
that use ADNI-type protocols, especially in more cognitively impaired subjects.

Spatial-Temporal Dependency Modeling and Network Hub Detection for Functional 
MRI Analysis via Convolutional-Recurrent Network.

Wang M, Lian C, Yao D, Zhang D, Liu M, Shen D.

Early identification of dementia at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Although several pioneering studies have been devoted to automated AD diagnosis 
based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their 
performance is somewhat limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal 
dependency. Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit 
detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that 
are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique 
Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated 
prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. 
Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related 
hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first 
partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A 
sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the 
local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based 
on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their 
unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long 
short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain 
temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus 
capturing the temporal dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 
174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our 
method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and AD-related hub 
detection.

BACKGROUND: Both amyloid (Aβ) load and APOE4 allele are associated with 
neurodegenerative changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prone regions and with 
risk for cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the unique and independent contribution of APOE4 allele 
status (E4+∖E4-), Aβ status (Amy+∖Amy-), and combined APOE4 and Aβ status on 
regional cortical thickness (CoTh) and cognition among participants diagnosed as 
cognitively normal (CN, n = 251), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, 
n = 207), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI, n = 196), and mild AD (n = 162) 
from the ADNI.
METHODS: A series of two-way ANCOVAs with post-hoc Tukey HSD tests, controlling 
independently for Aβ and APOE4 status and age were examined.
RESULTS: Among LMCI and AD participants, cortical thinning was widespread in 
association with Amy+ status, whereas in association with E4+ status only in the 
inferior temporal and medial orbito-frontal regions. Among CN and EMCI 
participants, E4+ status, but not Amy+ status, was independently associated with 
increased CoTh, especially in limbic regions [e.g., in the entorhinal cortex, 
CoTh was 0.123 mm greater (p = 0.002) among E4+ than E4-participants]. Among CN 
and EMCI, both E4+ and Amy+ status were independently associated with cognitive 
impairment, which was greatest among those with combined E4 + and Amy+ status.
CONCLUSION: Decreased CoTh is independently associated with Amy+ status in many 
brain regions, but with E4+ status in very restricted number of brain regions. 
Among CN and EMCI participants, E4 + status is associated with increased CoTh, 
in medial and inferior temporal regions, although cognitive impairment at this 
state is independently associated with Amy+ and E4 + status. These findings 
imply a unique pathophysiological mechanism for E4 + status in AD and its 
progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that usually 
starts slowly and progressively worsens. Predicting the progression of 
Alzheimer's disease with longitudinal analysis on the time series data has 
recently received increasing attention. However, training an accurate 
progression model for brain network faces two major challenges: missing 
features, and the small sample size during the follow-up study. According to our 
analysis on the AD progression task, we thoroughly analyze the correlation among 
the multiple predictive tasks of AD progression at multiple time points. Thus, 
we propose a multi-task learning framework that can adaptively impute missing 
values and predict future progression over time from a subject's historical 
measurements. Progression is measured in terms of MRI volumetric measurements, 
trajectories of a cognitive score and clinical status. To this end, we propose a 
new perspective of predicting the AD progression with a multi-task learning 
paradigm. In our multi-task learning paradigm, we hypothesize that the inherent 
correlations exist among: (i). the prediction tasks of clinical diagnosis, 
cognition and ventricular volume at each time point; (ii). the tasks of 
imputation and prediction; and (iii). the prediction tasks at multiple future 
time points. According to our findings of the task correlation, we develop an 
end-to-end deep multi-task learning method to jointly improve the performance of 
assigning missing value and prediction. We design a balanced multi-task dynamic 
weight optimization. With in-depth analysis and empirical evidence on 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we show the benefits and 
flexibility of the proposed multi-task learning model, especially for the 
prediction at the M60 time point. The proposed approach achieves 5.6%, 5.7%, 
4.0% and 11.8% improvement with respect to mAUC, BCA and MAE (ADAS-Cog13 and 
Ventricles), respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether APOE ε4 carriers have higher hippocampal 
atrophy rates than non-carriers in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and controls, and if so, whether higher hippocampal atrophy 
rates are still observed after adjusting for concurrent whole-brain atrophy 
rates.
METHODS: MRI scans from all available visits in ADNI (148 AD, 307 MCI, 167 
controls) were used. MCI subjects were divided into "progressors" (MCI-P) if 
diagnosed with AD within 36 months or "stable" (MCI-S) if a diagnosis of MCI was 
maintained. A joint multi-level mixed-effect linear regression model was used to 
analyse the effect of ε4 carrier-status on hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy 
rates, adjusting for age, gender, MMSE and brain-to-intracranial volume ratio. 
The difference in hippocampal rates between ε4 carriers and non-carriers after 
adjustment for concurrent whole-brain atrophy rate was then calculated.
RESULTS: Mean adjusted hippocampal atrophy rates in ε4 carriers were 
significantly higher in AD, MCI-P and MCI-S (p≤0.011, all tests) compared with 
ε4 non-carriers. After adjustment for whole-brain atrophy rate, the difference 
in mean adjusted hippocampal atrophy rate between ε4 carriers and non-carriers 
was reduced but remained statistically significant in AD and MCI-P.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the APOE ε4 allele drives atrophy to the 
medial-temporal lobe region in AD.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear how brain reserve interacts with gender and 
apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype, and how this influences the progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between intracranial volume (ICV) and 
progression to AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
differences according to gender and APOE4 genotype, was investigated.
METHODS: Data from subjects initially diagnosed with MCI and at least two visits 
were downloaded from the ADNI database. Those who progressed to AD were defined 
as converters. The longitudinal influence of ICV was determined by survival 
analysis. The time of conversion from MCI to AD was set as a fiducial point, as 
all converters would be at a similar disease stage then, and longitudinal 
trajectories of brain atrophy and cognitive decline around that point were 
compared using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Large ICV increased the risk of conversion to AD in males (HR: 4.24, 
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-15.40) and APOE4 non-carriers (HR: 10.00, 95% 
CI: 1.34-74.53), but not in females or APOE4 carriers. Cognitive decline and 
brain atrophy progressed at a faster rate in males with large ICV than in those 
with small ICV during the two years before and after the time of conversion.
CONCLUSIONS: Large ICV increased the risk of conversion to AD in males and APOE4 
non-carriers with MCI. This may be due to its influence on disease trajectory, 
which shortens the duration of the MCI stage. A longitudinal model of 
progression trajectory is proposed.

BACKGROUND: Large-scale neuronal network breakdown underlies memory impairment 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the differential trajectories of the 
relationships between network organisation and memory across pathology and 
cognitive stages in AD remain elusive. We determined whether and how the 
influences of individual-level structural and metabolic covariance network 
integrity on memory varied with amyloid pathology across clinical stages without 
assuming a constant relationship.
METHODS: Seven hundred and eight participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative were studied. Individual-level structural and metabolic 
covariance scores in higher-level cognitive and hippocampal networks were 
derived from magnetic resonance imaging and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography using seed-based partial least square analyses. The 
non-linear associations between network scores and memory across cognitive 
stages in each pathology group were examined using sparse varying coefficient 
modelling.
RESULTS: We showed that the associations of memory with structural and metabolic 
networks in the hippocampal and default mode regions exhibited 
pathology-dependent differential trajectories across cognitive stages using 
sparse varying coefficient modelling. In amyloid pathology group, there was an 
early influence of hippocampal structural network deterioration on memory 
impairment in the preclinical stage, and a biphasic influence of the angular 
gyrus-seeded default mode metabolic network on memory in both preclinical and 
dementia stages. In non-amyloid pathology groups, in contrast, the trajectory of 
the hippocampus-memory association was opposite and weaker overall, while no 
metabolism covariance networks were related to memory. Key findings were 
replicated in a larger cohort of 1280 participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight potential windows of early intervention 
targeting network breakdown at the preclinical AD stage.

Higher body mass index (BMI) in late-life has recently been considered as a 
possible protective factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which yet remains 
conflicting. To test this hypothesis, we have evaluated the cross-sectional and 
longitudinal associations of BMI categories with CSF biomarkers, brain β-amyloid 
(Aβ) load, brain structure, and cognition and have assessed the effect of 
late-life BMI on AD risk in a large sample (n = 1,212) of non-demented elderly 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. At 
baseline, higher late-life BMI categories were associated with higher levels of 
CSF Aβ42 (p=0.037), lower levels of CSF total-tau (t-tau, p=0.026) and CSF 
t-tau/Aβ42 (p=0.008), lower load of Aβ in the right hippocampus (p=0.030), as 
well as larger volumes of hippocampus (p<0.0001), entorhinal cortex (p=0.009) 
and middle temporal lobe (p=0.040). But no association was found with CSF 
phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) or CSF p-tau/Aβ42. Longitudinal studies showed that 
higher BMI individuals experienced a slower decline in cognitive function. In 
addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that higher late-life BMI had 
a reduced risk of progression to AD over time (p = 0.009). Higher BMI in 
late-life decreased the risk of AD, and this process may be driven by AD-related 
biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two 
proteinopathies, amyloid and tau, which have a cascading effect on the 
functional and structural organization of the brain.
METHODS: In this study, we used a supervised machine learning technique to build 
a model of functional connections that predicts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
p-tau/Aβ42 (the PATH-fc model). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) data from 289 older adults in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were utilized for this model.
RESULTS: We successfully derived the PATH-fc model to predict the ratio of 
p-tau/Aβ42 as well as cognitive functioning in older adults across the spectrum 
of healthy and pathological aging. However, the in-sample fit magnitude was low, 
indicating a need for further model development.
DISCUSSION: Our pathology-based model of functional connectivity included 
representation from multiple canonical networks of the brain with intra-network 
connectivity associated with low pathology and inter-network connectivity 
associated with higher levels of pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Whole-brain functional connectivity model (PATH-fc) is linked to AD 
pathophysiology. The PATH-fc model predicts performance in multiple domains of 
cognitive functioning. The PATH-fc model is a distributed model including 
representation from all canonical networks.

INTRODUCTION: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-like transcript 2 
gene (TREML2) is a newly identified AD susceptibility gene. Its missense variant 
rs3747742-C substantially decreases AD risk in both Caucasians and Han Chinese, 
but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, to uncover 
the possible mechanisms by which TREML2 rs3747742-C reduces AD risk, we 
investigated the possible relation of this variant with AD-related brain 
structures using a cognitively normal elderly population from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
METHODS: In total, 158 cognitively normal elders from ADNI database with 
complete data for brain structures and TREML2 rs3747742 genotype were included 
in this study. The association of TREML2 rs3747742 genotype with the structures 
of three cerebral cortices (entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and 
parahippocampal gyrus), two subcortical regions (amygdala and hippocampus), and 
three subfields of hippocampus (CA1, CA2 + CA3, and CA4 + dentate gyrus) was 
investigated.
RESULTS: A significant difference was noted in the volume of right CA1 subfield 
among three genotypes of TREML2 rs3747742 (p = .0364). In the multivariate 
analysis, TREML2 rs3747742-C significantly increased right CA1 subfield volume 
after adjusting for age, gender, education years, APOE ε4 status, and 
intracranial volume under the recessive genetic model (Bonferroni corrected 
p = .003586).
CONCLUSION: The present study provides the first evidence that TREML2 
rs3747742-C carriers have larger volumes of hippocampal CA1 subfield in a 
cognitively normal elderly population. These findings imply that enhancement of 
brain reserve may contribute to the protection of TREML2 rs3747742-C in AD 
susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD) is associated with an 
elevated risk of cognitive impairment in non-demented older adults. Given that 
hippocampal and middle temporal gyrus atrophy have been shown to cause SSD, our 
study aimed to investigate the effect of hippocampal volume on the association 
between SSD and cognitive impairment.
METHODS: 338 non-demented older adults from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative) cohort who underwent cognitive assessments, 
questionnaires on depressive symptoms and MRI brain were studied. SSD group is 
defined as a score of 1-5 based on Geriatric Depression Scale scores. We 
conducted causal mediation analyses to investigate the effect of hippocampal 
volume on cognitive performance cross-sectionally.
RESULTS: The SSD group displayed lower left and right hippocampal volume 
(p<0.01) than the non-SSD group. SSD was linked to poorer cognition and smaller 
hippocampal volume. We found that hippocampal volume partially mediated the 
effect of SSD on cognitive performance including the global cognition and the 
cognitive section of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, with mediation 
percentages ranging from 6.45 % to 30.46 %. In addition, we found that the 
thickness of the left middle temporal, right entorhinal and right fusiform 
gyrus, brain regions linked to AD, mediate the relationship between SSD and 
cognition with mediation percentages ranging from 8.67 % to 21.44 %.
LIMITATIONS: Our article didn't differentiate between mild cognitive impairment 
and normal population.
CONCLUSION: The associations of SSD and cognitive impairment are linked to 
alterations in Alzheimer's Disease related brain regions.

Mild cognitive Impairment (MCI) is notoriously heterogenous in terms of clinical 
presentation, neuroimaging correlates, and subsequent progression. Predicting 
who will progress to dementia, which type of dementia, and over what timeframe 
is challenging. Previous work has attempted to identify MCI subtypes using 
neuropsychological measures in an effort to address this challenge; however, 
there is no consensus on approach, which may account for some of the 
variability. Using a hierarchical community detection approach, we examined 
cognitive subtypes within an MCI sample (from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI] study). We then examined whether these subtypes 
were related to biomarkers (e.g., cortical volumes, fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) hypometabolism) or clinical 
progression. We identified five communities (i.e., cognitive subtypes) within 
the MCI sample: 1) predominantly memory impairment, 2) predominantly language 
impairment, 3) cognitively normal, 4) multidomain, with notable executive 
dysfunction, 5) multidomain, with notable processing speed impairment. Community 
membership was significantly associated with 1) cortical volume in the 
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fusiform cortex; 2) FDG PET hypometabolism 
in the posterior cingulate, angular gyrus, and inferior/middle temporal gyrus; 
and 3) conversion to dementia at follow up. Overall, community detection as an 
approach appears a viable method for identifying unique cognitive subtypes in a 
neurodegenerative sample that were linked to several meaningful biomarkers and 
modestly with progression at one year follow up.

RLAD: A Reliable Hippo-guided Multi-task Model for Alzheimer's Disease 
Diagnosis.

Lei Z, Zhu W, Liu J, Hua C, Li J, Shah SAA, Zhang L, Bennamoun M, Mao C.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for its prevention, and 
hippocampal atrophy is a significant lesion for early diagnosis. The current 
DL-based AD diagnosis methods only focus on either AD classification or 
hippocampus segmentation independently, neglecting the correlation between the 
two tasks and lacking pathological interpretability. To address this issue, we 
propose a Reliable Hippo-guided Learning model for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis 
(RLAD), which employs multi-task learning for AD classification as a main task 
supplemented by hippocampus segmentation. More specifically, our model consists 
of 1) a hybrid shared features encoder that encodes local and global information 
in MRI to enhance the model's ability to learn discriminative features; 2) Task 
Specific Decoders to accomplish AD classification and hippocampus segmentation; 
and 3) Task Coordination module to correlate the two tasks and guide the 
classification task to focus on the hippocampus area. Our proposed RLAD model is 
evaluated on MRI scans of 1631 subjects from three independent datasets, 
including ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and HarP. Our extensive experimental results 
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves the performance of AD 
classification and hippocampus segmentation with strong generalization 
capabilities. Our implementation and model are available at 
https://github.com/LeoLjl/Explainable-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: The cognitive decline induced by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely 
related to changes in hippocampal structure captured by magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). To accurately analyze the morphological changes of the 
hippocampus induced by AD, it is necessary to establish a one-to-one surface 
correspondence to compare the morphological measurements across different 
hippocampal surfaces. However, most existing landmark-based registration methods 
cannot satisfy both landmark matching and diffeomorphism under large 
deformations. To address these challenges, we propose a landmark-based spherical 
registration method via quasi-conformal mapping to establish a one-to-one 
correspondence between different hippocampal surfaces.
METHODS: In our approach, we use the eigen-graph of the hippocampal surface to 
extract the intrinsic and unified landmarks of all the hippocampal surfaces and 
then realize the parameterization process from the hippocampal surface to a unit 
sphere according to the barycentric coordinate theory and the triangular mesh 
optimization algorithm. Finally, through the local stereographic projection, the 
alignment of the landmarks is achieved based on the quasi-conformal mapping on a 
two-dimensional (2D) plane under the constraints of Beltrami coefficients which 
can effectively control the topology distortion.
RESULTS: We verified the proposed registration method on real hippocampus data 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and created 
AD and normal control (NC) groups. Our registration algorithm achieved an area 
distortion index (ADI) of 0.4362e-4±0.7800e-5 in the AD group and 
0.5671e-4±0.602e-5 in the NC group, and it achieved an angle distortion index 
(Eangle) of 0.6407±0.0258 in the AD group and 0.6271±0.0194 in the NC group. The 
accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) classification for the AD vs. NC groups 
based on the morphological features extracted from the registered hippocampal 
surfaces reached 94.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: This landmark-based spherical quasi-conformal mapping for 
hippocampal surface registration algorithm can maintain precise alignment of the 
landmarks and bijectivity in the presence of large deformation.

INTRODUCTION: Impaired self-awareness of memory function, a.k.a. anosognosia, is 
a common symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, its pathological 
correlates remain unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of amyloid and tau 
on memory self-awareness.
METHODS: Two hundred thirty-six clinically normal (N) and 102 impaired (I) 
participants from the ADNI cohort were included. Amyloid (global) and tau burden 
(in entorhinal and inferior temporal cortices) were assessed using positron 
emission tomography (PET). Self-awareness of memory was assessed using 
discrepancy indexes of subjective participant-informant ratings, as well as 
participant-objective scores of memory performance. Subjective and objective 
values were derived from the Everyday Cognition memory questionnaire and Logical 
Memory (delayed recall).
RESULTS: Lower awareness (both methods) of memory function was associated with 
higher levels of pathology in the I group as compared to N. There was a 
significant effect of tauopathy, but not amyloidosis, on individual complaint, 
such that higher levels of tau associated with lower awareness.
DISCUSSION: Impaired self-awareness appears progressively in the evolution of 
the disease related to AD biomarkers. Discordant subjective and objective 
measures may be important for clinical consideration.

Adult neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus during 
adulthood and contributes to sustaining the hippocampal formation. To 
investigate whether neurogenesis-related pathways are associated with 
hippocampal volume, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis using summary 
statistics from a large-scale genome-wide association study (N = 13,163) of 
hippocampal volume from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through 
Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium and two year hippocampal volume changes from 
baseline in cognitively normal individuals from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative Cohort (ADNI). Gene-set enrichment analysis of hippocampal volume 
identified 44 significantly enriched biological pathways (FDR corrected 
p-value < 0.05), of which 38 pathways were related to neurogenesis-related 
processes including neurogenesis, generation of new neurons, neuronal 
development, and neuronal migration and differentiation. For genes highly 
represented in the significantly enriched neurogenesis-related pathways, 
gene-based association analysis identified TESC, ACVR1, MSRB3, and DPP4 as 
significantly associated with hippocampal volume. Furthermore, co-expression 
network-based functional analysis of gene expression data in the hippocampal 
subfields, CA1 and CA3, from 32 normal controls showed that distinct 
co-expression modules were mostly enriched in neurogenesis related pathways. Our 
results suggest that neurogenesis-related pathways may be enriched for 
hippocampal volume and that hippocampal volume may serve as a potential 
phenotype for the investigation of human adult neurogenesis.

The lack of strong association between brain beta-amyloid deposition and 
cognitive impairment has been a challenge for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
field. Although beta-amyloid is necessary for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, it 
is not sufficient to make the pathologic diagnosis or cause dementia. We sought 
to identify the genetic modifiers of the relation between cortical beta-amyloid 
burden (measured using [18F]Florbetapir-PET) and cognitive dysfunction (measured 
using ADAS-cog) by conducting a genome-wide interaction study on baseline data 
from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
phases GO/2 (n=678). Near genome-wide significant interaction effect was 
observed for rs73069071 within the IAPP (amylin) and SLCO1A2 genes (P=6.2 × 
10-8). Congruent results were found using data from participants followed up 
from ADNI-1 (Pone-tailed=0.028, n=165). Meta-analysis across ADNI-GO/2 and 
ADNI-1 revealed a genome-wide significant interaction effect (P=1.1 × 10-8). Our 
results were further supported by similar interaction effects on temporal lobe 
cortical thickness (whole-brain voxelwise analysis: familywise error corrected 
P=0.013) and longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog score and left middle temporal 
thickness and amygdalar volume (Pone-tailed=0.026, 0.019 and 0.003, 
respectively). Using postmortem beta-amyloid immunohistochemistry data from 243 
AD participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, we 
also observed similar rs73069071-by-beta-amyloid deposition interaction effect 
on global cognitive function (Pone-tailed=0.005). Our findings provide insight 
into the complexity of the relationship between beta-amyloid burden and 
AD-related cognitive impairment. Although functional studies are required to 
elucidate the role of rs73069071 in AD pathophysiology, our results support the 
recently growing evidence on the role of amylin in AD.

Studies have shown that women on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have 
more pathological tau in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), than men. Some 
studies have found that higher levels of tau biomarkers are more strongly 
associated with clinical AD, cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in women 
than in men. Despite major developments in the use of plasma tau phosphorylated 
at threonine 181 (p-tau181) as an AD biomarker, it is unknown whether these sex 
differences apply to plasma p-tau181. In 1060 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) participants (47% women, 73.8 ± 7.6 years old), we examined 
sex differences in plasma p-tau181 levels and their association with other 
biomarkers, cognitive decline and incident AD. Linear regressions tested for an 
effect of sex on plasma p-tau181 levels and for plasma p-tau181 × sex 
interactions on CSF p-tau181, as well as entorhinal cortex tau, cortical 
amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and brain glucose metabolism, quantified using PET 
imaging. Linear mixed effects models tested for a sex × baseline plasma p-tau181 
interaction on change in cognition over time. Finally, Cox models tested for a 
sex × plasma p-tau181 interaction on the risk of AD dementia in participants who 
were free of dementia at baseline. Despite similar plasma p-tau181 levels 
between sexes, women had lower brain glucose metabolism, greater brain Aβ and 
entorhinal cortex tau deposition, higher CSF p-tau181 and faster cognitive 
decline in relation to higher baseline plasma p-tau181 levels compared with men. 
Among Aβ positive, dementia-free participants, women had higher rates of 
incident AD dementia associated with increasing baseline plasma p-tau181 levels, 
relative to men. Our results suggest that sex may impact the clinical 
interpretation of plasma p-tau181 concentrations. If replicated, these findings 
could have important implications for the use of plasma p-tau181 as an 
accessible AD biomarker and screening tool for preventive and therapeutic 
clinical trials.

This article investigates late-onset cognitive impairment using neuroimaging and 
genetics biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
participants. Eight-hundred and eight ADNI subjects were identified and divided 
into three groups: 200 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 383 subjects with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 225 asymptomatic normal controls (NC). 
Their structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were parcellated using 
BrainParser, and the 80 most important neuroimaging biomarkers were extracted 
using the global shape analysis Pipeline workflow. Using Plink via the Pipeline 
environment, we obtained 80 SNPs highly-associated with the imaging biomarkers. 
In the AD cohort, rs2137962 was significantly associated bilaterally with 
changes in the hippocampi and the parahippocampal gyri, and rs1498853, rs288503, 
and rs288496 were associated with the left and right hippocampi, the right 
parahippocampal gyrus, and the left inferior temporal gyrus. In the MCI cohort, 
rs17028008 and rs17027976 were significantly associated with the right caudate 
and right fusiform gyrus, rs2075650 (TOMM40) was associated with the right 
caudate, and rs1334496 and rs4829605 were significantly associated with the 
right inferior temporal gyrus. In the NC cohort, Chromosome 15 [rs734854 
(STOML1), rs11072463 (PML), rs4886844 (PML), and rs1052242 (PML)] was 
significantly associated with both hippocampi and both insular cortices, and 
rs4899412 (RGS6) was significantly associated with the caudate. We observed 
significant correlations between genetic and neuroimaging phenotypes in the 808 
ADNI subjects. These results suggest that differences between AD, MCI, and NC 
cohorts may be examined by using powerful joint models of morphometric, imaging 
and genotypic data.

There is well-documented evidence of brain network differences between 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC). To date, 
imaging studies investigating brain networks in these populations have typically 
been cross-sectional, and the reproducibility of such findings is somewhat 
unclear. In a novel study, we use the longitudinal ADNI data on the whole brain 
to jointly compute the brain network at baseline and one-year using a state of 
the art approach that pools information across both time points to yield 
distinct visit-specific networks for the AD and HC cohorts, resulting in more 
accurate inferences. We perform a multiscale comparison of the AD and HC 
networks in terms of global network metrics as well as at the more granular 
level of resting state networks defined under a whole brain parcellation. Our 
analysis illustrates a decrease in small-worldedness in the AD group at both the 
time points and also identifies more local network features and hub nodes that 
are disrupted due to the progression of AD. We also obtain high reproducibility 
of the HC network across visits. On the other hand, a separate estimation of the 
networks at each visit using standard graphical approaches reveals fewer 
meaningful differences and lower reproducibility.

CA1 subfield and subiculum of the hippocampus contain a series of dentate 
bulges, which are also called hippocampus dentation (HD). There have been 
several studies demonstrating an association between HD and brain disorders. 
Such as the number of hippocampal dentation correlates with temporal lobe 
epilepsy. And epileptic hippocampus have a lower number of dentation compared to 
contralateral hippocampus. However, most studies rely on subjective assessment 
by manual searching and counting in HD areas, which is time-consuming and 
labor-intensive to process large amounts of samples. And to date, only one 
objective method for quantifying HD has been proposed. Therefore, to fill this 
gap, we developed an automated and objective method to quantify HD and explore 
its relationship with neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we performed a 
fine-scale morphological characterization of HD in 2911 subjects from four 
different cohorts of ADNI, PPMI, HCP, and IXI to quantify and explore 
differences between them in MR T1w images. The results showed that the degree of 
right hippocampal dentation are lower in patients with Alzheimer's disease than 
samples in mild cognitive impairment or cognitively normal, whereas this change 
is not significant in Parkinson's disease progression. The innovation of this 
paper that we propose a quantitative, robust, and fully automated method. These 
methodological innovation and corresponding results delineated above constitute 
the significance and novelty of our study. What's more, the proposed method 
breaks through the limitations of manual labeling and is the first to 
quantitatively measure and compare HD in four different brain populations 
including thousands of subjects. These findings revealed new morphological 
patterns in the hippocampal dentation, which can help with subsequent fine-scale 
hippocampal morphology research.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder 
characterized by mild memory loss and ranks as a leading cause of mortality in 
the USA, accounting for approximately 120,000 deaths per year. It is also the 
primary form of dementia. Early detection is critical for timely intervention as 
the neurodegenerative process often starts 15-20 years before cognitive symptoms 
manifest. This study focuses on determining feature importance in AD 
classification using fused texture features from 3D magnetic resonance imaging 
hippocampal and entorhinal cortex and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) 
derived from positron emission tomography (PET) images.
METHODS: To achieve this objective, we employed four distinct classifiers 
(Linear Support Vector Classification, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic 
Regression, and Logistic Regression Classifier with Stochastic Gradient Descent 
Learning). These classifiers were used to derive both average and top-ranked 
importance scores for each feature based on their outputs. Our framework is 
designed to distinguish between two classes, AD-negative (or mild cognitive 
impairment stable [MCIs]) and AD-positive (or MCI conversion [MCIc]), using a 
probabilistic neural network classifier and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database.
RESULTS: The findings from the feature importance highlight the crucial role of 
the GLCM texture features extracted from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, 
demonstrating their superior performance compared to the volume and SUVR. GLCM 
texture AD classification achieved approximately 90% sensitivity in identifying 
MCIc cases while maintaining low false positives (below 30%) when fused with 
other features. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic curves validate 
the GLCMs' superior performance in distinguishing between MCIs and MCIc. 
Additionally, fusing different types of features improved classification 
performance compared to relying solely on any single feature category.
CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the pivotal role of GLCM texture features in 
early Alzheimer's detection.

Dual Attention Multi-Instance Deep Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis 
With Structural MRI.

Zhu W, Sun L, Huang J, Han L, Zhang D.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is widely used for the brain 
neurological disease diagnosis, which could reflect the variations of brain. 
However, due to the local brain atrophy, only a few regions in sMRI scans have 
obvious structural changes, which are highly correlative with pathological 
features. Hence, the key challenge of sMRI-based brain disease diagnosis is to 
enhance the identification of discriminative features. To address this issue, we 
propose a dual attention multi-instance deep learning network (DA-MIDL) for the 
early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Specifically, DA-MIDL consists of three primary 
components: 1) the Patch-Nets with spatial attention blocks for extracting 
discriminative features within each sMRI patch whilst enhancing the features of 
abnormally changed micro-structures in the cerebrum, 2) an attention 
multi-instance learning (MIL) pooling operation for balancing the relative 
contribution of each patch and yield a global different weighted representation 
for the whole brain structure, and 3) an attention-aware global classifier for 
further learning the integral features and making the AD-related classification 
decisions. Our proposed DA-MIDL model is evaluated on the baseline sMRI scans of 
1689 subjects from two independent datasets (i.e., ADNI and AIBL). The 
experimental results show that our DA-MIDL model can identify discriminative 
pathological locations and achieve better classification performance in terms of 
accuracy and generalizability, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

BACKGROUND: We propose a classification method for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
based on the texture of the hippocampus, which is the organ that is most 
affected by the onset of AD.
METHODS: We obtained magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of Alzheimer's patients 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. This 
dataset consists of image data for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
normal controls (NCs), classified according to the cognitive condition. In this 
study, the research methods included image processing, texture analyses, and 
deep learning. Firstly, images were acquired for texture analyses, which were 
then re-spaced, registered, and cropped with Gabor filters applied to the 
resulting image data. In the texture analyses, we applied the 3-dimensional (3D) 
gray-level co-occurrence (GLCM) method to evaluate the textural features of the 
image, and used Fisher's coefficient to select the appropriate features for 
classification. In the last stage, we implemented a deep learning multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP) model, which we divided into three types, namely, AD-MCI, 
AD-NC, and MCI-NC.
RESULTS: We used this model to assess the accuracy of the proposed method. The 
classification accuracy of the proposed deep learning model was confirmed in the 
cases of AD-MCI (72.5%), ADNC (85%), and MCI-NC (75%). We also evaluated the 
results obtained using a confusion matrix, support vector machine (SVM), and 
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and analyzed the results to objectively 
verify our model. We obtained the highest accuracy of 85% in the AD-NC.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model was at least 6-19% more accurate than the SVM and 
KNN classifiers, respectively. Hence, this study confirms the validity and 
superiority of the proposed method, which can be used as a diagnostic tool for 
early Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated 
with reduction in hippocampal volume in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
However, it is unknown whether hippocampal texture changes in persons with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) that does not have a change in hippocampal volume. We 
tested the hypothesis that hippocampal texture has association to early 
cognitive loss beyond that of volumetric changes. The texture marker was trained 
and evaluated using T1-weighted MRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and subsequently applied to score 
independent data sets from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle 
Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) and the Metropolit 1953 Danish Male Birth Cohort 
(Metropolit). Hippocampal texture was superior to volume reduction as predictor 
of MCI-to-AD conversion in ADNI (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve [AUC] 0.74 vs. 0.67; DeLong test, p = 0.005), and provided 
even better prognostic results in AIBL (AUC 0.83). Hippocampal texture, but not 
volume, correlated with Addenbrooke's cognitive examination score (Pearson 
correlation, r = -0.25, p < 0.001) in the Metropolit cohort. The hippocampal 
texture marker correlated with hippocampal glucose metabolism as indicated by 
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (Pearson correlation, r = -0.57, 
p < 0.001). Texture statistics remained significant after adjustment for volume 
in all cases, and the combination of texture and volume did not improve 
diagnostic or prognostic AUCs significantly. Our study highlights the presence 
of hippocampal texture abnormalities in MCI, and the possibility that texture 
may serve as a prognostic neuroimaging biomarker of early cognitive impairment.

The prediction of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will 
progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically relevant, and may above all 
have a significant impact on accelerating the development of new treatments. In 
this paper, we present a new MRI-based biomarker that enables us to accurately 
predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD. In order to better capture the AD 
signature, we introduce two main contributions. First, we present a new 
graph-based grading framework to combine inter-subject similarity features and 
intra-subject variability features. This framework involves patch-based grading 
of anatomical structures and graph-based modeling of structure alteration 
relationships. Second, we propose an innovative multiscale brain analysis to 
capture alterations caused by AD at different anatomical levels. Based on a 
cascade of classifiers, this multiscale approach enables the analysis of 
alterations of whole brain structures and hippocampus subfields at the same 
time. During our experiments using the ADNI-1 dataset, the proposed multiscale 
graph-based grading method obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 81% to 
predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD within three years. Moreover, when 
combined with cognitive scores, the proposed method obtained 85% of AUC. These 
results are competitive in comparison to state-of-the-art methods evaluated on 
the same dataset.

NFL players, by virtue of their exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI), are at 
higher risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) than the general 
population. Early recognition and intervention before the onset of clinical 
symptoms could potentially avert/delay the long-term consequences of these 
diseases. Given that AD is thought to have a long pre-clinical incubation 
period, the aim of the current research was to determine whether former NFL 
players show evidence of incipient dementia in their structural imaging before 
diagnosis of AD. To identify neuroimaging markers of AD, against which former 
NFL players would be compared, we conducted a whole-brain volumetric analysis 
using a cohort of AD patients (ADNI clinical database) to produce a set of brain 
regions demonstrating sensitivity to early AD pathology (i.e., the "AD 
fingerprint"). A group of 46 former NFL players' brain magnetic resonance images 
were then interrogated using the AD fingerprint, that is, the former NFL 
subjects were compared volumetrically to AD patients using a T1-weighted 
magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence. The FreeSurfer image 
analysis suite (version 6.0) was used to obtain volumetric and cortical 
thickness data. The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric-Version 4 was 
used to assess current cognitive functioning. A total of 55 brain regions 
demonstrated significant atrophy or ex vacuo dilatation bilaterally in AD 
patients versus controls. Of the 46 former NFL players, 41% demonstrated a 
greater than expected number of atrophied/dilated AD regions compared with 
age-matched controls, presumably reflecting AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: Financial capacity is often one of the first instrumental activities 
of daily living to be affected in cognitively normal (CN) older adults who later 
progress to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association 
between financial capacity and regional cerebral tau.
METHODS: Cross-sectional financial capacity was assessed using the Financial 
Capacity Instrument -Short Form (FCI-SF) in 410 CN, 199 MCI, and 61 AD dementia 
participants who underwent flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Linear regression models 
with backward elimination were used with FCI-SF total score as the dependent 
variable and regional tau and tau-amyloid interaction as predictors of interest 
in separate analyses. Education, age, sex, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
Total Learning, and Trail Making Test B were used as covariates.
RESULTS: Significant associations were found between FCI-SF and tau regions 
(entorhinal: p < 0.001; inferior temporal: p < 0.001; dorsolateral prefrontal: 
p = 0.01; posterior cingulate: p = 0.03; precuneus: p < 0.001; and supramarginal 
gyrus: p = 0.005) across all participants. For the tau-amyloid interaction, 
significant associations were found in four regions (amyloid and dorsolateral 
prefrontal tau interaction: p = 0.005; amyloid and posterior cingulate tau 
interaction: p = 0.005; amyloid and precuneus tau interaction: p < 0.001; and 
amyloid and supramarginal tau interaction: p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Greater regional tau burden was modestly associated with financial 
capacity impairment in early-stage AD. Extending this work with longitudinal 
analyses will further illustrate the utility of such assessments in detecting 
clinically meaningful decline, which may aid clinical trials of early-stage AD.

Dynamic changes in the brain's lateral ventricles on magnetic resonance imaging 
are powerful biomarkers of disease progression in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ventricular measures can represent 
accumulation of diffuse brain atrophy with very high effect sizes. Despite 
having no direct role in cognition, ventricular expansion co-occurs with 
volumetric loss in gray and white matter structures. To better understand 
relationships between ventricular and cortical changes over time, we related 
ventricular expansion to atrophy in cognitively relevant cortical gray matter 
surfaces, which are more challenging to segment. In ADNI participants, percent 
change in ventricular volumes at 1-year (N = 677) and 2-year (N = 536) intervals 
was significantly associated with baseline cortical thickness and volume in the 
full sample controlling for age, sex, and diagnosis, and in MCI separately. 
Ventricular expansion in MCI was associated with thinner gray matter in frontal, 
temporal, and parietal regions affected by AD. Ventricular expansion reflects 
cortical atrophy in early AD, offering a useful biomarker for clinical trials of 
interventions to slow AD progression.

The growing public threat of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised the urgency to 
discover and validate prognostic biomarkers in order to predicting time to onset 
of AD. It is anticipated that both whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) data and high dimensional whole brain imaging data offer predictive values 
to identify subjects at risk for progressing to AD. The aim of this paper is to 
test whether both whole genome SNP data and whole brain imaging data offer 
predictive values to identify subjects at risk for progressing to AD. In 343 
subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), we extracted high dimensional MR 
imaging (volumetric data on 93 brain regions plus a surface fluid registration 
based hippocampal subregion and surface data), and whole genome data (504,095 
SNPs from GWAS), as well as routine neurocognitive and clinical data at 
baseline. MCI patients were then followed over 48 months, with 150 participants 
progressing to AD. Combining information from whole brain MR imaging and whole 
genome data was substantially superior to the standard model for predicting time 
to onset of AD in a 48-month national study of subjects at risk. Our findings 
demonstrate the promise of combined imaging-whole genome prognostic markers in 
people with mild memory impairment.

BACKGROUND: Smoking has been found associated with decreased cerebral volumes in 
healthy adults and in various neuropsychiatric disorders.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether chronic nicotine exposure through 
smoking is associated with reduced volume of cortically projecting cholinergic 
basal forebrain nuclei in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We retrieved cross-sectional data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database including 179 cognitively normal elderly 
subjects, 270 subjects with early stage MCI, 136 subjects in later, more 
advanced, stage of MCI, and 86 subjects in dementia stages of AD. We determined 
the association between past or current smoking versus lifetime non-smoker 
status on the volumes of the basal forebrain determined from volumetric MRI 
scans. Hippocampus volume was used as a control region. Significant effects were 
controlled for mediating or moderating effects of respiratory and cardiovascular 
morbidity.
RESULTS: In cognitively healthy individuals and early MCI, past or current 
smoking was significantly associated with smaller basal forebrain volume. This 
effect was independent from age, sex, or cardiovascular or respiratory 
morbidity. Hippocampus volume was not associated with smoking. In late MCI and 
AD dementia, smoking was not associated with basal forebrain or hippocampus 
volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that chronic nicotine exposure through smoking 
may lead to atrophy of cholinergic input areas of the basal forebrain. This 
effect may account for an increased risk of AD dementia onset with smoking by 
exhausting the cholinergic system reserve capacity.

Validating sensitive markers of hippocampal degeneration is fundamental for 
understanding neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In this 
paper, we test the hypothesis that free-water in the hippocampus will be more 
sensitive to early stages of cognitive decline than hippocampal volume, and that 
free-water in hippocampus will increase across distinct clinical stages of 
Alzheimer's disease. We examined two separate cohorts (N = 126; N = 112) of 
cognitively normal controls, early and late mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
Alzheimer's disease. Demographic, clinical, diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted 
imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were assessed. Results 
indicated elevated hippocampal free-water in early MCI individuals compared to 
controls across both cohorts. In contrast, there was no difference in volume of 
these regions between controls and early MCI. ADNI free-water values in the 
hippocampus was associated with low CSF AB1-42 levels and high global amyloid 
PET values. Free-water imaging of the hippocampus can serve as an early stage 
marker for AD and provides a complementary measure of AD neurodegeneration using 
non-invasive imaging.

Hippocampal atrophy is often considered as one of the important biomarkers for 
early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is an irreversible 
neurodegenerative disorder. Traditional methods for hippocampus analysis usually 
computed the shape and volume features from structural Magnetic Resonance Image 
(sMRI) for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD as well as its prodromal stage, 
i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Motivated by the success of deep 
learning, this paper proposes a deep learning method with the multi-channel 
cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradually learn the combined 
hierarchical representations of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries from the 
binary hippocampal masks for AD classification. First, image segmentation is 
performed to generate the bilateral hippocampus binary masks for each subject 
and the mask difference is obtained by subtracting them. Second, multi-channel 
3D CNNs are individually constructed on the hippocampus masks and mask 
differences to extract features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries for 
classification. Third, a 2D CNN is cascaded on the 3D CNNs to learn high-level 
correlation features. Finally, the features learned by multi-channel and 
cascaded CNNs are combined with a fully connected layer followed by a softmax 
classifier for disease classification. The proposed method can gradually learn 
the combined hierarchical features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries to 
enhance the classification. Our method is verified on the baseline sMRIs from 
807 subjects including 194 AD patients, 397 MCI (164 progressive MCI 
(pMCI) + 233 stable MCI (sMCI)), and 216 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate 
that the proposed method achieves an AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of 88.4%, 
74.6% and 71.9% for AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI classifications, 
respectively. It proves the promising classification performance and also shows 
that both hippocampal shape and asymmetry are helpful for AD diagnosis.

Measures of change in hippocampal volume derived from longitudinal MRI are a 
well-studied biomarker of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
are used in clinical trials to track therapeutic efficacy of disease-modifying 
treatments. However, longitudinal MRI change measures based on deformable 
registration can be confounded by MRI artifacts, resulting in over-estimation or 
underestimation of hippocampal atrophy. For example, the 
deformation-based-morphometry method ALOHA (Das et al., 2012) finds an increase 
in hippocampal volume in a substantial proportion of longitudinal scan pairs 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, unexpected, 
given that the hippocampal gray matter is lost with age and disease progression. 
We propose an alternative approach to quantify disease progression in the 
hippocampal region: to train a deep learning network (called DeepAtrophy) to 
infer temporal information from longitudinal scan pairs. The underlying 
assumption is that by learning to derive time-related information from scan 
pairs, the network implicitly learns to detect progressive changes that are 
related to aging and disease progression. Our network is trained using two 
categorical loss functions: one that measures the network's ability to correctly 
order two scans from the same subject, input in arbitrary order; and another 
that measures the ability to correctly infer the ratio of inter-scan intervals 
between two pairs of same-subject input scans. When applied to longitudinal MRI 
scan pairs from subjects unseen during training, DeepAtrophy achieves greater 
accuracy in scan temporal ordering and interscan interval inference tasks than 
ALOHA (88.5% vs. 75.5% and 81.1% vs. 75.0%, respectively). A scalar measure of 
time-related change in a subject level derived from DeepAtrophy is then examined 
as a biomarker of disease progression in the context of AD clinical trials. We 
find that this measure performs on par with ALOHA in discriminating groups of 
individuals at different stages of the AD continuum. Overall, our results 
suggest that using deep learning to infer temporal information from longitudinal 
MRI of the hippocampal region has good potential as a biomarker of disease 
progression, and hints that combining this approach with conventional 
deformation-based morphometry algorithms may lead to improved biomarkers in the 
future.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the whole brain from the cellular 
level to the entire brain network structure. The causal relationship among brain 
regions concerning the different AD stages is not yet investigated. This study 
used Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) method to assess effective connectivity (EC) 
and investigate the changes that accompany AD progression.
METHODS: We included the resting-state fMRI data of 34 AD patients, 31 late mild 
cognitive impairment (LMCI) patients, 34 early MCI (EMCI) patients, and 31 
cognitive normal (CN) subjects selected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) 
method was used to infer the effective connectivities and the corresponding 
probabilities. A linear regression analysis was carried out to test if the 
connection strengths could predict subjects' cognitive scores.
RESULTS: The results showed that the connections reduced from full connection in 
the CN group to no connection in the AD group. Statistical analysis showed the 
connectivity strengths were lower for later-stage patients. Linear regression 
analysis showed that the connection strengths were partially predictive of the 
cognitive scores.
DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated the dwindling connectivity accompanying AD 
progression on causal relationships among brain regions and indicated the 
potential of EC as a loyal biomarker in AD progression.

Imaging in neuroscience, clinical research and pharmaceutical trials often 
employs the 3D magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence to 
obtain structural T1-weighted images with high spatial resolution of the human 
brain. Typical research and clinical routine MPRAGE protocols with ~1mm 
isotropic resolution require data acquisition time in the range of 5-10min and 
often use only moderate two-fold acceleration factor for parallel imaging. 
Recent advances in MRI hardware and acquisition methodology promise improved 
leverage of the MR signal and more benign artefact properties in particular when 
employing increased acceleration factors in clinical routine and research. In 
this study, we examined four variants of a four-fold-accelerated MPRAGE protocol 
(2D-GRAPPA, CAIPIRINHA, CAIPIRINHA elliptical, and segmented MPRAGE) and 
compared clinical readings, basic image quality metrics (SNR, CNR), and 
automated brain tissue segmentation for morphological assessments of brain 
structures. The results were benchmarked against a widely-used 
two-fold-accelerated 3T ADNI MPRAGE protocol that served as reference in this 
study. 22 healthy subjects (age=20-44yrs.) were imaged with all MPRAGE variants 
in a single session. An experienced reader rated all images of clinically useful 
image quality. CAIPIRINHA MPRAGE scans were perceived on average to be of 
identical value for reading as the reference ADNI-2 protocol. SNR and CNR 
measurements exhibited the theoretically expected performance at the four-fold 
acceleration. The results of this study demonstrate that the four-fold 
accelerated protocols introduce systematic biases in the segmentation results of 
some brain structures compared to the reference ADNI-2 protocol. Furthermore, 
results suggest that the increased noise levels in the accelerated protocols 
play an important role in introducing these biases, at least under the present 
study conditions.

Intraindividual variability (IIV) across neuropsychological measures within a 
single testing session is a promising marker predictive of cognitive decline and 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that greater 
IIV is cross-sectionally associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), but 
not with cortical thickness or brain volume, in older adults without dementia 
who were amyloid beta (Aβ) positive. However, there is little known about the 
association between change in IIV and CBF over time. Therefore, we examined 
12-month longitudinal change in IIV and interactions of IIV and AD biomarker 
status on changes in regional CBF. Fifty-three non-demented Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants underwent lumbar puncture to obtain 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline and neuropsychological testing and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams at baseline and 12-month follow-up 
evaluation. IIV was calculated as the intraindividual standard deviation across 
6 demographically-corrected neuropsychological measures. Pulsed arterial spin 
labeling (ASL) MRI was acquired to quantify CBF and FreeSurfer-derived a priori 
CBF regions of interest (ROIs) were examined. AD biomarker positivity was 
determined using a published CSF p-tau/Aβ ratio cut-score. Change scores were 
calculated for IIV, CBF, and mean neuropsychological performance from baseline 
to 12 months. Hierarchical linear regression models showed that after adjusting 
for age and gender, there was a significant interaction between IIV change and 
biomarker-positivity (p-tau/Aβ+) for change in entorhinal and hippocampal CBF 
but not for the other ROIs. Specifically, increases in IIV were associated with 
reductions in entorhinal and hippocampal CBF among individuals who were 
biomarker-positive (n = 21). In contrast, there were no significant associations 
between change in IIV and CBF among those who were biomarker-negative (n = 32). 
Findings remained similar when analyses were performed adjusting for change in 
mean level of neuropsychological performance. Changes in IIV may be sensitive to 
changes in regional hypoperfusion in AD-vulnerable regions among AD 
biomarker-positive individuals, above and beyond demographics and mean 
neuropsychological performance. These findings provide further evidence 
supporting IIV as a potential marker of cerebrovascular brain changes in 
individuals at risk for dementia.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex is the earliest 
pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this feature has also 
been observed in cognitively normal (CN) individuals and those with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). The precise pathophysiology for the development of 
tau deposition remains unclear. We hypothesized that reduced cerebral perfusion 
is associated with the development of tau deposition.
METHODS: A subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set 
was utilized. Included patients had undergone arterial spin labeling perfusion 
MRI along with [18F]flortaucipir tau PET at baseline, within 1 year of the MRI, 
and a follow-up at 6 years. The association between baseline cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) and the baseline and 6-year tau PET was assessed. Univariate and 
multivariate linear modeling was performed, with p<0.05 indicating significance.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the CBF between patients with AD 
and MCI, and CN individuals in the left entorhinal cortex (p=0.013), but not in 
the right entorhinal cortex (p=0.076). The difference in maximum standardized 
uptake value ratio between 6 years and baseline was significantly and inversely 
associated with the baseline mean CBF (p=0.042, R²=0.54) in the left entorhinal 
cortex but not the right entorhinal cortex. Linear modeling demonstrated that 
CBF predicted 6-year tau deposition (p=0.015, R²=0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a reduction in CBF at the 
entorhinal cortex precedes tau deposition. Further work is needed to understand 
the mechanism underlying tau deposition in aging and disease.

Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus from 3D magnetic resonance imaging 
mostly relied on multi-atlas registration methods. In this work, we exploit 
recent advances in deep learning to design and implement a fully automatic 
segmentation method, offering both superior accuracy and fast result. The 
proposed method is based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 
incorporates distinct segmentation and error correction steps. Segmentation 
masks are produced by an ensemble of three independent models, operating with 
orthogonal slices of the input volume, while erroneous labels are subsequently 
corrected by a combination of Replace and Refine networks. We explore different 
training approaches and demonstrate how, in CNN-based segmentation, multiple 
datasets can be effectively combined through transfer learning techniques, 
allowing for improved segmentation quality. The proposed method was evaluated 
using two different public datasets and compared favorably to existing 
methodologies. In the EADC-ADNI HarP dataset, the correspondence between the 
method's output and the available ground truth manual tracings yielded a mean 
Dice value of 0.9015, while the required segmentation time for an entire MRI 
volume was 14.8 seconds. In the MICCAI dataset, the mean Dice value increased to 
0.8835 through transfer learning from the larger EADC-ADNI HarP dataset.

BACKGROUND: Current hypothetical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis 
emphasize the role of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau deposition, and neurodegenerative 
changes in the mesial temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal cortex and 
hippocampus. However, many individuals with clinical AD who come to autopsy also 
exhibit cerebrovascular disease. The relationship between AD and vascular 
pathology is unclear, especially whether they represent additive and independent 
effects on neuronal injury. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to (1) confirm whether entorhinal cortex and 
hippocampal volume are associated with memory among individuals with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for AD; and (2) determine 
whether regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, a radiological marker 
of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, is associated with entorhinal cortex 
and hippocampal volume independent of putative AD biomarkers in this group.
METHODS: Cognitive test scores, entorhinal cortex volume, hippocampus volume, 
intracranial volume, and cerebrospinal fluid-derived phosphorylated tau and 
Aβ1-42 protein levels were measured in 199 subjects with amnestic MCI (mean 
age = 74.89 ± 7.47). Lobar WMH volumes were derived from T1-, proton-density-, 
and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. We examined the association 
between entorhinal cortex volume and cognition. Next, we examined the 
association of tau and Aβ1-42 with entorhinal cortex volume and between lobar 
WMH and entorhinal cortex volume. Finally, tau, Aβ1-42, and regional WMH volumes 
were entered simultaneously to predict entorhinal cortex volume. We repeated the 
analyses with hippocampal volume instead of entorhinal cortex volume. The 
analyses were also repeated with the sample restricted to those MCI patients who 
transitioned to AD on subsequent ADNI follow-up visits (n = 86).
RESULTS: Larger entorhinal cortex volume was associated with better memory but 
not with performance on a task of executive functioning. Lower levels of Aβ1-42 
and higher temporal WMH volumes were associated with smaller entorhinal cortex 
volume. When entered simultaneously, temporal lobe WMH volume was more reliably 
associated with entorhinal cortex volume than was Aβ1-42. The findings were 
similar for hippocampus volume and when the sample was restricted to MCI 
patients who subsequently transitioned to AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the role of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 
volume in influencing memory decline in amnestic MCI, and emphasize that even in 
this nominally AD prodromal condition, WMH may be influencing regional 
neurodegeneration.

Whole-exome sequencing of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, combined 
with genotype imputation, was used to identify coding variants other than the 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele associated with rate of hippocampal volume 
loss using an extreme trait design. Matched unrelated APOE ε3 homozygous male 
Caucasian participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were selected at the extremes of the 2-year longitudinal change 
distribution of hippocampal volume (eight subjects with rapid rates of atrophy 
and eight with slow/stable rates of atrophy). We identified 57 non-synonymous 
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) which were found exclusively in at least 4 of 
8 subjects in the rapid atrophy group, but not in any of the 8 subjects in the 
slow atrophy group. Among these SNVs, the variants that accounted for the 
greatest group difference and were predicted in silico as 'probably damaging' 
missense variants were rs9610775 (CARD10) and rs1136410 (PARP1). To further 
investigate and extend the exome findings in a larger sample, we conducted 
quantitative trait analysis including whole-brain search in the remaining ADNI 
APOE ε3/ε3 group (N=315). Genetic variation within PARP1 and CARD10 was 
associated with rate of hippocampal neurodegeneration in APOE ε3/ε3. 
Meta-analysis across five independent cross sectional cohorts indicated that 
rs1136410 is also significantly associated with hippocampal volume in APOE ε3/ε3 
individuals (N=923). Larger sequencing studies and longitudinal follow-up are 
needed for confirmation. The combination of next-generation sequencing and 
quantitative imaging phenotypes holds significant promise for discovery of 
variants involved in neurodegeneration.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a powerful technique for non-invasive in-vivo 
imaging of the human brain. We employed a recently validated method for robust 
cross-sectional and longitudinal segmentation of MR brain images from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Specifically, we 
segmented 5074 MR brain images into 138 anatomical regions and extracted 
time-point specific structural volumes and volume change during follow-up 
intervals of 12 or 24 months. We assessed the extracted biomarkers by 
determining their power to predict diagnostic classification and by comparing 
atrophy rates to published meta-studies. The approach enables comprehensive 
analysis of structural changes within the whole brain. The discriminative power 
of individual biomarkers (volumes/atrophy rates) is on par with results 
published by other groups. We publish all quality-checked brain masks, 
structural segmentations, and extracted biomarkers along with this article. We 
further share the methodology for brain extraction (pincram) and segmentation 
(MALPEM, MALPEM4D) as open source projects with the community. The identified 
biomarkers hold great potential for deeper analysis, and the validated 
methodology can readily be applied to other imaging cohorts.

Changes in cognitive performance due to neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely correlated to the brain structure 
alteration. A univariate and personalized neurodegenerative biomarker with 
strong statistical power based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will benefit 
clinical diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, few 
biomarkers of this type have been developed, especially those that are robust to 
image noise and applicable to clinical analyses. In this paper, we introduce a 
variational framework to compute optimal transportation (OT) on brain structural 
MRI volumes and develop a univariate neuroimaging index based on OT to quantify 
neurodegenerative alterations. Specifically, we compute the OT from each image 
to a template and measure the Wasserstein distance between them. The obtained 
Wasserstein distance, Wasserstein Index (WI) for short to specify the distance 
to a template, is concise, informative and robust to random noise. Comparing to 
the popular linear programming-based OT computation method, our framework makes 
use of Newton's method, which makes it possible to compute WI in large-scale 
datasets. Experimental results, on 314 subjects (140 Aβ + AD and 174 Aβ- normal 
controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline 
dataset, provide preliminary evidence that the proposed WI is correlated with a 
clinical cognitive measure (the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score), and 
it is able to identify group difference and achieve a good classification 
accuracy, outperforming two other popular univariate indices including 
hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness. The current pilot work 
suggests the application of WI as a potential univariate neurodegenerative 
biomarker.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the sample sizes required for clinical trials 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying treatments using atrophy measures from 
serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the Japanese population.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the present study was to estimate how large 
a sample size would be needed for future clinical trials for AD-modifying 
treatments in Japan using atrophy measures of the brain as a surrogate 
biomarker.
METHODS: Sample sizes were estimated from the rates of change of the whole brain 
and hippocampus by the k-means normalized boundary shift integral (KN-BSI) and 
cognitive measures using the data of 537 Japanese Alzheimer's Neuroimaging 
Initiative (J-ADNI) participants with a linear mixed-effects model. We also 
examined the potential use of ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy.
RESULTS: The hippocampal atrophy rate required smaller sample sizes than 
cognitive measures of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Inclusion of ApoE 
status reduced sample sizes for AD and MCI patients in the atrophy measures.
CONCLUSION: These results show the potential use of longitudinal hippocampal 
atrophy measurement using automated image analysis as a progression biomarker 
and ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy in a clinical trial of 
AD-modifying treatment in Japanese people.

Women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) in terms of 
both disease prevalence and severity. Previous autopsy work has suggested that, 
in the presence of AD neuropathology, females are more susceptible to the 
clinical manifestation of AD. This manuscript extends that work by evaluating 
whether sex alters the established associations between cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarker levels and brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume, cognition). 
Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) and included individuals with normal cognition (n = 348), mild cognitive 
impairment (n = 565), and AD (n = 185). We leveraged mixed effects regression 
models to assess the interaction between sex and baseline cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarker levels of amyloid-β42 (Aβ-42) and total tau on cross-sectional and 
longitudinal brain aging outcomes. We found a significant interaction between 
sex and Aβ-42 on longitudinal hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.002), and longitudinal 
decline in memory (p = 0.017) and executive function (p = 0.025). Similarly, we 
observed an interaction between sex and total tau level on longitudinal 
hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.008), and longitudinal decline in executive function 
(p = 0.034). Women with Aβ-42 and total tau levels indicative of worse 
pathological changes showed more rapid hippocampal atrophy and cognitive 
decline. The sex difference was particularly pronounced among individuals with 
MCI, with lower education, and varied by APOE ε4 allele. These results suggest 
females may be more susceptible to the clinical manifestation of AD.

BACKGROUND: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage 
between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the clinical 
conversion from MCI to AD is unpredictable. Hence, identification of noninvasive 
biomarkers able to detect early changes induced by dementia is a pressing need.
PURPOSE: To explore the added value of histogram analysis applied to measures 
derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for detecting brain tissue 
differences between AD, MCI, and healthy subjects (HS).
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
POPULATION/SUBJECTS: A local cohort (57 AD, 28 MCI, 23 HS), and an Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (41 AD, 58 MCI, 41 HS).
FIELD STRENGTH: 3T. Dual-echo turbo spin echo (TSE); fluid-attenuated inversion 
recovery (FLAIR); modified-driven-equilibrium-Fourier-transform (MDEFT); 
inversion-recovery spoiled gradient recalled (IR-SPGR); diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI).
ASSESSMENT: Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) masks were obtained using the 
T1 -weighted volumes for tissue segmentation and T2 -weighted images for removal 
of hyperintensities/lesions. From DTI images, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean 
diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AXD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were 
obtained. NAWM histograms of FA, MD, AXD, and RD were derived and characterized 
estimating: peak height, peak location, mean value (MV), and quartiles (C25, 
C50, C75), which were compared between groups. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) and area under ROC curves (AUC) were calculated. To confirm our results, 
the same analysis was repeated on the ADNI dataset.
STATISTICAL TESTS: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), post-hoc Student's 
t-test, multiclass ROC analysis.
RESULTS: For the local cohort, C25 of AXD had the maximum capability of group 
discrimination with AUC of 0.80 for "HS vs. patients" comparison and 0.74 for 
"AD vs. others" comparison. For the ADNI cohort, MV of AXD revealed the maximum 
group discrimination capability with AUC of 0.75 for "HS vs. patients" 
comparison and 0.75 for "AD vs. others" comparison.
DATA CONCLUSION: AXD of NAWM might be an early marker of microstructural brain 
tissue changes occurring during the AD course and might be useful for assessing 
disease progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes irreversible 
damage to several brain regions, including the hippocampus causing impairment in 
cognition, function, and behaviour. Early diagnosis of the disease will reduce 
the suffering of the patients and their family members. Towards this aim, in 
this paper, we propose a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) 
architecture that employs the triplet-loss function for the representation of 
input MRI images as k-dimensional embeddings. We used both pre-trained and 
non-pretrained CNNs to transform images into the embedding space. These 
embeddings are subsequently used for the 4-way classification of Alzheimer's 
disease. The model efficacy was tested using the ADNI and OASIS datasets which 
produced an accuracy of 91.83% and 93.85%, respectively. Furthermore, obtained 
results are compared with similar methods proposed in the literature.

INTRODUCTION: Subjects with higher cognitive reserve (CR) may be at a lower risk 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the neural mechanisms underlying this are not 
known. Hippocampal volume loss is an early event in AD that triggers cognitive 
decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regression analyses of the effects of education on 
MRI-measured baseline HV in 675 subjects (201 normal, 329 with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and 146 subjects with mild AD), adjusting for age, gender, 
APOE ɛ4 status and intracranial volume (ICV). Subjects were derived from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a large US national 
biomarker study.
RESULTS: The association between higher education and larger HV was significant 
in AD (P=0.014) but not in cognitively normal or MCI subjects. In AD, HV was 
about 8% larger in a person with 20 years of education relative to someone with 
6 years of education. There was also a trend for the interaction between 
education and APOE ɛ4 to be significant in AD (P=0.056).
CONCLUSION: A potential protective association between higher education and 
lower hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD appears consistent with prior 
epidemiologic data linking higher education levels with lower rates of incident 
dementia. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

The hippocampus has a key role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such 
as Alzheimer's Disease. Here we present a novel method for the automated 
segmentation of the hippocampus from structural magnetic resonance images (MRI), 
based on a combination of multiple classifiers. The method is validated on a 
cohort of 50 T1 MRI scans, comprehending healthy control, mild cognitive 
impairment, and Alzheimer's Disease subjects. The preliminary release of the 
EADC-ADNI Harmonized Protocol training labels is used as gold standard. The 
fully automated pipeline consists of a registration using an affine 
transformation, the extraction of a local bounding box, and the classification 
of each voxel in two classes (background and hippocampus). The classification is 
performed slice-by-slice along each of the three orthogonal directions of the 
3D-MRI using a Random Forest (RF) classifier, followed by a fusion of the three 
full segmentations. Dice coefficients obtained by multiple RF (0.87 ± 0.03) are 
larger than those obtained by a single monolithic RF applied to the entire 
bounding box, and are comparable to state-of-the-art. A test on an external 
cohort of 50 T1 MRI scans shows that the presented method is robust and 
reliable. Additionally, a comparison of local changes in the morphology of the 
hippocampi between the three subject groups is performed. Our work showed that a 
multiple classification approach can be implemented for the segmentation for the 
measurement of volume and shape changes of the hippocampus with diagnostic 
purposes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Establishing accurate one-to-one morphological 
correspondence between different hippocampal surfaces is a solid foundation for 
the analysis of AD-induced hippocampal morphological changes. However, owing to 
the large variations between hippocampal surfaces, exiting registration work 
either fails to obtain the accurate matching of local and overall morphological 
features or does not preserve the bijectivity during parametric mapping. For 
this reason, this study proposes a hybrid-feature based spherical 
quasi-conformal registration (HSQR) method that can effectively maintain the 
diffeomorphic property while meeting the hybrid-feature matching constraints in 
the spherical parameter domain.
METHODS: The HSQR algorithm is primarily achieved through hippocampal surface 
hybrid feature extraction and spherical quasi-conformal registration. First, 
hybrid features for a comprehensive morphological description of the hippocampal 
surface were established, which included essential anatomical features 
(landmarks) and mean curvature (intensity) features to ensure the accuracy of 
surface morphology alignment. Second, spherical parameterization was applied to 
genus-0 closed surfaces, such as the hippocampus, which maximized the 
preservation of the original local surface morphology through area-preserving 
properties. Third, a novel spherical quasi-conformal registration algorithm that 
can handle large deformations is established. It transforms a 3D spherical 
parameter domain into a 2D plane parameter domain using iterative local stereo 
projection to improve the efficiency of the registration algorithm. 
Subsequently, by controlling the Beltramin coefficient, the hybrid morphological 
features could be aligned while ensuring bijection before and after 
registration.
RESULTS: Using a cohort including 161 patients with amyloid-β (Aβ) positive 
Alzheimer disease (AD), 234 Aβ positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 266 
Aβ negative cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, we set up the experiment which 
indicated that the HSQR-based whole bilateral hippocampal atrophy features 
demonstrated the stronger statistical power for group morphological differences 
of CU vs. MCI with q-value: 0.0453 for left hippocampus and 0.0401 for right 
hippocampus and group morphological differences of AD vs. MCI with q-value: 
0.0282 for left hippocampus and 0.0421 for right hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our registration algorithm may provide a solid foundation for the 
accurate quantification of hippocampal surface morphological changes for the 
differential diagnosis and tracking of AD.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain are now widely 
recognized as the defining hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by 
structural atrophy detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. 
One of the particular neurodegenerative regions is the hippocampus to which the 
influence of Aβ/tau on has been one of the research focuses in the AD 
pathophysiological progress. This work proposes a novel framework, Federated 
Morphometry Feature Selection (FMFS) model, to examine subtle aspects of 
hippocampal morphometry that are associated with Aβ/tau burden in the brain, 
measured using positron emission tomography (PET). FMFS is comprised of 
hippocampal surface-based feature calculation, patch-based feature selection, 
federated group LASSO regression, federated screening rule-based stability 
selection, and region of interest (ROI) identification. FMFS was tested on two 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts to understand 
hippocampal alterations that relate to Aβ/tau depositions. Each cohort included 
pairs of MRI and PET for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) subjects. Experimental results demonstrated that FMFS achieves 
an 89× speedup compared to other published state-of-the-art methods under five 
independent hypothetical institutions. In addition, the subiculum and cornu 
ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) were identified as hippocampal subregions where atrophy 
is strongly associated with abnormal Aβ/tau. As potential biomarkers for Aβ/tau 
pathology, the features from the identified ROIs had greater power for 
predicting cognitive assessment and for survival analysis than five other 
imaging biomarkers. All the results indicate that FMFS is an efficient and 
effective tool to reveal associations between Aβ/tau burden and hippocampal 
morphometry.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation is proposed as a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study assessed cross-sectional relationships 
between cortisol and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure and glucose 
metabolism across the AD spectrum. Participants with normal cognition, mild 
cognitive impairment, and AD were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative databank, based on baseline measures of plasma cortisol, 
gray matter volume (n = 556), and cerebral glucose metabolism (n = 288). 
Relationships between plasma cortisol and the neuroimaging biomarkers were 
assessed. Across the entire cohort, higher plasma cortisol levels were 
associated with lower glucose metabolism in lateral and medial parietal regions. 
Higher plasma cortisol was also related to lower gray matter volume in 
temporal-parietal-occipital regions and in the hippocampus. There were no 
significant group differences in these relationships with adjustment for 
covariates. Our results demonstrate that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
activation is related to glucose hypometabolism within posterior cortical 
regions vulnerable to AD pathology. This regional pattern appears to be distinct 
from cortisol-related associations with brain structure. Future studies should 
delineate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects.

Major depression disorder is one of the diseases with the highest rate of 
disability and morbidity and is associated with numerous structural and 
functional differences in neural systems. However, it is difficult to analyze 
digital medical imaging data without computational intervention. A voxel-wise 
densely connected convolutional neural network, Three-dimensional Densenet 
(3D-DenseNet), is proposed to mine the feature differences. In addition, a novel 
transfer learning method, called Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
Transfer (ADNI-Transfer), is designed and combined with the proposed 
3D-DenseNet. The experimental results on a database that contains 174 subjects, 
including 99 patients with major depression disorder and 75 healthy controls, 
show that large changes in brain structures between major depressive disorder 
patients and healthy controls mainly are located in the regions including 
superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral, middle temporal gyrus, middle frontal 
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus. In addition, the proposed 
deep learning network can better extract different features of brain structures 
between major depressive disorder patients and healthy controls and achieve 
excellent classification results of major depressive disorder. At the same time, 
the designed transfer learning method can further improve classification 
performance. These results verify that our proposed method is feasible and valid 
for diagnosing and analyzing major depression disorder.

BACKGROUND: The hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) describes high amyloid deposition and hypometabolism at the mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) stage. However, it remains unknown whether brain amyloidosis 
and hypometabolism follow the same trajectories in MCI individuals. We used the 
concept of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) as defined by the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-Go in order to compare the biomarker 
profile between EMCI and LMCI.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the global and voxel-based neocortical amyloid burden and 
metabolism among individuals who are cognitively normal (CN), as well as those 
with EMCI, LMCI and mild AD.
METHODS: In the present study, 354 participants, including CN (n = 109), EMCI (n 
= 157), LMCI (n = 39) and AD (n = 49), were enrolled between September 2009 and 
November 2011 through ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. Brain amyloid load and metabolism were 
estimated using [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) PET, 
respectively. Uptake ratio images of [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]FDG were calculated 
by dividing the summed PET image by the median counts of the grey matter of the 
cerebellum and pons, respectively. Group differences of global [(18)F]AV45 and 
[(18)F]FDG were analyzed using ANOVA, while the voxel-based group differences 
were estimated using statistic parametric mapping (SPM).
RESULTS: EMCI patients showed higher global [(18)F]AV45 retention compared to CN 
and lower uptake compared to LMCI. SPM detected higher [(18)F]AV45 uptake in 
EMCI compared to CN in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, medial and dorsal 
lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. EMCI showed lower [(18)F]AV45 
retention than LMCI in the superior temporal, inferior parietal, as well as 
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. Regarding to the global 
[(18)F]FDG, EMCI patients showed no significant difference from CN and a higher 
uptake ratio compared to LMCI. At the voxel level, EMCI showed higher metabolism 
in precuneus, hippocampus, entorhinal and inferior parietal cortices, as 
compared to LMCI.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that brain metabolism remains normal 
despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation in EMCI. These results 
suggest a role for anti-amyloid interventions in EMCI aiming to delay or halt 
the deposition of amyloid and related metabolism impairment.

Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Progression with Multi-Information Generative 
Adversarial Network.

Zhao Y, Ma B, Jiang P, Zeng D, Wang X, Li S.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, and its 
long-term progression prediction is definitely important. The structural 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) can be used to characterize the cortical 
atrophy that is closely coupled with clinical symptoms in AD and its prodromal 
stages. Many existing methods have focused on predicting the cognitive scores at 
future time-points using a set of morphological features derived from sMRI. The 
3D sMRI can provide more massive information than the cognitive scores. However, 
very few works consider to predict an individual brain MRI image at future 
time-points. In this article, we propose a disease progression prediction 
framework that comprises a 3D multi-information generative adversarial network 
(mi-GAN) to predict what one's whole brain will look like with an interval, and 
a 3D DenseNet based multi-class classification network optimized with a focal 
loss to determine the clinical stage of the estimated brain. The mi-GAN can 
generate high-quality individual 3D brain MRI image conditioning on the 
individual 3D brain sMRI and multi-information at the baseline time-point. 
Experiments are implemented on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Our mi-GAN shows the state-of-the-art performance with the structural 
similarity index (SSIM) of 0.943 between the real MRI images at the fourth year 
and the generated ones. With mi-GAN and focal loss, the pMCI vs. sMCI accuracy 
achieves 6.04% improvement in comparison with conditional GAN and cross entropy 
loss.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
abnormal proteins, such as β-amyloid and tau, in the brain, which precedes 
cognitive impairment. Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk 
factor for AD, few studies have investigated how the presence of DM affects the 
sequential pathogenesis of AD, specifically within the 
amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) and cognition framework.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the trajectories of ATN biomarkers in 
relation to the presence of DM in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD.
DESIGN: Participants with normal cognition (CN) or mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) at baseline were included. Subjects were followed for 12-192 months, with 
neuroimaging and cognitive assessments conducted at every 12 or 24 months.
SETTING: This study utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 603 participants aged 55-90 years were included, 
comprising 284 CN (25 with DM, 259 without DM) and 319 MCI (39 with DM, 280 
without DM) individuals.
MEASUREMENTS: ATN biomarkers were identified using florbetapir positron emission 
tomography (PET), flortaucipir PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
respectively. Cognition was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes (CDR-SB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Moderation analysis was 
conducted to investigate the effect of DM on the association between ATN 
biomarkers of AD.
RESULTS: Elevated amyloid standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were 
associated with increased tau levels in the hippocampus, and this association 
was significantly enhanced by the presence of DM in MCI participants 
(p = 0.021). DM also strengthened the association between increased tau SUVR 
levels and neurodegeneration (indicated by decreased entorhinal cortical 
volumes; p = 0.005) in those with MCI. Furthermore, DM enhanced the association 
of decreased entorhinal (p = 0.012) and middle temporal cortex (p = 0.031) 
volumes with increased (worsened) CDR-SB scores in MCI participants. However, DM 
did not predict significant longitudinal changes in ATN pathology or cognitive 
decline in CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DM may increase the risk of AD by 
accelerating each step of the A-T-N cascade in the prodromal stage of AD, 
underscoring the importance of DM management in preventing the MCI conversion to 
AD.

For patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the likelihood of progression 
to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important not only for individual 
patient care, but also for the identification of participants in clinical trial, 
so as to provide early interventions. Biomarkers based on various neuroimaging 
modalities could offer complementary information regarding different aspects of 
disease progression. The current study adopted a weighted multi-modality sparse 
representation-based classification method to combine data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, from three imaging modalities: 
Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
emission tomography (PET), and florbetapir PET. We included 117 normal controls 
(NC) and 110 MCI patients, 27 of whom progressed to AD within 36 months (pMCI), 
while the remaining 83 remained stable (sMCI) over the same time period. 
Modality-specific biomarkers were identified to distinguish MCI from NC and to 
predict pMCI among MCI. These included the hippocampus, amygdala, middle 
temporal and inferior temporal regions for MRI, the posterior cingulum, 
precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, amygdala, 
and putamen for florbetapir PET. Results indicated that FDG-PET may be a more 
effective modality in discriminating MCI from NC and in predicting pMCI than 
florbetapir PET and MRI. Combining modality-specific sensitive biomarkers from 
the three modalities boosted the discrimination accuracy of MCI from NC (76.7%) 
and the prediction accuracy of pMCI (82.5%) when compared with the best 
single-modality results (73.6% for MCI and 75.6% for pMCI with FDG-PET).

Recently, 19 susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) had been 
identified through AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis. 
However, how they influence the pathogenesis of AD still remains largely 
unknown. We studied those loci with six MRI measures, abnormal glucose 
metabolism, and β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition on neuroimaging in a large cohort from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database in order to provide 
clues of the mechanisms through which these genetic variants might be acting. As 
a result, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at rs983392 within MS4A6A and 
rs11218343 within SOLR1 were both associated with the percentage of increase in 
the volume of left inferior temporal regions in the follow-up study. Meanwhile, 
rs11218343 at SORL1 and rs6733839 at BIN1 was associated with rate of volume 
change of left parahippocampal and right inferior parietal, respectively. 
Moreover, rs6656401 at CR1 and rs983392 at MS4A6A were both associated with 
smaller volume of right middle temporal at baseline. However, in addition to the 
APOE locus, we did not detect any influence on glucose metabolism and Aβ 
deposition. APOE ε4 allele was associated with almost all measures. Altogether, 
five loci (rs6656401 at CR1, rs983392within MS4A6A, rs11218343 at SORL1, 
rs6733839 at BIN1, and APOE ε4) have been detected to be associated with one or 
a few established AD-related neuroimaging measures.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The neuropathologic changes underlying Alzheimer 
disease (AD) start before overt cognitive symptoms arise, but it is not 
well-known how they relate to the first subtle cognitive changes. The objective 
for this study was to examine the independent associations of the AD hallmarks 
β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration with different cognitive domains in 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, CU participants from the prospective 
BioFINDER-2 study were included. All had CSF biomarkers (Aβ42 and phosphorylated 
tau [p-tau]181), MRI (cortical thickness of AD-susceptible regions), Aβ-PET 
(neocortical uptake), tau-PET (entorhinal uptake), and cognitive test data for 
memory, executive function, verbal function, and visuospatial function. 
Multivariable linear regression models were performed using either CSF Aβ42, 
p-tau181, and cortical thickness or Aβ-PET, tau-PET, and cortical thickness as 
predictors of cognitive function. The results were validated in an independent 
cohort (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]).
RESULTS: A total of 316 CU participants were included from the BioFINDER-2 
study. Abnormal Aβ status was independently associated with the executive 
measure, regardless of modality (CSF Aβ42, β = 0.128, p = 0.024; Aβ-PET, β = 
0.124, p = 0.049), while tau was independently associated with memory (CSF 
p-tau181, β = 0.132, p = 0.018; tau-PET, β = 0.189, p = 0.002). Cortical 
thickness was independently associated with the executive measure and verbal 
fluency in both models (p = 0.005-0.018). To examine the relationships in the 
earliest stage of preclinical AD, only participants with normal biomarkers of 
tau and neurodegeneration were included (n = 217 CSF-based; n = 246 PET-based). 
Again, Aβ status was associated with executive function (CSF Aβ42, β = 0.189, p 
= 0.005; Aβ-PET, β = 0.146, p = 0.023), but not with other cognitive domains. 
The results were overall replicated in the ADNI cohort (n = 361).
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that Aβ is independently associated with 
worse performance on an executive measure but not with memory performance, which 
instead is associated with tau pathology. This may have implications for early 
preclinical AD screening and outcome measures in AD trials targeting Aβ 
pathology.

Numerous artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches have been proposed for 
automatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction with brain structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (sMRI). Previous studies extract features from the whole brain 
or individual slices separately, ignoring the properties of multi-view slices 
and feature complementarity. For this reason, we present a novel AD diagnosis 
model based on the multiview-slice attention and 3D convolution neural network 
(3D-CNN). Specifically, we begin by extracting the local slice-level 
characteristic in various dimensions using multiple sub-networks. Then we 
proposed a slice-level attention mechanism to emphasize specific 2D-slices to 
exclude the redundancy features. After that, a 3D-CNN was employed to capture 
the global subject-level structural changes. Finally, all these 2D and 3D 
features were fused to obtain more discriminative representations. We conduct 
the experiments on 1,451 subjects from ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets. Experimental 
results showed the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art approaches 
regarding dementia classification. Specifically, our model achieves accuracy 
values of 91.1 and 80.1% on ADNI-1 for AD diagnosis and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) convention prediction, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR) shows protective effects on cognitive 
function in older adult and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the brain 
mechanisms underlying the CR effect on the non-dementia AD spectrum (subjective 
cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) are unknown. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the potential moderate effect of CR on 
brain functional networks associated with cognitive performance.
METHODS: We selected 200 participants, including 48 cognitively normal (CN) and 
56 SCD, and 96 patients with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Seed-based locus coeruleus functional connectivity (LC FC) 
was conducted to detect early brain functional changes in the non-dementia AD 
spectrum. CR was assessed via years of education and intelligence (IQ). The ANDI 
composite executive function scores (ADNI-EF) and ADNI composite memory scores 
(ANDI-MEM) at baseline and 24-month follow-up were used to assess cognitive 
performance.
RESULTS: Compared to the CN group, the SCD group showed abnormal LC FC with the 
executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), salience 
network, sensorimotor network, reward network, and hippocampus, while these 
alterations were inverted at the MCI stage. The LC-hippocampus FC was correlated 
with ADNI-MEM at baseline and follow-up, and these relationships were moderated 
by education. The LC-DLPFC FC was correlated with ADNI-EF at baseline, and this 
association was moderated by IQ.
CONCLUSION: Our results manifested that higher levels of CR would confer 
protective effects on SCD and MCI. Furthermore, IQ and education could moderate 
the relationship between LC FC and cognition through different pathways.

In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), timely identification is paramount 
for effective management, acknowledging its chronic and irreversible nature, 
where medications can only impede its progression. Our study introduces a 
holistic solution, leveraging the hippocampus and the VGG16 model with transfer 
learning for early AD detection. The hippocampus, a pivotal early affected 
region linked to memory, plays a central role in classifying patients into three 
categories: cognitively normal (CN), representing individuals without cognitive 
impairment; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), indicative of a subtle decline in 
cognitive abilities; and AD, denoting Alzheimer's disease. Employing the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, our model undergoes 
training enriched by advanced image preprocessing techniques, achieving 
outstanding accuracy (testing 98.17 %, validation 97.52 %, training 99.62 %). 
The strategic use of transfer learning fortifies our competitive edge, 
incorporating the hippocampus approach and, notably, a progressive data 
augmentation technique. This innovative augmentation strategy gradually 
introduces augmentation factors during training, significantly elevating 
accuracy and enhancing the model's generalization ability. The study emphasizes 
practical application with a user-friendly website, empowering radiologists to 
predict class probabilities, track disease progression, and visualize patient 
images in both 2D and 3D formats, contributing significantly to the advancement 
of early AD detection.

The cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33) has been proved as a susceptibility 
locus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) based on recent 
genetic studies. Numerous studies have shown that multiple neuroimaging measures 
are potent predictors of AD risk and progression, and these measures are also 
affected by genetic variations in AD. Figuring out the association between CD33 
genetic variations and AD-related brain atrophy may shed light on the underlying 
mechanisms of CD33-related AD pathogenesis. Thus, we investigated the influence 
of CD33 genotypes on AD-related brain atrophy to clarify the possible means by 
which CD33 impacts AD. A total of 48 individuals with probable AD, 483 mild 
cognitive impairment, and 281 cognitively normal controls were recruited from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We investigated 
the influence of CD33 SNPs on hippocampal volume, parahippocampal gyrus volume, 
posterior cingulate volume, middle temporal volume, hippocampus CA1 subregion 
volume, and entorhinal cortex thickness. We found that brain regions 
significantly affected by CD33 genetic variations were restricted to hippocampal 
and parahippocampal gyrus in hybrid population, which were further validated in 
subpopulation (MCI and NC) analysis. These findings reaffirm the importance of 
the hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus in AD pathogenesis, and present 
evidences for the CD33 variations influence on the atrophy of specific 
AD-related brain structures. Our findings raise the possibility that CD33 
polymorphisms contribute to the AD risk by altering the neuronal degeneration of 
hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral (plasma) and central (cerebrospinal fluid, CSF) measures 
of tau are higher in Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to prodromal stages and 
controls. While elevated CSF tau concentrations have been shown to be associated 
with lower grey matter density (GMD) in AD-specific regions, this correlation 
has yet to be examined for plasma in a large study.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the neuroanatomical correlates of plasma tau using 
voxel-based analysis.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data for 508 ADNI participants were collected for 
clinical, plasma total-tau (t-tau), CSF amyloid (Aβ42) and tau, and MRI 
variables. The relationship between plasma tau and GMD and between CSF t-tau and 
GMD were assessed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using regression models. Age, sex, 
APOEɛ4 status, diagnosis, and total intracranial volume were used as covariates 
where appropriate. Participants were defined as amyloid positive (Aβ+) if CSF 
Aβ42 was <192 pg/mL.
RESULTS: Plasma tau was negatively correlated with GMD in the medial temporal 
lobe (MTL), precuneus, thalamus, and striatum. The associations with thalamus 
and striatum were independent of diagnosis. A negative correlation also existed 
between plasma tau and GMD in Aβ+ participants in the MTL, precuneus, and 
frontal lobe. When compared to CSF t-tau, plasma tau showed a notably different 
associated brain atrophy pattern, with only small overlapping regions in the 
fusiform gyrus.
CONCLUSION: Plasma tau may serve as a non-specific marker for neurodegeneration 
but is still relevant to AD considering low GMD was associated with plasma tau 
in Aβ+ participants and not Aβ-participants.

There is substantial biological heterogeneity among older adults with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We hypothesized that this heterogeneity can be 
detected solely based on volumetric MRI measures, which potentially have 
clinical implications and can improve our ability to predict clinical outcomes. 
We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups among persons with 
aMCI (n = 696) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), based on baseline volumetric MRI measures. We used volumetric measures 
of 10 different brain regions. The subgroups were validated with respect to 
demographics, cognitive performance, and other AD biomarkers. The subgroups were 
compared with each other and with normal and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups 
with respect to baseline cognitive function and longitudinal rate of conversion. 
Four aMCI subgroups emerged with distinct MRI patterns: The first subgroup 
(n = 404), most similar to normal controls in volumetric characteristics and 
cognitive function, had the lowest incidence of AD. The second subgroup 
(n = 230) had the most similar MRI profile to early AD, along with poor 
performance in memory and executive function domains. The third subgroup 
(n = 36) had the highest global atrophy, very small hippocampus and worst 
overall cognitive performance. The fourth subgroup (n = 26) had the least amount 
of atrophy, however still had poor cognitive function specifically in in the 
executive function domain. Individuals with aMCI who were clinically categorized 
within one group other showed substantial heterogeneity based on MRI volumetric 
measures.

AIMS: The early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are no longer insurmountable. 
Therefore, identifying at-risk individuals is of great importance for precise 
treatment. We developed a model to predict cognitive deterioration in patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database, we constructed models in a derivation cohort of 761 participants with 
MCI (138 of whom developed dementia at the 36th month) and verified them in a 
validation cohort of 353 cognitively normal controls (54 developed MCI and 19 
developed dementia at the 36th month). In addition, 1303 participants with 
available AD cerebrospinal fluid core biomarkers were selected to clarify the 
ability of the model to predict AD core features. We assessed 32 parameters as 
candidate predictors, including clinical information, blood biomarkers, and 
structural imaging features, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis 
to develop our prediction model.
RESULTS: Six independent variables of MCI deterioration were identified: 
apolipoprotein E ε4 allele status, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, 
higher levels of plasma pTau181, smaller volumes of the left hippocampus and 
right amygdala, and a thinner right inferior temporal cortex. We established an 
easy-to-use risk heat map and risk score based on these risk factors. The area 
under the curve (AUC) for both internal and external validations was close to 
0.850. Furthermore, the AUC was above 0.800 in identifying participants with 
high brain amyloid-β loads. Calibration plots demonstrated good agreement 
between the predicted probability and actual observations in the internal and 
external validations.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate prediction model for dementia 
conversion in patients with MCI. Simultaneously, the model predicts AD-specific 
pathological changes. We hope that this model will contribute to more precise 
clinical treatment and better healthcare resource allocation.

SienaX and Siena are widely used and fully automated algorithms for measuring 
whole brain volume and volume change in cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI 
studies and are particularly useful in studies of brain atrophy. The 
reproducibility of the algorithms was assessed using the 3D T1 weighted MP-RAGE 
scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The 
back-to-back (BTB) MP-RAGE scans in the ADNI data set makes it a valuable 
benchmark against which to assess the performance of algorithms of measuring 
atrophy in the human brain with MRI scans. A total of 671 subjects were included 
for SienaX and 385 subjects for Siena. The annual percentage brain volume change 
(PBVC) rates were -0.65±0.82%/year for the healthy controls, -1.15±1.21%/year 
for mild cognitively impairment (MCI) and -1.84±1.33%/year for AD, in line with 
previous findings. The median of the absolute value of the reproducibility of 
SienaX's normalized brain volume (NBV) was 0.96% while the 90th percentile was 
5.11%. The reproducibility of Siena's PBVC had a median of 0.35% and a 90th 
percentile of 1.37%. While the median reproducibility for SienaX's NBV was in 
line with the values previously reported in the literature, the median 
reproducibility of Siena's PBVC was about twice that reported. Also, the 90th 
percentiles for both SienaX and Siena were about twice the size that would be 
expected for a Gaussian distribution. Because of the natural variation of the 
disease among patients over a year, a perfectly reproducible whole brain atrophy 
algorithm would reduce the estimated group size needed to detect a specified

IMPORTANCE: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOEε4) is the single most important genetic 
risk factor for Alzheimer disease. While APOEε4 is associated with increased 
amyloid-β burden, its association with cerebral tau pathology has been 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether APOEε4 is associated with medial temporal tau 
pathology independently of amyloid-β, sex, clinical status, and age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a study of 2 cross-sectional cohorts 
of volunteers who were cognitively normal, had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
or had Alzheimer disease dementia: the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and 
Dementia (TRIAD) study (data collected between October 2017 and July 2019) and 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (collected between 
November 2015 and June 2019). The first cohort (TRIAD) comprised cognitively 
normal elderly participants (n = 124), participants with MCI (n = 50), and 
participants with Alzheimer disease (n = 50) who underwent tau positron emission 
tomography (PET) with fluorine 18-labeled MK6240 and amyloid-β PET with 
[18F]AZD4694. The second sample (ADNI) was composed of cognitively normal 
elderly participants (n = 157), participants with MCI (n = 83), and participants 
with Alzheimer disease (n = 25) who underwent tau PET with [18F]flortaucipir and 
amyloid-β PET with [18F]florbetapir. Exclusion criteria were a history of other 
neurological disorders, stroke, or head trauma. There were 489 eligible 
participants, selected based on availability of amyloid-PET, tau-PET, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and genotyping for APOEε4. Forty-five young adults (<30 
years) from the TRIAD cohort were not selected for this study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A main association between APOEε4 and tau-PET 
standardized uptake value ratio, correcting for age, sex, clinical status, and 
neocortical amyloid-PET standardized uptake value ratio.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 489 participants was 70.5 (7.1) years; 171 
were APOEε4 carriers (34.9%), and 230 of 489 were men. In both cohorts, APOEε4 
was associated in increased tau-PET uptake in the entorhinal cortex and 
hippocampus independently of amyloid-β, sex, age, and clinical status after 
multiple comparisons correction (TRIAD: β = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.49; ADNI: 
β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.19; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results indicate that the elevated risk of 
developing dementia conferred by APOEε4 genotype involves mechanisms associated 
with both amyloid-β and tau aggregation. These results contribute to an evolving 
framework in which APOEε4 has deleterious consequences in Alzheimer disease 
beyond its link with amyloid-β and suggest APOEε4 as a potential target for 
future disease-modifying therapeutic trials targeting tau pathology.

In neurodegeneration research, normalization of regional volumes by intracranial 
volume (ICV) is important to estimate the extent of disease-driven atrophy. 
There is little agreement as to whether raw volumes, volume-to-ICV fractions or 
regional volumes from which the ICV factor has been regressed out should be used 
for volumetric brain imaging studies. Using multiple regional cortical and 
subcortical volumetric measures generated by Freesurfer (51 in total), the main 
aim of this study was to elucidate the implications of these adjustment 
approaches. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed from two large 
cohorts, the population-based PIVUS cohort (N = 406, all subjects age 75) and 
the Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 724). Further, 
we studied whether the chosen ICV normalization approach influenced the 
relationship between hippocampus and cognition in the three diagnostic groups of 
the ADNI cohort (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy 
individuals). The ability of raw vs. adjusted hippocampal volumes to predict 
diagnostic status was also assessed. In both cohorts raw volumes correlate 
positively with ICV, but do not scale directly proportionally with it. The 
correlation direction is reversed for all volume-to-ICV fractions, except the 
lateral and third ventricles. Most gray matter fractions are larger in females, 
while lateral ventricle fractions are greater in males. Residual correction 
effectively eliminated the correlation between the regional volumes and ICV and 
removed gender differences. The association between hippocampal volumes and 
cognition was not altered by ICV normalization. Comparing prediction of 
diagnostic status using the different approaches, small but significant 
differences were found. The choice of normalization approach should be carefully 
considered when designing a volumetric brain imaging study.

Selective vulnerability and resilience to Alzheimer's disease tauopathy as a 
function of genes and the connectome.

Anand C, Torok J, Abdelnour F, Maia PD, Raj A.

Brain regions in Alzheimer's (AD) exhibit distinct vulnerability to the 
disease's hallmark pathology, with the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 
succumbing early to tau tangles while others like primary sensory cortices 
remain resilient. The quest to understand how local/regional genetic factors, 
pathogenesis, and network-mediated spread of pathology together govern this 
selective vulnerability (SV) or resilience (SR) is ongoing. Although many risk 
genes in AD are known from gene association and transgenic studies, it is still 
not known whether and how their baseline expression signatures confer SV or SR 
to brain structures. Prior analyses have yielded conflicting results, pointing 
to a disconnect between the location of genetic risk factors and downstream tau 
pathology. We hypothesize that a full accounting of genes' role in mediating 
SV/SR would require the modeling of network-based vulnerability, whereby tau 
misfolds, aggregates, and propagates along fiber projections. We therefore 
employed an extended network diffusion model (eNDM) and tested it on tau 
pathology PET data from 196 AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Thus the fitted eNDM model becomes a reference 
process from which to assess the role of innate genetic factors. Using the 
residual (observed - model-predicted) tau as a novel target outcome, we obtained 
its association with 100 top AD risk-genes, whose baseline spatial 
transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). 
We found that while many risk genes at baseline showed a strong association with 
regional tau, many more showed a stronger association with residual tau. This 
suggests that both direct vulnerability, related to the network, as well as 
network-independent vulnerability, are conferred by risk genes. We then 
classified risk genes into four classes: network-related SV (SV-NR), 
network-independent SV (SV-NI), network-related SR (SR-NR), and 
network-independent SR (SR-NI). Each class has a distinct spatial signature and 
associated vulnerability to tau. Remarkably, we found from gene-ontology 
analyses, that genes in these classes were enriched in distinct functional 
processes and encompassed different functional networks. These findings offer 
new insights into the factors governing innate vulnerability or resilience in AD 
pathophysiology and may prove helpful in identifying potential intervention 
targets.

BACKGROUND: The way to evaluate brain tau pathology in vivo is tau positron 
emission tomography (tau-PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. In the 
clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a proportion of tau-PET 
are negative. Interest in less expensive and convenient ways to detect tau 
pathology in Alzheimer's disease has increased due to the high cost of tau-PET 
and the invasiveness of lumbar puncture, which typically slows down the cost and 
enrollment of clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate one simple and effective method in predicting 
tau-PET status in MCI individuals.
METHODS: The sample included 154 individuals which were dichotomized into 
tau-PET (+) and tau-PET (-) using a cut-off of >1.33. We used stepwise 
regression to select the unitary or combination of variables that best predicted 
tau-PET. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the 
accuracy of single and multiple clinical markers.
RESULTS: The combined performance of three variables [Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13), Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), ADNI-Memory summary score (ADNI-MEM)] in neurocognitive 
measures demonstrated good predictive accuracy of tau-PET status 
[accuracy = 85.7%, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.879]. The combination of 
clinical markers model (APOEɛ4, neurocognitive measures and structural MRI 
imaging of middle temporal) had the best discriminative power (AUC = 0.946).
CONCLUSION: As a noninvasive test, the combination of APOEɛ4, neurocognitive 
measures and structural MRI imaging of middle temporal accurately predicts 
tau-PET status. The finding may provide a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for 
clinical application in predicting tau pathology among MCI individuals.

BACKGROUND: Greater intracranial volume (ICV) has been associated with less 
severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms at a given level of cerebral pathology. 
In this study we examine whether ICV modulates the association between clinical 
disease progression on the one hand and brain atrophy or the apolipoprotein E 
genotype on the other.
METHODS: Six hundred seventy-four subjects were studied from the AD Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Subjects included 204 controls, 144 patients with AD 
dementia, and 326 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Longitudinal 
analyses were conducted applying generalized estimating equations to examine the 
influence of ICV on clinical deterioration and atrophy progression. Follow-up 
data were available for up to 60 months after the baseline visit (mean 31.42 
months, SD 13.12 months).
RESULTS: ICV was not directly associated with clinical worsening or atrophy 
progression. However, ICV attenuated the impact of atrophy and the 
apolipoprotein E ε4 allele on clinical disease progression in aMCI.
CONCLUSION: Greater ICV, that is, premorbid brain size, seems to protect against 
clinical deterioration in the face of AD-related brain atrophy in aMCI. The 
results support the theory of a compensatory role of brain reserve in contrast 
to a neuroprotective role. The protective effects of morphologic reserve seem to 
be limited to early clinical AD; once a certain threshold of neurodegenerative 
burden is passed, a larger premorbid brain no longer offers an advantage in this 
context.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate feasible gray matter microstructural 
biomarkers with high sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection. 
We propose a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measure, "radiality", as an early AD 
biomarker. It is the dot product of the normal vector of the cortical surface 
and primary diffusion direction, which reflects the fiber orientation within the 
cortical column.
METHODS: We analyzed neuroimages from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, including images from 78 cognitively normal (CN), 50 
early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 34 late mild cognitive impairment 
(LMCI), and 39 AD patients. We then evaluated the cortical thickness (CTh), mean 
diffusivity (MD), which are conventional AD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
biomarkers, and the amount of accumulated amyloid and tau using positron 
emission tomography (PET). Radiality was projected on the gray matter surface to 
compare and validate the changes with different stages alongside other 
neuroimage biomarkers.
RESULTS: The results revealed decreased radiality primarily in the entorhinal, 
insula, frontal, and temporal cortex with further progression of disease. In 
particular, radiality could delineate the difference between the CN and EMCI 
groups, while the other biomarkers could not. We examined the relationship 
between radiality and other biomarkers to validate its pathological evidence in 
AD. Overall, radiality showed a high association with conventional biomarkers. 
Additional ROI analysis revealed the dynamics of AD-related changes as stages 
onward.
CONCLUSION: Radiality in cortical gray matter showed AD-specific changes and 
relevance with other conventional AD biomarkers with high sensitivity. Moreover, 
radiality could identify the group differences seen in EMCI, representative of 
changes in early AD, which supports its superiority in early diagnosis compared 
to that possible with conventional biomarkers. We provide evidence of structural 
changes with cognitive impairment and suggest radiality as a sensitive biomarker 
for identifying early AD.

HLA-A is a locus of the major histocompatibility complex situated on chromosome 
6p21.3. HLA-A has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). In this study, we firstly investigated the association of gene 
variants in HLA-A and brain structures on MRI in a large sample from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to explore the effects of 
HLA-A on AD pathogenesis. We selected the hippocampus, parahippocampus, 
posterior cingulate, precuneus, middle temporal, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala 
as regions of interest (ROIs). In hybrid population analysis, our results showed 
a marginally significant association between rs9260168 and the atrophy of the 
left parahippocampus (P = 0.007, Pc = 0.054), rs3823342 and the atrophy of the 
left parahippocampus (P = 0.014, Pc = 0.054), rs76475517, which only exists in 
Caucasians with HLA-A23 or HLA-A24 alleles, and the atrophy of the right 
amygdala (P = 0.010, Pc = 0.085) at baseline. In particular, the haplotype 
(TGACAAGG), as a surrogate marker of HLA-A2, was founded to be positively 
associated with the atrophy of the right hippocampus (P = 0.047) at baseline. 
Furthermore, we detected the above four associations in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) subpopulation analysis. Our study provided preliminary 
evidences supporting HLA-A2 in Caucasians contribute to the risk of AD by 
modulating the alteration of hippocampal volume and HLA-A gene variants appear 
to play a role in altering AD-related brain structures on MRI.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. Since the 
advent of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) we have come to understand 
much about the genes involved in AD heritability and pathophysiology. Large 
case-control meta-GWAS studies have increased our ability to prioritize weaker 
effect alleles, while the recent development of network-based functional 
prediction has provided a mechanism by which we can use machine learning to 
reprioritize GWAS hits in the functional context of relevant brain tissues like 
the hippocampus and amygdala. In parallel with these developments, groups like 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have compiled rich 
compendia of AD patient data including genotype and biomarker information, 
including derived volume measures for relevant structures like the hippocampus 
and the amygdala. In this study we wanted to identify genes involved in 
AD-related atrophy of these two structures, which are often critically impaired 
over the course of the disease. To do this we developed a combined score 
prioritization method which uses the cumulative distribution function of a 
gene's functional and positional score, to prioritize top genes that not only 
segregate with disease status, but also with hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy. 
Our method identified a mix of genes that had previously been identified in AD 
GWAS including APOE, TOMM40, and NECTIN2(PVRL2) and several others that have not 
been identified in AD genetic studies, but play integral roles in AD-effected 
functional pathways including IQSEC1, PFN1, and PAK2. Our findings support the 
viability of our novel combined score as a method for prioritizing region- and 
even cell-specific AD risk genes.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal atrophy (HA) is one of the biomarkers for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To identify the best biomarkers and develop models for prediction of 
HA over 24 months using baseline data.
METHODS: The study included healthy elderly controls, subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment, and subjects with AD, obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1) and the Australian Imaging Biomarkers 
and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) databases. Predictor variables 
included cognitive and neuropsychological tests, amyloid-β, tau, and p-tau from 
cerebrospinal fluid samples, apolipoprotein E, and features extracted from 
magnetic resonance images (MRI). Least-mean-squares regression with elastic net 
regularization and least absolute deviation regression models were tested using 
cross-validation in ADNI 1. The generalizability of the models including only 
MRI features was evaluated by training the models with ADNI 1 and testing them 
with AIBL. The models including the full set of variables were not evaluated 
with AIBL because not all needed variables were available in it.
RESULTS: The models including the full set of variables performed better than 
the models including only MRI features (root-mean-square error (RMSE) 1.76-1.82 
versus 1.93-2.08). The MRI-only models performed well when applied to the 
independent validation cohort (RMSE 1.66-1.71). In the prediction of 
dichotomized HA (fast versus slow), the models achieved a reasonable prediction 
accuracy (0.79-0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: These models can potentially help identifying subjects predicted to 
have a faster HA rate. This can help in selection of suitable patients into 
clinical trials testing disease-modifying drugs for AD.

Extracellular amyloid plaques in gray matter are the earliest pathological 
marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by abnormal tau protein 
accumulation. The link between diffusion changes in gray matter, amyloid and tau 
pathology, and cognitive decline is not well understood. We first performed 
cross-sectional analyses on T1-weighted imaging, diffusion MRI, and amyloid and 
tau PETs from the ADNI 2/3 database. We evaluated cortical volume, free-water, 
fractional anisotropy (FA), and amyloid and tau SUVRs in 171 cognitively normal, 
103 MCI, and 44 AD individuals. When the 3 groups were combined, increasing 
amyloid burden was associated with reduced extracellular free-water in the 
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in those with amyloid-negative status whereas 
increasing tau burden was associated with increased extracellular free-water 
regardless of amyloid status. Next, we found that for the MCI subjects, 
diffusion measures (free-water, FA) alone predicted MMSE score 2 years later 
with a high r-square value (87%), as compared to tau SUVRs (27%), T1 volume 
(36%), and amyloid SUVRs (75%). Diffusion measures represent a potent 
non-invasive marker for predicting cognitive decline.

Hippocampal injury in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process is 
region-specific and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures of localized 
hippocampus (HP) atrophy are known to detect region-specific changes associated 
with clinical AD, but it is unclear whether these measures provide information 
that is independent of that already provided by measures of total HP volume. 
Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association between localized HP 
atrophy measures and AD-related measures including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
amyloid beta and tau concentrations, and cognitive performance, in statistical 
models that also included total HP volume as a covariate. A computational 
technique termed localized components analysis (LoCA) was used to identify 7 
independent patterns of HP atrophy among 390 semiautomatically delineated HP 
from baseline magnetic resonance imaging of participants in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Among cognitively normal participants, 
multiple measures of localized HP atrophy were significantly associated with CSF 
amyloid concentration, while total HP volume was not. In addition, among all 
participants, localized HP atrophy measures and total HP volume were both 
independently and additively associated with CSF tau concentration, performance 
on numerous neuropsychological tests, and discrimination between normal, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD clinical diagnostic groups. Together, these 
results suggest that regional measures of hippocampal atrophy provided by 
localized components analysis may be more sensitive than total HP volume to the 
effects of AD pathology burden among cognitively normal individuals and may 
provide information about HP regions whose deficits may have especially profound 
cognitive consequences throughout the AD clinical course.

Hippocampal atrophy rate-measured using automated techniques applied to 
structural MRI scans-is considered a sensitive marker of disease progression in 
Alzheimer's disease, frequently used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. 
Using publicly accessible data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI), we examined 1-year hippocampal atrophy rates generated by 
each of five automated or semiautomated hippocampal segmentation algorithms in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, or 
elderly controls. We analyzed MRI data from 398 and 62 subjects available at 
baseline and at 1 year at MRI field strengths of 1.5 T and 3 T, respectively. We 
observed a high rate of hippocampal segmentation failures across all algorithms 
and diagnostic categories, with only 50.8% of subjects at 1.5 T and 58.1% of 
subjects at 3 T passing stringent segmentation quality control. We also found 
that all algorithms identified several subjects (between 2.94% and 48.68%) 
across all diagnostic categories showing increases in hippocampal volume over 1 
year. For any given algorithm, hippocampal "growth" could not entirely be 
explained by excluding patients with flawed hippocampal segmentations, 
scan-rescan variability, or MRI field strength. Furthermore, different 
algorithms did not uniformly identify the same subjects as hippocampal 
"growers," and showed very poor concordance in estimates of magnitude of 
hippocampal volume change over time (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.319 at 
1.5 T and 0.149 at 3 T). This precluded a meaningful analysis of whether 
hippocampal "growth" represents a true biological phenomenon. Taken together, 
our findings suggest that longitudinal hippocampal volume change should be 
interpreted with considerable caution as a biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp

The sorting protein-related receptor 1 (SORL1 or LR11) gene has been verified to 
play an important role in the pathologic process of β-amyloid (Aβ) formation and 
trafficking in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by plenty of cytological and molecular 
biological studies. But there were few studies investigated the association of 
SORL1 gene and neurodegeneration features from a rather macroscopic perspective. 
In the present study, we explored the effect of SORL1 genotypes on AD-related 
brain atrophy. We recruited 812 individuals with both baseline and two-year 
follow-up information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database and applied multiple linear regression models to examine the 
association between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
neuroimaging phenotypes. Finally, four SNPs (rs11219350, rs2298813, rs3781836, 
rs3824968) showed trend of association with the volume of hippocampus and 
parahippocampal gyrus but failed to survive the false discovery rate (FDR) 
correction. Only rs1784933 and rs753780 showed significant association with 
right parahippocampal gyrus. According to our findings, SORL1 variations 
influence the atrophy of specific AD-related brain structures, which suggested 
the potential role of SORL1 in the neurodegeneration of cognitive related 
regions.

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) has been considered as a promising modifiable 
risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Nonetheless, it is still 
unclear whether age-related hearing loss associates with neurodegenerative 
biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants with ARHL were selected 
from the established Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. In multivariable models, the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations of ARHL with CSF β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau measurements, brain Aβ 
load, and cortical structural measures were explored. ARHL was associated with 
higher CSF levels of tau (p < 0.001) or ptau181 (p < 0.05) at baseline as well 
as faster elevation rates of these two types of biomarkers (p < 0.05). Although 
the baseline volume/thickness of hippocampus (p < 0.05) and entorhinal cortex (p 
< 0.0005) were higher in individuals with ARHL, these two regions (p < 0.01 for 
hippocampus, p < 0.05 for entorhinal cortex) displayed significantly accelerated 
atrophy in individuals with ARHL. No association of ARHL with CSF or brain Aβ 
levels was found. Subgroup analyses indicated that the above effects of ARHL 
were more significant in non-demented stage. Age-related hearing loss was 
associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid tau levels and atrophy of 
entorhinal cortex.

Here we describe the AddNeuroMed multicenter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
study for longitudinal assessment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study is 
similar to a faux clinical trial and has been established to assess longitudinal 
MRI changes in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control subjects 
using an image acquisition protocol compatible with the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The approach consists of a harmonized MRI 
acquisition protocol across centers, rigorous quality control, a central data 
analysis hub, and an automated image analysis pipeline. Comprehensive quality 
control measures have been established throughout the study. An intelligent 
web-accessible database holds details on both the raw images and data processed 
using a sophisticated image analysis pipeline. A total of 378 subjects were 
recruited (130 AD, 131 MCI, 117 healthy controls) of which a high percentage 
(97.3%) of the T1-weighted volumes passed the quality control criteria. 
Measurements of normalized whole brain volume, whole brain cortical thickness, 
and point-by-point group-based cortical thickness measurements, demonstrating 
the power of the automated image analysis techniques employed, are reported.

BACKGROUND: Understanding genetic influences on Alzheimer's disease (AD) may 
improve early identification. Polygenic hazard score (PHS) is associated with 
the age of AD onset and cognitive decline. It interacts with other risk factors, 
but the nature of such combined effects remains poorly understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effect of genetic risk and hippocampal 
atrophy pattern on episodic memory in a sample of older adults ranging from 
cognitively normal to those diagnosed with AD using structural MRI. Participants 
included 51 memory unimpaired normal control (NC), 69 mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and 43 AD adults enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined the main and 
interaction effects of hippocampal subfield volumes and PHS, indicating genetic 
risk for AD, on a validated episodic memory composite score. 
Diagnosis-stratified models further assessed the role of PHS.
RESULTS: Polygenic hazard score moderated the relationship between right 
fimbria/hippocampus volume ratio and episodic memory, such that patients with 
high PHS and lower volume ratio had lower episodic memory composite scores [ΔF = 
6.730, p = 0.011, ΔR 2 = 0.059]. This effect was also found among individuals 
with MCI [ΔF = 4.519, p = 0.038, ΔR 2 = 0.050]. In contrast, no interaction 
effects were present for those NC or AD individuals. A follow-up mediation 
analysis also indicated that the right fimbria/hippocampus volume ratio might 
mediate the link between PHS and episodic memory performance in the MCI group, 
whereas no mediation effects were present for those NC or AD individuals.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the interaction between AD genetic risk 
and hippocampal subfield volume ratio increases memory impairment among older 
adults. Also, the results highlighted a potential pathway in which genetic risk 
affects memory by degrading hippocampal subfield volume ratio in cognitive 
decline subjects.

Aging has been recognized as a major driving force of the Alzheimer's disease's 
(AD) progression, however, the relationship between brain aging and AD is still 
unclear. There is also a lack of studies investigating the influence of AD risk 
factors on brain aging in cognitively normal people. Here, the "Brain Age Gap 
Estimation" (BrainAGE) framework was applied to investigate the effects of AD 
risk factors on individual brain aging. Across a total of 165 cognitively normal 
elderly subjects, although no significant difference was observed in the 
BrainAGE scores among the three groups, AD risk dose (i.e., the number of AD 
risk factors) is tend to associated with an increased BrainAGE scores 
(high-risk > middle risk > low risk). Female exhibited more advanced brain aging 
(P = 0.004), and higher education years were associated with preserved brain 
aging (P < 0.001). APOE-ɛ4 (P = 0.846) and family history (FH) of dementia 
(P = 0.209) did not increase BrainAGE scores. When comparing 52 aMCI patients 
with 38 cognitively normal controls from ADNI dataset, aMCI patients showed 
significantly increased BrainAGE scores. BrainAGE scores were negatively 
correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels in the aMCI group (r = -0.275, P = 0.048). With 
an accuracy of 68.9%, BrainAGE outperformed APOE-ɛ4 and hippocampus gray matter 
volume (GMV) in predicting aMCI. In conclusion, AD is independently associated 
with structural changes in the brain that reflect advanced aging. Potentially, 
BrainAGE combined with APOE-ɛ4 and hippocampus GMV could be used as a 
pre-screening tool in early-stage AD.

BACKGROUND: Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) is a promising biomarker for 
Alzheimer disease (AD), which increases in the early stage of AD and is 
associated with the progression of AD. We performed a genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) of plasma NFL in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 
(ADNI-1) cohort to identify novel variants associated with AD.
METHODS: This study included 179 cognitively healthy controls (HC), 176 patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 172 patients with AD. All subjects 
were restricted to non-Hispanic Caucasian derived from the ADNI cohort and met 
all quality control (QC) criteria. Association of plasma NFL with the genetic 
variants was assessed using PLINK with an additive genetic model, 
i.e.dose-dependent effect of the minor alleles. The influence of a genetic 
variant associated with plasma NFL (rs7943454) on brain structure was further 
assessed using PLINK with a linear regression model.
RESULTS: The minor allele (T) of rs7943454 in leucine zipper protein 2 gene 
(LUZP2) was associated with higher plasma NFL at suggestive levels 
(P = 1.39 × 10- 6) in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the minor allele 
(G) of rs640476 near GABRB2 was associated with lower plasma NFL at suggestive 
levels (P = 6.71 × 10- 6) in a dose-dependent effect in all diagnostic groups 
except the MCI group. Furthermore, the minor allele (T) of rs7943454 within 
LUZP2 increased the onset risk of AD (odds ratio = 1.547, confidence interval 
95% = 1.018-2.351) and was associated with atrophy of right middle temporal 
gyrus in the whole cohort in the longitudinal study (P = 0.0234).
CONCLUSION: GWAS found the associations of two single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(rs7943454 and rs640476) with plasma NFL at suggestive levels. Rs7943454 in 
LUZP2 was associated with the onset risk of AD and atrophy of right middle 
temporal gyrusin the whole cohort. Using an endophenotype-based approach, we 
identified rs7943454 as a new AD risk locus.

BACKGROUND: It is increasingly evident that high blood pressure can promote 
reduction in global and regional brain volumes. While these effects may 
preferentially affect the hippocampus, reports are inconsistent.
METHODS: Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 
we examined the relationships of hippocampal volume to pulse pressure (PPR) and 
systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure according to apolipoprotein 
(APOE) ɛ4 positivity and cognitive status. The ADNI data included 1,308 
participants: Alzheimer disease (AD = 237), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI 
= 454), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI = 254), and cognitively normal (CN 
= 365), with up to 24 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Higher quartiles of PPR were significantly associated with lower 
hippocampal volumes (Q1 vs. Q4, p = 0.034) in the CN and AD groups, but with 
increasing hippocampal volume (Q1, p = 0.008; Q2, p = 0.020; Q3, p = 0.017; Q4 = 
reference) in the MCI groups. In adjusted stratified analyses among non-APOE ɛ4 
carriers, the effects in the CN (Q1 vs. Q4, p = 0.006) and EMCI groups (Q1, p = 
0.002; Q2, p = 0.013; Q3, p = 0.002; Q4 = reference) remained statistically 
significant. Also, higher DBP was significantly associated with higher 
hippocampal volume (p = 0.002) while higher SBP was significantly associated 
with decreasing hippocampal volume in the EMCI group (p = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: Changes in PPR, SBP, and DBP differentially influenced hippocampal 
volumes depending on the cognitive and APOE genotypic categories.

We investigated fluctuations in brain volume throughout the day using 
statistical modeling of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from large populations. 
We applied fully automated image analysis software to measure the brain 
parenchymal fraction (BPF), defined as the ratio of the brain parenchymal volume 
and intracranial volume, thus accounting for variations in head size. The MRI 
data came from serial scans of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in clinical 
trials (n=755, 3269 scans) and from subjects participating in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n=834, 6114 scans). The percent change in 
BPF was modeled with a linear mixed effect (LME) model, and the model was 
applied separately to the MS and ADNI datasets. The LME model for the MS 
datasets included random subject effects (intercept and slope over time) and 
fixed effects for the time-of-day, time from the baseline scan, and trial, which 
accounted for trial-related effects (for example, different inclusion criteria 
and imaging protocol). The model for ADNI additionally included the demographics 
(baseline age, sex, subject type [normal, mild cognitive impairment, or 
Alzheimer's disease], and interaction between subject type and time from 
baseline). There was a statistically significant effect of time-of-day on the 
BPF change in MS clinical trial datasets (-0.180 per day, that is, 0.180% of 
intracranial volume, p=0.019) as well as the ADNI dataset (-0.438 per day, that 
is, 0.438% of intracranial volume, p<0.0001), showing that the brain volume is 
greater in the morning. Linearly correcting the BPF values with the time-of-day 
reduced the required sample size to detect a 25% treatment effect (80% power and 
0.05 significance level) on change in brain volume from 2 time-points over a 
period of 1year by 2.6%. Our results have significant implications for future 
brain volumetric studies, suggesting that there is a potential acquisition time 
bias that should be randomized or statistically controlled to account for the 
day-to-day brain volume fluctuations.

Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogenous and 
can be classified into several subtypes. Here, we propose a robust subtyping 
method for AD based on cortical atrophy patterns and graph theory. We calculated 
similarities between subjects in their atrophy patterns throughout the whole 
brain, and clustered subjects with similar atrophy patterns using the Louvain 
method for modular organization extraction. We applied our method to AD patients 
recruited at Samsung Medical Center and externally validated our method by using 
the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method categorized very mild 
AD into three clinically distinct subtypes with high reproducibility (>90%); the 
parietal-predominant (P), medial temporal-predominant (MT), and diffuse (D) 
atrophy subtype. The P subtype showed the worst clinical presentation throughout 
the cognitive domains, while the MT and D subtypes exhibited relatively mild 
presentation. The MT subtype revealed more impaired language and executive 
function compared to the D subtype.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the clinical utility of visual ratings 
and volumetric measurements of medial temporal atrophy among subjects from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neurorimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
METHODS: A sample of 189 subjects from the ADNI, Phase 1 (ADNI-1), was chosen as 
follows: 49 cognitively normal (CN), 89 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and 50 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural MRI images were downloaded from 
the ADNI website, and a visual rating system (VRS) was used to obtain 
semi-quantitative ratings of the hippocampus (HPC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC). 
VRS ratings and FreeSurfer measures of the HPC and ERC were used to predict (i) 
baseline diagnosis and (ii) progression to AD among subjects with MCI at 
baseline.
RESULTS: VRS and FreeSurfer measures of ERC were equivalent in classifying 
subjects at baseline, but FreeSurfer measures of HPC were superior to VRS 
measures for classifying CN versus MCI subjects. VRS and FreeSurfer measures of 
both HPC and ERC were significant predictors of progression from MCI to AD. 
However, VRS ratings of ERC were superior to other MRI measures. MCI subjects 
with minimal ERC atrophy by VRS had a threefold lower progression rate to AD at 
3.2 years compared with those with mild, moderate, or severe atrophy (23% vs 
63%, 69%, and 87%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Visual ratings of HPC and ERC provide useful information to a 
physician in a clinical setting. Visual ratings of ERC may be especially useful 
in following patients with MCI.

Introduction: It has been shown that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by 
marked structural brain changes that can be detected several years before 
clinical diagnosis via structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In this 
study, we developed a structural MR-based biomarker for in vivo detection of AD 
using a supervised machine learning approach. Based on an individual's pattern 
of brain atrophy a continuous AD score is assigned which measures the similarity 
with brain atrophy patterns seen in clinical cases of AD. Methods: The 
underlying statistical model was trained with MR scans of patients and healthy 
controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1 
screening). Validation was performed within ADNI-1 and in an independent patient 
sample from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1). In addition, 
our analyses included data from a large general population sample of the Study 
of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-Trend). Results: Based on the proposed AD score we 
were able to differentiate patients from healthy controls in ADNI-1 and OASIS-1 
with an accuracy of 89% (AUC = 95%) and 87% (AUC = 93%), respectively. Moreover, 
we found the AD score to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning 
as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination in the OASIS-1 sample after 
correcting for diagnosis, age, sex, age·sex, and total intracranial volume 
(Cohen's f2 = 0.13). Additional analyses showed that the prediction accuracy of 
AD status based on both the AD score and the MMSE score is significantly higher 
than when using just one of them. In SHIP-Trend we found the AD score to be 
weakly but significantly associated with a test of verbal memory consisting of 
an immediate and a delayed word list recall (again after correcting for age, 
sex, age·sex, and total intracranial volume, Cohen's f2 = 0.009). This 
association was mainly driven by the immediate recall performance. Discussion: 
In summary, our proposed biomarker well differentiated between patients and 
healthy controls in an independent test sample. It was associated with measures 
of cognitive functioning both in a patient sample and a general population 
sample. Our approach might be useful for defining robust MR-based biomarkers for 
other neurodegenerative diseases, too.

Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and structural imaging markers are suggested as 
biomarkers amended to existing diagnostic criteria of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). But there is no clear instruction on which 
markers should be used at which stage of dementia. This study aimed to first 
investigate associations of the CSF markers as well as volumes and shapes of the 
hippocampus and lateral ventricles with MCI and AD at the baseline and secondly 
apply these baseline markers to predict MCI conversion in a two-year time using 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results 
suggested that the CSF markers, including Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau, distinguished 
MCI or AD from NC, while the Aβ42 CSF marker contributed to the differentiation 
between MCI and AD. The hippocampal shapes performed better than the hippocampal 
volumes in classifying NC and MCI, NC and AD, as well as MCI and AD. 
Interestingly, the ventricular volumes were better than the ventricular shapes 
to distinguish MCI or AD from NC, while the ventricular shapes showed better 
accuracy than the ventricular volumes in classifying MCI and AD. As the CSF 
markers and the structural markers are complementary, the combination of them 
showed great improvements in the classification accuracies of MCI and AD. 
Moreover, the combination of these markers showed high sensitivity but low 
specificity for predicting conversion from MCI to AD in two years. Hence, it is 
feasible to employ a cross-sectional sample to investigate dynamic associations 
of the CSF and imaging markers with MCI and AD and to predict future MCI 
conversion. In particular, the volumetric information may be good for the early 
stage of AD, while morphological shapes should be considered as markers in the 
prediction of MCI conversion to AD together with the CSF markers.

BACKGROUND: Genetic study of quantitative biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
is a promising method to identify novel genetic factors and relevant 
endophenotypes, which provides valuable information to deconvolute mechanistic 
complexity and better understand disease subtypes.
RESULTS: Using the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between 565,373 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 16 key AD biomarkers from 1,576 
subjects at four visits. We identified a novel locus rs5011804 at 12p12.1 
significantly associated with several AD biomarkers, including three cognitive 
traits (CDRSB, FAQ, ADAS13) and one imaging trait (fusiform volume). Additional 
mediation and interaction analyses investigated the relationships among this 
SNP, relevant biomarkers, and clinical diagnosis, confirming and further 
elaborating the genetic effects seen in the GWAS.
CONCLUSION: Our GWAS not only affirms key AD genes but also suggests the 
promising role of the SNP rs5011804 due to its associations with several AD 
cognitive and imaging outcomes. The SNP rs5011804 has a reported association 
with adult asthma and slightly affects intracranial volume but has not been 
associated with AD before. Our novel findings contribute to a more comprehensive 
view of the molecular mechanism behind AD.

Prediction of MCI-to-AD progression with atrophy-weighted standard uptake value 
ratios of (18) F-Florbetapir PET.

Fang YD, Perucho JU, Chiu SC, Lin YC, McConathy JE.

Accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD progression is an important yet challenging 
task. We introduce a new quantitative parameter: the atrophy-weighted standard 
uptake value ratio (awSUVR), defined as the PET SUVR divided by the hippocampal 
volume measured with MR, and evaluate whether it may provide better prediction 
of the MCI-to-AD progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ADNI data to evaluate the prediction performances 
of the awSUVR against SUVR. 571, 363 and 252 18-F-Florbetaipir scans were 
selected based on criteria of conversion at the third, fifth and seventh year 
after the PET scans, respectively. Corresponding MR scans were segmented with 
Freesurfer and applied on PET for SUVR and awSUVR computation. We also searched 
for the optimal combination of target and reference regions. In addition to 
evaluating the overall prediction performances, we also evaluated the prediction 
for APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. For the scans with false predictions, we 
used 18-F-Flortaucipir scans to investigate the potential source of error.
RESULTS: awSUVR provides more accurate prediction than the SUVR in all three 
progression criteria. The 5-year prediction accuracy/sensitivity/specificity is 
90/81/93% for awSUVR and 86/81/88% for SUV. awSUVR also yields good 3- and 
7-year prediction accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of 91/57/96 and 92/89/93, 
respectively. APOE4 carriers generally are slightly more difficult to predict 
for the progression. False negative prediction is found to either due to a 
near-cutoff mis-classification or potentially non-AD dementia pathology. False 
positive prediction is mainly due to the slightly delayed progression than the 
expected progression time.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated with ADNI data that 18-F-Florbetapir SUVR weighted 
with hippocampus volume may provide good prediction power with over 90% accuracy 
in MCI-to-AD progression.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the AddNeuroMed imaging framework for multi-centre 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of longitudinal changes in 
Alzheimer's disease and report on early results from the first 24 months of the 
project.
METHODS: A multi-centre study similarly to a faux clinical trial has been 
established to assess longitudinal MRI changes in Alzheimer disease (AD), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy control subjects using an image 
acquisition protocol compatible with Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI). Comprehensive quality control (QC) measures have been established 
throughout the study. An intelligent web-accessible database holds details on 
both the raw images and data processed using a sophisticated image analysis 
pipeline.
RESULTS: A total of 378 subjects have been recruited (130 AD, 131 MCI, 117 
healthy controls) of which a high percentage (97.3%) of the T1-weighted volumes 
passed the QC criteria. Measurements of normalized whole brain volume and whole 
brain cortical thickness showed significant differences between AD and controls, 
AD and MCI and MCI and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: A framework for multi-centre MRI studies of Alzheimer's disease has 
been established consisting of a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol across 
centres, rigorous QC at both the sites and central data analysis hub and an 
automated image analysis pipeline. Early results demonstrate the high quality of 
the images acquired and the applicability of the automated image analysis 
techniques employed.

INTRODUCTION: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the 
earliest Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesion in the brain. Research suggests 
differing functional roles between two EC subregions, the anterolateral EC 
(aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC).
METHODS: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness 
measurements from serial magnetic resonance imaging scans of 775 ADNI-1 
participants (219 healthy; 380 mild cognitive impairment; 176 AD) and use linear 
mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations among cortical 
thickness, disease status, and cognitive measures.
RESULTS: Group status is reliably predicted by aLEC thickness, which also 
exhibits greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. 
Change in aLEC thickness is also associated with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and 
tau levels.
DISCUSSION: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes 
over short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity-it is a 
strong candidate biomarker for detection of early AD.

We introduce a mass-univariate framework for the analysis of whole-brain 
structural trajectories using longitudinal Voxel-Based Morphometry data and 
Bayesian inference. Our approach to developmental and aging longitudinal studies 
characterizes heterogeneous structural growth/decline between and within groups. 
In particular, we propose a probabilistic generative model that parameterizes 
individual and ensemble average changes in brain structure using linear 
mixed-effects models of age and subject-specific covariates. Model inversion 
uses Expectation Maximization (EM), while voxelwise (empirical) priors on the 
size of individual differences are estimated from the data. Bayesian inference 
on individual and group trajectories is realized using Posterior Probability 
Maps (PPM). In addition to parameter inference, the framework affords 
comparisons of models with varying combinations of model order for fixed and 
random effects using model evidence. We validate the model in simulations and 
real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
project. We further demonstrate how subject specific characteristics contribute 
to individual differences in longitudinal volume changes in healthy subjects, 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

There is accumulating evidence that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene 
variants are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how they affect 
AD occurrence is still unknown. In this study, we firstly investigated the 
association of gene variants in HLA gene variants and brain structures on MRI in 
a large sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to 
explore the effects of HLA on AD pathogenesis. We selected hippocampus, 
hippocampus CA1 subregion, parahippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, 
middle temporal, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala as regions of interest (ROIs). 
According to the previous association studies of HLA variants and AD, 12 SNPs in 
HLA were identified in the dataset following quality control measures. In total 
group analysis, our results showed that TNF-α SNPs at rs2534672 and rs2395488 
were significantly positively associated with the volume of the left middle 
temporal lobe (rs2534672: P = 0.00035, Pc = 0.004; rs2395488: P = 0.0038, 
Pc = 0.023) at baseline. In the longitudinal study, HFE rs1800562 was remarkably 
correlated with the lower atrophy rate of right middle temporal lobe 
(P = 0.0003, Pc = 0.003) and RAGE rs2070600 was associated with the atrophy rate 
of right hippocampus substructure-CA1 over 2 years (P = 0.003, Pc = 0.035). 
Furthermore, we detected the above four associations in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) subgroup analysis, as well as the association of rs2534672 with 
the baseline volume of the left middle temporal lobe in normal cognition (NC) 
subgroup analysis. Our study provided preliminary evidences that HLA gene 
variants might participate in the structural alteration of AD associated brain 
regions, hence modulating the susceptibility of AD.

The aim of this study was to determine a pattern associated with longitudinal 
changes of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition during cognitively normal(CN) healthy 
aging. We used 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) PET images of the brains of 207 
cognitively normal subjects (CN1), obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to identify the healthy aging pattern and 76 
cognitively normal healthy subjects (CN2), obtained through the Xuanwu Hospital 
of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, to verify it. A voxel-based 
correlation analysis of standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) map image and age 
was conducted using the DPABI (Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging) 
software to identify the pattern. The sum of squares due to errors (SSE), 
R-square (R2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were calculated to assess 
the quality of curve fitting. Among them, R2 was proposed as the coherence 
coefficient, which was as an index to assess the correlation between SUVR value 
of the pattern and subjects' age. The pattern characterized by age-associated 
longitudinal changes of Aβ deposition was mainly distributed in the right middle 
and inferior temporal gyrus, the right temporal pole: middle temporal gyrus, the 
right inferior occipital gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus (triangular 
portion), and the right precentral gyrus. There were a significant positive 
correlation between the SUVR value of the pattern and age for each CN group 
(CN1: R2 = 0.120, p < 0.001 for quadratic model; CN2: R2 = 0.152, p = 0.002 for 
quadratic model). These findings suggest a pattern of changes in Aβ deposition 
that can be used to distinguish physiological changes from pathophysiological 
changes, constituting a new method for elucidating the neuropathological 
mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

Olfactory impairment is associated with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
is a risk factor for the development of dementia. AD pathology is known to 
disrupt brain regions instrumental in olfactory information processing, such as 
the primary olfactory cortex (POC), the hippocampus, and other temporal lobe 
structures. This selective vulnerability suggests that the functional 
connectivity (FC) between the olfactory network (ON), consisting of the POC, 
insula and orbital frontal cortex (OFC) (Tobia et al., 2016), and the 
hippocampus may be impaired in early stage AD. Yet, the development trajectory 
of this potential FC impairment remains unclear. Here, we used resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to investigate FC changes between the ON 
and hippocampus in four groups: aged-matched cognitively normal (CN), early mild 
cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD. FC 
was calculated using low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the ON and 
hippocampus (Tobia et al., 2016). We found that the FC between the ON and the 
right hippocampus became progressively disrupted across disease states, with 
significant differences between EMCI and LMCI groups. Additionally, there were 
no significant differences in gray matter hippocampal volumes between EMCI and 
LMCI groups. Lastly, the FC between the ON and hippocampus was significantly 
correlated with neuropsychological test scores, suggesting that it is related to 
cognition in a meaningful way. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence 
for the involvement of FC between the ON and hippocampus in AD pathology. 
Results suggest that functional connectivity (FC) between the olfactory network 
(ON) and hippocampus may be a sensitive marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression, preceding gray matter volume loss.

OBJECTIVES: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by arterial spin labeling (ASL) 
is a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). ASL data from multiple 
vendors were included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset. However, the M0 images were missing in Siemens ASL data, prohibiting 
CBF quantification. Here, we utilized a generative diffusion model to impute the 
missing M0 and validated generated CBF data with acquired data from GE.
METHODS: A conditional latent diffusion model was trained to generate the M0 
image and validate it on an in-house dataset (N=55) based on image similarity 
metrics, accuracy of CBF quantification, and consistency with the physical 
model. This model was then applied to the ADNI dataset (Siemens: N=211) to 
impute the missing M0 for CBF calculation. We further compared the imputed data 
(Siemens) and acquired data (GE) regarding regional CBF differences by AD 
stages, their classification accuracy for AD prediction, and CBF trajectory 
slopes estimated by a mixed effect model.
RESULTS: The trained diffusion model generated the M0 image with high fidelity 
(Structural similarity index, SSIM=0.924±0.019; peak signal-to-noise ratio, 
PSNR=33.348±1.831) and caused minimal bias in CBF values (mean difference in 
whole brain is 1.07±2.12ml/100g/min). Both generated and acquired CBF data 
showed similar differentiation patterns by AD stages, similar classification 
performance, and decreasing slopes with AD progression in specific AD-related 
regions. Generated CBF data also improved accuracy in classifying AD stages 
compared to qualitative perfusion data.
INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: This study shows the potential of diffusion models 
for imputing missing modalities for large-scale studies of CBF variation with 
AD.

Recently, much attention has been focused on the definition and structure of the 
hippocampus and its subfields, while the projections from the hippocampus have 
been relatively understudied. Here, we derive a reliable protocol for manual 
segmentation of hippocampal white matter regions (alveus, fimbria, and fornix) 
using high-resolution magnetic resonance images that are complementary to our 
previous definitions of the hippocampal subfields, both of which are freely 
available at https://github.com/cobralab/atlases. Our segmentation methods 
demonstrated high inter- and intra-rater reliability, were validated as inputs 
in automated segmentation, and were used to analyze the trajectory of these 
regions in both healthy aging (OASIS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI; using ADNI). We observed significant bilateral 
decreases in the fornix in healthy aging while the alveus and cornu ammonis (CA) 
1 were well preserved (all p's<0.006). MCI and AD demonstrated significant 
decreases in fimbriae and fornices. Many hippocampal subfields exhibited 
decreased volume in both MCI and AD, yet no significant differences were found 
between MCI and AD cohorts themselves. Our results suggest a neuroprotective or 
compensatory role for the alveus and CA1 in healthy aging and suggest that an 
improved understanding of the volumetric trajectories of these structures is 
required.

We develop a multivariate analysis of brain anatomy to identify the relevant 
shape deformation patterns and quantify the shape changes that explain 
corresponding variations in clinical neuropsychological measures. We use kernel 
Partial Least Squares (PLS) and formulate a regression model in the tangent 
space of the manifold of diffeomorphisms characterized by deformation momenta. 
The scalar deformation momenta completely encode the diffeomorphic changes in 
anatomical shape. In this model, the clinical measures are the response 
variables, while the anatomical variability is treated as the independent 
variable. To better understand the "shape-clinical response" relationship, we 
also control for demographic confounders, such as age, gender, and years of 
education in our regression model. We evaluate the proposed methodology on the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using baseline 
structural MR imaging data and neuropsychological evaluation test scores. We 
demonstrate the ability of our model to quantify the anatomical deformations in 
units of clinical response. Our results also demonstrate that the proposed 
method is generic and generates reliable shape deformations both in terms of the 
extracted patterns and the amount of shape changes. We found that while the 
hippocampus and amygdala emerge as mainly responsible for changes in test scores 
for global measures of dementia and memory function, they are not a determinant 
factor for executive function. Another critical finding was the appearance of 
thalamus and putamen as most important regions that relate to executive 
function. These resulting anatomical regions were consistent with very high 
confidence irrespective of the size of the population used in the study. This 
data-driven global analysis of brain anatomy was able to reach similar 
conclusions as other studies in Alzheimer's disease based on predefined ROIs, 
together with the identification of other new patterns of deformation. The 
proposed methodology thus holds promise for discovering new patterns of shape 
changes in the human brain that could add to our understanding of disease 
progression in neurological disorders.

It was unclear whether sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was a circulating 
biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the cross-sectional 
relationships between plasma SHBG and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in 
707 non-demented adults. Next, the influences of plasma SHBG on dynamic changes 
of CSF Aβ42, hippocampus volume, brain metabolism, and cognition were explored 
in 448 non-demented adults from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Finally, the predictive and diagnostic values of plasma SHBG in AD were 
explored. A positive correlation was found between SHBG levels in plasma and 
CSF. Individuals with higher plasma SHBG levels had lower CSF Aβ42 (p < 0.005), 
after adjusting for age, gender, education, APOE4 allele, and cognitive scores. 
Though no significant difference of plasma SHBG was observed between mild AD 
dementia and healthy normal, plasma SHBG could contribute to accelerated rates 
of CSF Aβ42 decrease (p < 0.0005), decline in brain metabolism (p < 0.05), and 
hippocampus atrophy (p < 0.01), cognitive decline (p < 0.01), as well as higher 
risk of AD dementia (p < 0.05). These findings indicated plasma SHBG could be a 
prodromal biomarker to predict disease progression in AD.

PURPOSE: Early and rapid diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has 
important clinical value in improving the prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
The hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus play crucial roles in the occurrence 
of cognitive function decline. In this study, deep learning and radiomics 
techniques were used to automatically detect MCI from healthy controls (HCs).
METHOD: This study included 115 MCI patients and 133 normal individuals with 
3D-T1 weighted MR structural images from the ADNI database. The identification 
and segmentation of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were automatically 
performed with a VB-net, and radiomics features were extracted. Relief, Minimum 
Redundancy Maximum Correlation, Recursive Feature Elimination and the minimum 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to reduce the 
dimensionality and select the optimal features. Five independent machine 
learning classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), 
Logistic Regression (LR), Bagging Decision Tree (BDT), and Gaussian Process (GP) 
were trained on the training set, and validated on the testing set to detect the 
MCI. The Delong test was used to assess the performance of different models.
RESULT: Our VB-net could automatically identify and segment the bilateral 
hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. After four steps of feature 
dimensionality reduction, the GP models based on combined features (11 features 
from the hippocampus, and 4 features from the parahippocampal gyrus) showed the 
best performance for the MCI and normal control subject discrimination. The AUC 
of the training set and test set were 0.954 (95% CI: 0.929-0.979) and 0.866 (95% 
CI: 0.757-0.976), respectively. Decision curve analysis showed that the clinical 
benefit of the line graph model was high.
CONCLUSION: The GP classifier based on 15 radiomics features of bilateral 
hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus could detect MCI from normal controls with 
high accuracy based on conventional MR images. Our fully automatic model could 
rapidly process the MRI data and give results in 1 minute, which provided 
important clinical value in assisted diagnosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by cognitive decline and atrophy in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) 
and subsequent brain regions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has 
been widely used in research and clinical care for diagnosis and monitoring AD 
progression. However, atrophy patterns are complex and vary by patient. To 
address this issue, researchers have made efforts to develop more concise 
metrics that can summarize AD-specific atrophy. Many of these methods can be 
difficult to interpret clinically, hampering adoption. In this study, we 
introduce a novel index which we call an "AD-NeuroScore," that uses a modified 
Euclidean-inspired distance function to calculate differences between regional 
brain volumes associated with cognitive decline. The index is adjusted for 
intracranial volume (ICV), age, sex, and scanner model. We validated 
AD-NeuroScore using 929 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) study, with a mean age of 72.7 years (SD = 6.3; 55.1-91.5) and 
cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD diagnoses. Our 
validation results showed that AD-NeuroScore was significantly associated with 
diagnosis and disease severity scores (measured by MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-11) at 
baseline. Furthermore, baseline AD-NeuroScore was associated with both changes 
in diagnosis and disease severity scores at all time points with available data. 
The performance of AD-NeuroScore was equivalent or superior to adjusted 
hippocampal volume (AHV), a widely used metric in AD research. Further, 
AD-NeuroScore typically performed as well as or sometimes better when compared 
to other existing sMRI-based metrics. In conclusion, we have introduced a new 
metric, AD-NeuroScore, which shows promising results in detecting AD, 
benchmarking disease severity, and predicting disease progression. AD-NeuroScore 
differentiates itself from other metrics by being clinically practical and 
interpretable.

Graphical, voxel, and region-based analysis has become a popular approach to 
studying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its 
prodromal stage [mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. These methods have been used 
previously for classification or discrimination of AD in subjects in a prodromal 
stage called stable MCI (MCIs), which does not convert to AD but remains stable 
over a period of time, and converting MCI (MCIc), which converts to AD, but the 
results reported across similar studies are often inconsistent. Furthermore, the 
classification accuracy for MCIs vs. MCIc is limited. In this study, we propose 
combining different neuroimaging modalities (sMRI, FDG-PET, AV45-PET, DTI, and 
rs-fMRI) with the apolipoprotein-E genotype to form a multimodal system for the 
discrimination of AD, and to increase the classification accuracy. Initially, we 
used two well-known analyses to extract features from each neuroimage for the 
discrimination of AD: whole-brain parcelation analysis (or region-based 
analysis), and voxel-wise analysis (or voxel-based morphometry). We also 
investigated graphical analysis (nodal and group) for all six binary 
classification groups (AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC 
vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs). Data for a total of 129 subjects (33 AD, 30 MCIs, 31 
MCIc, and 35 HCs) for each imaging modality were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage. These data also include two 
APOE genotype data points for the subjects. Moreover, we used the 2-mm AICHA 
atlas with the NiftyReg registration toolbox to extract 384 brain regions from 
each PET (FDG and AV45) and sMRI image. For the rs-fMRI images, we used the 
DPARSF toolbox in MATLAB for the automatic extraction of data and the results 
for REHO, ALFF, and fALFF. We also used the pyClusterROI script for the 
automatic parcelation of each rs-fMRI image into 200 brain regions. For the DTI 
images, we used the FSL (Version 6.0) toolbox for the extraction of fractional 
anisotropy (FA) images to calculate a tract-based spatial statistic. Moreover, 
we used the PANDA toolbox to obtain 50 white-matter-region-parcellated FA images 
on the basis of the 2-mm JHU-ICBM-labeled template atlas. To integrate the 
different modalities and different complementary information into one form, and 
to optimize the classifier, we used the multiple kernel learning (MKL) 
framework. The obtained results indicated that our multimodal approach yields a 
significant improvement in accuracy over any single modality alone. The areas 
under the curve obtained by the proposed method were 97.78, 96.94, 95.56, 96.25, 
96.67, and 96.59% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. 
MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs binary classification, respectively. Our proposed 
multimodal method improved the classification result for MCIs vs. MCIc groups 
compared with the unimodal classification results. Our study found that the 
(left/right) precentral region was present in all six binary classification 
groups (this region can be considered the most significant region). Furthermore, 
using nodal network topology, we found that FDG, AV45-PET, and rs-fMRI were the 
most important neuroimages, and showed many affected regions relative to other 
modalities. We also compared our results with recently published results.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
classify Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal 
control (NC) subjects based on images of the hippocampus region extracted from 
magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain.
METHODS: The datasets used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To segment the hippocampal region 
automatically, the patient brain MR images were matched to the International 
Consortium for Brain Mapping template (ICBM) using 3D-Slicer software. Using 
prior knowledge and anatomical annotation label information, the hippocampal 
region was automatically extracted from the brain MR images.
RESULTS: The area of the hippocampus in each image was preprocessed using local 
entropy minimization with a bi-cubic spline model (LEMS) by an inhomogeneity 
intensity correction method. To train the CNN model, we separated the dataset 
into three groups, namely AD/NC, AD/MCI, and MCI/NC. The prediction model 
achieved an accuracy of 92.3% for AD/NC, 85.6% for AD/MCI, and 78.1% for MCI/NC.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study were compared to those of previous 
studies, and summarized and analyzed to facilitate more flexible analyses based 
on additional experiments. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed 
method is highly accurate. These findings suggest that this approach is 
efficient and may be a promising strategy to obtain good AD, MCI and NC 
classification performance using small patch images of hippocampus instead of 
whole slide images.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensities are acquired in arbitrary units, 
making scans non-comparable across sites and between subjects. Intensity 
normalization is a first step for the improvement of comparability of the images 
across subjects. However, we show that unwanted inter-scan variability 
associated with imaging site, scanner effect, and other technical artifacts is 
still present after standard intensity normalization in large multi-site 
neuroimaging studies. We propose RAVEL (Removal of Artificial Voxel Effect by 
Linear regression), a tool to remove residual technical variability after 
intensity normalization. As proposed by SVA and RUV [Leek and Storey, 2007, 
2008, Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed, 2012], two batch effect correction tools largely 
used in genomics, we decompose the voxel intensities of images registered to a 
template into a biological component and an unwanted variation component. The 
unwanted variation component is estimated from a control region obtained from 
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where intensities are known to be unassociated 
with disease status and other clinical covariates. We perform a singular value 
decomposition (SVD) of the control voxels to estimate factors of unwanted 
variation. We then estimate the unwanted factors using linear regression for 
every voxel of the brain and take the residuals as the RAVEL-corrected 
intensities. We assess the performance of RAVEL using T1-weighted (T1-w) images 
from more than 900 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), as well as healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We compare RAVEL to two 
intensity-normalization-only methods: histogram matching and White Stripe. We 
show that RAVEL performs best at improving the replicability of the brain 
regions that are empirically found to be most associated with AD, and that these 
regions are significantly more present in structures impacted by AD 
(hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, enthorinal area, and fornix stria 
terminals). In addition, we show that the RAVEL-corrected intensities have the 
best performance in distinguishing between MCI subjects and healthy subjects 
using the mean hippocampal intensity (AUC=67%), a marked improvement compared to 
results from intensity normalization alone (AUC=63% and 59% for histogram 
matching and White Stripe, respectively). RAVEL is promising for many other 
imaging modalities.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) poses a major challenge as a 
neurodegenerative disorder, and early detection is critical for effective 
intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in AD research 
due to its availability and cost-effectiveness in clinical settings.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of machine 
learning (ML) methods for MRI-based biomarker selection and classification to 
investigate early cognitive decline in AD. The focus to discriminate between 
classifying healthy control (HC) participants who remained stable and those who 
developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) within five years (unstable HC or 
uHC).
METHODS: 3-Tesla (3T) MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3) were 
used, focusing on HC and uHC groups. Freesurfer's recon-all and other tools were 
used to extract anatomical biomarkers from subcortical and cortical brain 
regions. ML techniques were applied for feature selection and classification, 
using the MATLAB Classification Learner (MCL) app for initial analysis, followed 
by advanced methods such as nested cross-validation and Bayesian optimization, 
which were evaluated within a Monte Carlo replication analysis as implemented in 
our customized pipeline. Additionally, polynomial regression-based data 
harmonization techniques were used to enhance ML and statistical analysis. In 
our study, ML classifiers were evaluated using performance metrics such as 
Accuracy (Acc), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC), 
F1-score, and a normalized Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC').
RESULTS: Feature selection consistently identified biomarkers across ADNI and 
OASIS-3, with the entorhinal, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral 
orbitofrontal regions being the most affected. Classification results varied 
between balanced and imbalanced datasets and between ADNI and OASIS-3. For ADNI 
balanced datasets, the naíve Bayes model using z-score harmonization and ReliefF 
feature selection performed best (Acc = 69.17%, AROC = 77.73%, F1 = 69.21%, MCC' 
= 69.28%). For OASIS-3 balanced datasets, SVM with zscore-corrected data 
outperformed others (Acc = 66.58%, AROC = 72.01%, MCC' = 66.78%), while logistic 
regression had the best F1-score (66.68%). In imbalanced data, RUSBoost showed 
the strongest overall performance on ADNI (F1 = 50.60%, AROC = 81.54%) and 
OASIS-3 (MCC' = 63.31%). Support vector machine (SVM) excelled on ADNI in terms 
of Acc (82.93%) and MCC' (70.21%), while naïve Bayes performed best on OASIS-3 
by F1 (42.54%) and AROC (70.33%).
CONCLUSION: Data harmonization significantly improved the consistency and 
performance of feature selection and ML classification, with z-score 
harmonization yielding the best results. This study also highlights the 
importance of nested cross-validation (CV) to control overfitting and the 
potential of a semi-automatic pipeline for early AD detection using MRI, with 
future applications integrating other neuroimaging data to enhance prediction.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between MRI-derived changes in whole-brain 
and ventricular volume with change in cognitive scores in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and control subjects.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total 131 control, 231 MCI and 99 AD subjects from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort with T1-weighted 
volumetric MRIs from baseline and 12-month follow-up were used to derive volume 
changes. Mini mental state examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease assessment 
scale (ADAS)-cog and trails test changes were calculated over the same period.
RESULTS: Brain atrophy rates and ventricular enlargement differed between 
subject groups (p < 0.0005) and in MCI and AD were associated with MMSE changes. 
Both measures were additionally associated with ADAS-cog and trails-B in MCI 
patients, and ventricular expansion was associated with ADAS-cog in AD patients. 
Brain atrophy (p < 0.0005) and ventricular expansion rates (p = 0.001) were 
higher in MCI subjects who progressed to AD within 12 months of follow-up 
compared with MCI subjects who remained stable. MCI subjects who progressed to 
AD within 12 months had similar atrophy rates to AD subjects.
CONCLUSION: Whole-brain atrophy rates and ventricular enlargement differed 
between patient groups and healthy controls, and tracked disease progression and 
psychological decline, demonstrating their relevance as biomarkers.

While strong cross-sectional evidence supported the use of fornix microstructure 
as a marker for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD), longitudinal data remains 
inconclusive on the sequential nature of fornix microstructure abnormalities and 
AD progression. An unequivocal longitudinal relationship between fornix 
microstructure and markers of AD progression -memory impairment and hippocampal 
atrophy, must be established to validate fornix microstructure as a marker of AD 
progression. We included 115 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative across the non-demented AD spectrum- defined as those 
who had at least one AD risk marker at baseline (e.g., mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) due to AD diagnosis, amyloid or ApoE4 positivity) and/or 'cognitively 
normal individuals who converted to MCI due to AD or AD, with structural and 
diffusion tensor imaging scans at baseline and two years follow-up. Hippocampal 
volumes (HV), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the fornix 
were extracted. Memory was indexed via composite scores of verbal memory tests. 
Structural equation models tested the bidirectional cross-lagged effects of 
fornix microstructure, memory, and HV. Impaired memory and smaller HV at 
baseline significantly predicted worse fornix microstructure (decreased FA and 
increased MD) two years later. Baseline fornix microstructure was not associated 
with subsequent changes in memory and HV. Fornix microstructure is compromised 
likely at a later stage, where significant decline in memory and hippocampal 
atrophy have occurred. This limits the utility of fornix microstructure in the 
early detection of AD. Our findings inform the possible pathophysiology and 
refined the use of AD neural markers.

Hippocampus Segmentation Based on Iterative Local Linear Mapping With 
Representative and Local Structure-Preserved Feature Embedding.

Pang S, Lu Z, Jiang J, Zhao L, Lin L, Li X, Lian T, Huang M, Yang W, Feng Q.

Hippocampus segmentation plays a significant role in mental disease diagnoses, 
such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and so on. Patch-based multi-atlas 
segmentation (PBMAS) approach is a popular method for hippocampus segmentation 
and has achieved a promising result. However, the PBMAS approach needs high 
computation cost due to registration and the segmentation accuracy is subject to 
the registration accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on 
iterative local linear mapping (ILLM) with the representative and local 
structure-preserved feature embedding to achieve accurate and robust hippocampus 
segmentation with no need for registration. In the proposed approach, 
semi-supervised deep autoencoder (SSDA) exploits unsupervised deep autoencoder 
and local structure-preserved manifold regularization to nonlinearly transform 
the extracted magnetic resonance (MR) patch to embedded feature manifold, whose 
adjacent relationship is similar to the signed distance map (SDM) patch 
manifold. Local linear mapping is used to preliminarily predict SDM patch 
corresponding to the MR patch. Subsequently, threshold segmentation generates a 
preliminary segmentation. The ILLM refines the segmentation result iteratively 
by ensuring the local constraints of embedded feature manifold and SDM patch 
manifold using a space-constrained dictionary update. Thus, a refined 
segmentation is obtained with no need for registration. The experiments on 135 
subjects from ADNI dataset show that the proposed approach is superior to the 
state-of-the-art PBMAS and classification-based approaches with mean Dice 
similarity coefficients of 0.8852±0.0203 and 0.8783 ± 0.0251 for bilateral 
hippocampus segmentation of 1.5T and 3.0T datasets, respectively.

We aimed to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated with 
neurodegeneration in individuals with and without CSF evidence of Alzheimer 
pathology. We investigated 287 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) subjects (age=74.9±6.9; 22/48/30% with Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive 
impairment/controls) with CSF multiplex analyte data and serial volumetric MRI. 
We calculated brain and hippocampal atrophy rates, ventricular expansion and 
Mini Mental State Examination decline. We used false discovery rate corrected 
regression analyses to assess associations between CSF variables and atrophy 
rates in individuals with and without amyloid pathology, adjusting in stages for 
tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age, sex, ApoE4 status and diagnosis. Analytes 
showing statistically significant independent relationships were entered into 
reverse stepwise analyses. Adjusting for tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age, sex 
and ApoE4, 4/83 analytes were significantly independently associated with brain 
atrophy rate, 1/83 with ventricular expansion and 2/83 with hippocampal atrophy. 
The strongest CSF predictor for the three atrophy measures was low trefoil 
factor 3 (TFF3). High cystatin C (CysC) was associated with higher whole brain 
atrophy and hippocampal atrophy rates. Lower levels of vascular endothelial 
growth factor and chromogranin A (CrA) were associated with higher whole brain 
atrophy. In exploratory reverse stepwise analyses, lower TFF3 was associated 
with higher rates of whole brain, hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion. 
Lower levels of CrA were associated with higher whole brain atrophy rate. The 
relationship between low TFF3 and increased hippocampal atrophy rate remained 
after adjustment for diagnosis. We identified a series of CSF markers that are 
independently associated with rate of neurodegeneration in amyloid-positive 
individuals. TFF3, a substrate for NOTCH processing may be an important 
biomarker of neurodegeneration across the Alzheimer spectrum.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) into plaques, aggregation of tau into neurofibrillary tangles, 
and neurodegenerative processes including atrophy. However, there is a poorly 
understood spatial discordance between initial Aβ deposition and local 
neurodegeneration.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we test the hypothesis that the cingulum bundle links Aβ 
deposition in the cingulate cortex to medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy.
METHODS: 21 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the UMC 
Utrecht memory clinic (UMCU, discovery sample) and 37 participants with MCI from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, replication sample) with 
available Aβ-PET scan, T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI were included. Aβ 
load of the cingulate cortex was measured by the standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR), white matter integrity of the cingulum bundle was assessed by mean 
diffusivity and atrophy of the MTL by normalized MTL volume. Relationships were 
tested with linear mixed models, to accommodate multiple measures for each 
participant.
RESULTS: We found at most a weak association between cingulate Aβ and MTL volume 
(added R2 &lt;0.06), primarily for the posterior hippocampus. In neither sample, 
white matter integrity of the cingulum bundle was associated with cingulate Aβ 
or MTL volume (added R2 &lt;0.01). Various sensitivity analyses (Aβ-positive 
individuals only, posterior cingulate SUVR, MTL sub region volume) provided 
similar results.
CONCLUSION: These findings, consistent in two independent cohorts, do not 
support our hypothesis that loss of white matter integrity of the cingulum is a 
connecting factor between cingulate gyrus Aβ deposition and MTL atrophy.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a common type of dementia, affecting human memory, 
language ability and behavior. Hippocampus is an important biomarker for AD 
diagnosis. Previous hippocampus-based biomarker analyses mainly focused on 
volume, texture and shape of the bilateral hippocampus. 3D convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) can understand and extract complex morphology features from 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and have recently been developed for 
hippocampus-based AD classification. However, existing CNN models often have 
highly complex structures and require large amounts of training data. Here we 
propose an accurate and lightweight Densely Connected 3D convolutional neural 
network (DenseCNN) for AD classification based on hippocampus segments. DenseCNN 
was trained on 746 and tested on 187 pairs of hippocampus from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) databases. DenseCNN has an average 
accuracy of 0.898, sensitivity of 0.985, specificity of 0.852, and area under 
curve (A UC) of0.979, which are better than or comparable to state-of-art 
approaches.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal tau proteins are independent contributors to cognitive 
impairment. Nevertheless, not all individuals exposed to high-level tau 
pathology will develop cognitive dysfunction. We aimed to construct a model to 
predict cognitive trajectory for this high-risk population.
METHOD: Longitudinal data of 181 non-demented adults (mean age= 73.1; female= 
45%), who were determined to have high cerebral burden of abnormal tau by 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of phosphorylated tau (ptau181) or total 
tau, were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Cognitive decline was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination scores 
decline ≥ 3 over three years. A predictive nomogram was constructed using 
stepwise backward regression method. The discrimination, calibration, and 
clinical usefulness of the nomogram were evaluated. The model was validated in 
another 189 non-demented adults via a cross-sectional set (n=149, mean age = 
73.9, female = 51%) and a longitudinal set (n= 40, mean age = 75, female = 48%). 
Finally, the relationships of the calculated risk scores with cognitive decline 
and risk of Alzheimer's disease were examined during an extended 8-year 
follow-up.
RESULT: Lower volume of hippocampus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, p< 0.001), lower 
levels of CSF sTREM2 (OR = 0.76, p = 0.003), higher scores of Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (OR = 1.15, p = 0.001) and Functional 
Activities Questionnaire (OR = 1.16, p = 0.016), and number of APOE ε4 (OR = 
1.88, p = 0.039) were associated with higher risk of cognitive decline 
independent of the amyloid status and were included in the final model. The 
nomogram had an area of under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 for training set, 0.93 
for cross-sectional validation set, and 0.91 for longitudinal validation set. 
Over the 8-year follow-up, the high-risk group exhibited faster cognitive 
decline (p< 0.001) and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia (HR= 
6.21, 95% CI= 3.61-10.66, p< 0.001 ).
CONCLUSION: APOE ε4 status, brain reserve capability, neuroinflammatory marker, 
and neuropsychological scores can help predict cognitive decline in non-demented 
adults with high burden of tau pathology, independent of the presence of amyloid 
pathology.

Multivariate pattern analysis techniques have been increasingly used over the 
past decade to derive highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of diseases on an 
individual basis. The driving assumption behind the vast majority of the 
existing methodologies is that a single imaging pattern can distinguish between 
healthy and diseased populations, or between two subgroups of patients (e.g., 
progressors vs. non-progressors). This assumption effectively ignores the ample 
evidence for the heterogeneous nature of brain diseases. Neurodegenerative, 
neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are largely characterized by 
high clinical heterogeneity, which likely stems in part from underlying 
neuroanatomical heterogeneity of various pathologies. Detecting and 
characterizing heterogeneity may deepen our understanding of disease mechanisms 
and lead to patient-specific treatments. However, few approaches tackle disease 
subtype discovery in a principled machine learning framework. To address this 
challenge, we present a novel non-linear learning algorithm for simultaneous 
binary classification and subtype identification, termed HYDRA (Heterogeneity 
through Discriminative Analysis). Neuroanatomical subtypes are effectively 
captured by multiple linear hyperplanes, which form a convex polytope that 
separates two groups (e.g., healthy controls from pathologic samples); each face 
of this polytope effectively defines a disease subtype. We validated HYDRA on 
simulated and clinical data. In the latter case, we applied the proposed method 
independently to the imaging and genetic datasets of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1) study. The imaging dataset consisted of 
T1-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance images of 123 AD patients and 177 
controls. The genetic dataset consisted of single nucleotide polymorphism 
information of 103 AD patients and 139 controls. We identified 3 reproducible 
subtypes of atrophy in AD relative to controls: (1) diffuse and extensive 
atrophy, (2) precuneus and extensive temporal lobe atrophy, as well some 
prefrontal atrophy, (3) atrophy pattern very much confined to the hippocampus 
and the medial temporal lobe. The genetics dataset yielded two subtypes of AD 
characterized mainly by the presence/absence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 
genotype, but also involving differential presence of risk alleles of CD2AP, 
SPON1 and LOC39095 SNPs that were associated with differences in the respective 
patterns of brain atrophy, especially in the precuneus. The results demonstrate 
the potential of the proposed approach to map disease heterogeneity in 
neuroimaging and genetic studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a severe 
neurodegenerative disorder. Identifying biomarkers that can track the progress 
of the disease has recently received increasing attentions in AD research. An 
accurate prediction of disease progression would facilitate optimal 
decision-making for clinicians and patients. A definitive diagnosis of AD 
requires autopsy confirmation, thus many clinical/cognitive measures including 
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 
cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) have been designed to evaluate the cognitive 
status of the patients and used as important criteria for clinical diagnosis of 
probable AD. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting disease 
progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting biomarkers predictive 
of the progression. Specifically, we formulate the prediction problem as a 
multi-task regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point 
as a task and propose two novel multi-task learning formulations. We have 
performed extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we use the baseline MRI features 
to predict MMSE/ADAS-Cog scores in the next 4 years. Results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed multi-task learning formulations for disease 
progression in comparison with single-task learning algorithms including ridge 
regression and Lasso. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to 
identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression. 
We observe that cortical thickness average of left middle temporal, cortical 
thickness average of left and right Entorhinal, and white matter volume of left 
Hippocampus play significant roles in predicting ADAS-Cog at all time points. We 
also observe that several MRI biomarkers provide significant information for 
predicting MMSE scores for the first 2 years, however very few are shown to be 
significant in predicting MMSE score at later stages. The lack of predictable 
MRI biomarkers in later stages may contribute to the lower prediction 
performance of MMSE than that of ADAS-Cog in our study and other related 
studies.

Measures of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentrations in 
cerebrospinal fluid are extensively used for diagnostic and research purposes in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) as correlates of cortical thinning and cognitive 
outcomes. The present study investigated the relationship of Aβ and p-tau with 
hippocampal subfield volumes Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1-4, dentate gyrus (DG), and 
subiculum. Subfields were segmented from T1-weighted images from the 
ADNI-population using FreeSurfer v6. Linear and polynomial regression models 
revealed distinct associations of Aβ and p-tau with subfield volumes. Aβ had a 
quadratic relationship with all hippocampal subfield volumes and the inflection 
point was higher than the validated cut-off for Aβ. For p-tau the relationships 
were linear, except for CA3, in which it was quadratic. For the CA1 and CA3, 
these quadratic relationships with Aβ were only observed when p-tau was low. 
Amyloid and p-tau contributed equally to the explained variance in CA4 and DG 
volume. Subicular volume was best explained by Aβ alone. These biomarker 
relationships with hippocampal subfield volumes seem to mirror the 
hippocampal-specific topography of Aβ and tau reported in neuropathological 
staging models. In addition, using continuous values of Aβ reveals positive 
patterns with imaging markers for individuals around the positivity threshold 
that would be masked when using dichotomized biomarker groups, which can be 
important for early detection and accurate inclusion of potential participants 
at risk for AD in clinical trials.

Spatial association between distributed β-amyloid and tau varies with cognition.

Carbonell F, McNicoll C, Zijdenbos AP, Bedell BJ; Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative.

Several PET studies have explored the relationship between β-amyloid load and 
tau uptake at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Most of 
these studies have focused on the linear relationship between β-amyloid and tau 
at the local level and their synergistic effect on different AD biomarkers. We 
hypothesize that patterns of spatial association between β-amyloid and tau might 
be uncovered using alternative association metrics that account for linear as 
well as more complex, possible nonlinear dependencies. In the present study, we 
propose a new Canonical Distance Correlation Analysis (CDCA) to generate 
distinctive spatial patterns of the cross-correlation structure between tau, as 
measured by [18F]flortaucipir PET, and β-amyloid, as measured by 
[18F]florbetapir PET, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) study. We found that the CDCA-based β-amyloid scores were not only 
maximally distance-correlated to tau in cognitively normal (CN) controls and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but also differentiated between low and high 
levels of β-amyloid uptake. The most distinctive spatial association pattern was 
characterized by a spread of β-amyloid covering large areas of the cortex and 
localized tau in the entorhinal cortex. More importantly, this spatial 
dependency varies according to cognition, which cannot be explained by the 
uptake differences in β-amyloid or tau between CN and MCI subjects. Hence, the 
CDCA-based scores might be more accurate than the amyloid or tau SUVR for the 
enrollment in clinical trials of those individuals on the path of cognitive 
deterioration.

BACKGROUND: An international Delphi panel has defined a harmonized protocol 
(HarP) for the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on MR. The aim of this 
study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, 
and its major sources of variance.
METHODS: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, 
qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and 
resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP 
to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T.
RESULTS: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols 
(absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute 
left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement 
within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers 
(left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to 
different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to 
scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), 
field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy 
(33.5%, P < .001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local 
segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers. 
Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference for the 
qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation algorithms.

The ability to pool data from multiple MRI scanners is becoming increasingly 
important with the influx in multi-site research studies. Fast spin echo (FSE) 
dual spin echo sequences are often chosen for such studies based principally on 
their short acquisition time and the clinically useful contrasts they provide 
for assessing gross pathology. The practicality of measuring FSE-T2 relaxation 
properties has rarely been assessed. Here, FSE-T2 relaxation properties are 
examined across the three main scanner vendors (General Electric (GE), Philips, 
and Siemens). The American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom was scanned on 
four 1.5T platforms (two GE, one Philips, and one Siemens) to determine if the 
dual echo pulse sequence is susceptible to vendor-based variance. In addition, 
data from 85 subjects spanning the spectrum of normal aging, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) was obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to affirm the presence of any phantom 
based between vendor variance and determine the relationship between this 
variance and disease. FSE-T2 relaxation properties, including peak FSE-T2 and 
histogram width, were calculated for each phantom and human subject. Direct 
correspondence was found between the phantom and human subject data. Peak FSE-T2 
of Siemens scanners was consistently at least 20ms prolonged compared to GE and 
Philips. Siemens scanners showed broader FSE-T2 histograms than the other 
scanners. Greater variance was observed across GE scanners than either Philips 
or Siemens. FSE-T2 differences were much greater with scanner vendor than 
between diagnostic groups, as no significant changes in peak FSE-T2 or histogram 
width between normal aged, MCI, and AD subject groups were observed. These 
results indicate that whole brain histogram measures are not sensitive enough to 
detect FSE-T2 changes between normal aging, MCI, and AD and that FSE-T2 is 
highly variable across scanner vendors.

A genome-wide, whole brain approach to investigate genetic effects on 
neuroimaging phenotypes for identifying quantitative trait loci is described. 
The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and genetic dataset 
was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer parcellation 
followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). One hundred forty-two 
measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were 
extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each 
phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 
620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 
AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC). 
Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and 
associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p<10(-7) and 
p<10(-6)). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as 
markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were 
proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes. Detailed image analyses of 
rs6463843 (flanking NXPH1) revealed reduced global and regional GM density 
across diagnostic groups in TT relative to GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis 
indicated that AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential 
vulnerability to right hippocampal GM density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein 
implicated in promotion of adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in 
synaptic integrity, the loss of which is a hallmark of AD. A genome-wide, whole 
brain search strategy has the potential to reveal novel candidate genes and loci 
warranting further investigation and replication.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows a characteristic pattern of 
brain atrophy, with predominant involvement of posterior limbic structures, and 
relative preservation of rostral limbic and primary cortical regions. We aimed 
to investigate the diagnostic utility of two gray matter volume ratios based on 
this pattern, and to develop a fully automated method to calculate them from 
unprocessed MRI files.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 118 subjects from the ADNI 
database, including normal controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and AD. Clinical variables and 3T T1-weighted MRI files were analyzed. 
Regional gray matter and total intracranial volumes were calculated with a shell 
script (gm_extractor) based on FSL. Anteroposterior and primary-to-posterior 
limbic ratios (APL and PPL) were calculated from these values. Diagnostic 
utility of variables was tested in logistic regression models using Bayesian 
model averaging for variable selection. External validity was evaluated with 
bootstrap sampling and a test set of 60 subjects.
RESULTS: gm_extractor showed high test-retest reliability and high concurrent 
validity with FSL's FIRST. Volumetric measurements agreed with the expected 
anatomical pattern associated with AD. APL and PPL ratios were significantly 
different between groups, and were selected instead of hippocampal and 
entorhinal volumes to differentiate normal from MCI or cognitively impaired (MCI 
plus AD) subjects.
CONCLUSION: APL and PPL ratios may be useful components of models aimed to 
differentiate normal subjects from patients with MCI or AD. These values, and 
other gray matter volumes, may be reliably calculated with gm_extractor.

BACKGROUND: The North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(NA-ADNI) was the first program to develop standardized procedures for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarker collection.
OBJECTIVE: We describe the validation of acquisition and processing of 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in different Italian academic AD 
clinics following NA-ADNI procedures.
METHODS: 373 patients with subjective memory impairment (n = 12), mild cognitive 
impairment (n = 92), Alzheimer's dementia (n = 253), and frontotemporal dementia 
(n = 16) were enrolled in 9 Italian centers. 22 cognitively healthy elderly 
controls were also included. MRI site qualification and MP-RAGE quality 
assessment was applied following the NA-ADNI procedures. Indices of validity 
were: (i) NA-ADNI phantom's signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio, (ii) 
proportion of images passing quality control, (iii) comparability of automated 
intracranial volume (ICV) estimates across scanners, and (iv) known-group 
validity of manual hippocampal volumetry.
RESULTS: Results on Phantom and Volunteers scans showed that I-ADNI acquisition 
parameters were comparable with those one of the ranked-A ADNI scans. 
Eighty-seven percent of I-ADNI MPRAGE images were ranked of high quality in 
comparison of 69% of NA-ADNI. ICV showed homogeneous variances across scanners 
except for Siemens scanners at 3.0 Tesla (p = 0.039). A significant difference 
in hippocampal volume was found between AD and controls on 1.5 Tesla scans (p < 
0.001), confirming known group validity test.
CONCLUSION: This study has provided standardization of MRI acquisition and 
imaging marker collection across different Italian clinical units and equipment. 
This is a mandatory step to the implementation of imaging biomarkers in clinical 
routine for early and differential diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly associated with slowly 
progressive hippocampal atrophy. Elucidating the relationships between local 
morphometric changes and disease status for early diagnosis could be aided by 
machine learning algorithms trained on neuroimaging datasets.
OBJECTIVE: This study intended to propose machine learning models for the 
accurate identification and cognitive function prediction across the AD severity 
spectrum based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) of the bilateral 
hippocampi.
METHODS: The high-resolution sMRI data of 120 AD dementia patients, 232 amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 206 healthy controls (HCs) were 
included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The 
classification capacity and cognitive predict ability of hippocampal volume was 
evaluated by multiple pattern analysis using the support vector machine (SVM) 
and relevance vector regression (RVR) application of the Pattern Recognition for 
Neuroimaging Toolbox, separately. For validation, the analyses were performed 
using a biomarker-based regrouping method and another independent local dataset.
RESULTS: The SVM application produced a total accuracy of 94.17%, 80.85%, and 
70.74% and area under receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.97, 0.87, 
and 0.72 between HC versus AD dementia, HC versus aMCI, and aMCI versus AD 
dementia classification, respectively. The RVR application significantly 
predicted the baseline and mean cognitive function at three years of follow-up. 
Qualitatively consistent results were obtained using different regrouping method 
and the local dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning methods based on the bilateral hippocampi 
distinguished across the AD severity spectrum and predicted the baseline and the 
longitudinal cognitive function with greater accuracy.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is a serious health 
problem. The disease is expected to increase further in the upcoming years with 
the increase of the elderly population. Developing new treatments and diagnostic 
methods is getting more important. In this study, we focused on the early 
diagnosis of dementia in Alzheimer's disease via analysis of neuroimages. We 
analyzed the data diagnosed by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) protocol. The analyzed data were T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 
159 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 217 patients with mild cognitive 
impairment and 109 cognitively healthy older people. In this study, we propose 
that the volumetric reduction in the hippocampus is the most important indicator 
of Alzheimer's disease. There is not much research about the relationship 
between the volumetric reduction in the hippocampus and Alzheimer's disease. 
This volume information was calculated through semi-automatic segmentation 
software ITK-SNAP and a data set was created based on age, gender, diagnosis, 
and right and left hippocampal volume values. The diagnosis via hippocampal 
volume information was made by using machine learning techniques. By using this 
approach, we conclude that brain MRIs can be used to distinguish the patients 
with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Cognitive 
Normal (CN) from each other; while most of the studies were only able to 
distinguish AD from CN. Our results have revealed that our approach improves the 
performance of the computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Accurate detection of the regions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions is 
critical for early intervention to effectively slow down the progression of the 
disease. Although gray matter volumetric abnormalities are commonly detected in 
patients with mild cognition impairment (MCI) and patients with AD, the gray 
matter surface-based deterioration pattern associated with the progression of 
the disease from MCI to AD stages is largely unknown. To identify group 
differences in gray matter surface morphometry, including cortical thickness, 
the gyrification index (GI), and the sulcus depth, 80 subjects from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were split into 
healthy controls (HCs; N = 20), early MCIs (EMCI; N = 20), late MCIs (LMCI; N = 
20), and ADs (N = 20). Regions-of-interest (ROI)-based surface morphometry was 
subsequently studied and compared across the four stage groups to characterize 
the gray matter deterioration during AD progression. Co-alteration patterns 
(Spearman's correlation coefficient) across the whole brain were also examined. 
Results showed that patients with MCI and AD exhibited a significant reduction 
in cortical thickness (p < 0.001) mainly in the cingulate region (four 
subregions) and in the temporal (thirteen subregions), parietal (five 
subregions), and frontal (six subregions) lobes compared to HCs. The sulcus 
depth of the eight temporal, four frontal, four occipital, and eight parietal 
subregions were also significantly affected (p < 0.001) by the progression of 
AD. The GI was shown to be insensitive to AD progression (only three subregions 
were detected with a significant difference, p < 0.001). Moreover, Spearman's 
correlation analysis confirmed that the co-alteration pattern of the cortical 
thickness and sulcus depth indices is predominant during AD progression. The 
findings highlight the relevance between gray matter surface morphometry and the 
stages of AD, laying the foundation for in vivo tracking of AD progression. The 
co-alteration pattern of surface-based morphometry would improve the 
researchers' knowledge of the underlying pathologic mechanisms in AD.

AIMS: To prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD) from progressing to dementia, early 
prediction and classification of AD are important and they play a crucial role 
in medical image analysis.
BACKGROUND: In this study, we employed a transfer learning technique to classify 
magnetic resonance (MR) images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network 
(CNN).
OBJECTIVE: To address the early diagnosis of AD, we employed a computer-assisted 
technique, specifically the deep learning (DL) model, to detect AD.
METHODS: In particular, we classified Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC) subjects using whole slide 
two-dimensional (2D) images. To illustrate this approach, we made use of 
state-of-the-art CNN base models, i.e., the residual networks Res- Net-101, 
ResNet-50, and ResNet-18, and compared their effectiveness in identifying AD. To 
evaluate this approach, an AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset was 
utilized. We also showed uniqueness by using MR images selected only from the 
central slice containing left and right hippocampus regions to evaluate the 
models.
RESULTS: All three models used randomly split data in the ratio of 70:30 for 
training and testing. Among the three, ResNet-101 showed 98.37% accuracy, better 
than the other two ResNet models, and performed well in multiclass 
classification. The promising results emphasize the benefit of using transfer 
learning, specifically when the dataset is low.
CONCLUSION: From this study, we know that transfer learning helps to overcome DL 
problems mainly when the data available is insufficient to train a model from 
scratch. This approach is highly advantageous in medical image analysis to 
diagnose diseases like AD.

INTRODUCTION: This study reports a novel deep learning approach to predict mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) within three 
years using whole-brain fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography 
(PET) and cognitive scores (CS).
METHODS: This analysis consisted of 150 normal controls (CN), 257 MCI, and 205  
AD subjects from ADNI. FDG-PET and CS were obtained at MCI diagnosis to predict 
AD conversion within three years of MCI diagnosis using convolutional neural 
networks.
RESULTS: Neurocognitive scores predicted better than FDG-PET per se, but the 
best model was a combination of FDG-PET, age, and neurocognitive data, yielding 
an AUC of 0.785 ± 0.096 and a balanced accuracy of 0.733 ± 0.098. Saliency maps 
highlighted putamen, thalamus, inferior frontal gyrus, parietal operculum, 
precuneus cortices, calcarine cortices, temporal gyrus, and planum temporale to 
be important for prediction.
DISCUSSION: Deep learning accurately predicts MCI conversion to AD and provides 
neural correlates of brain regions associated with AD conversion.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most dominant type of dementia that 
has not been treated completely yet. Few Alzheimer's patients are correctly 
diagnosed on time. Therefore, diagnostic tools are needed for better and more 
efficient diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an efficient automated method to 
differentiate Alzheimer's patients from normal elderly and present the essential 
features with accurate Alzheimer's diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this analytical study, 154 Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) scans were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, preprocessed, and normalized by the head size for extracting 
features (volume, cortical thickness, Sulci depth, and Gyrification Index 
Features (GIF). Relief-F algorithm, t-test, and one way-ANOVA were used for 
feature ranking to obtain the most effective features representing the AD for 
the classification process. Finally, in the classification step, four 
classifiers were used with 10 folds cross-validation as follows: Gaussian 
Support Vector Machine (GSVM), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Weighted 
K-Nearest Neighbors (W-KNN), and Decision Tree algorithm.
RESULTS: The LSVM classifier and W-KNN produce a testing accuracy of 100% with 
only seven features. Additionally, GSVM and decision tree produce a testing 
accuracy of 97.83% and 93.48%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The proposed system represents an automatic and highly accurate AD 
detection with a few reliable and effective features and minimum time.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the hippocampus during its progression, but the 
specific observable changes of hippocampal subfields during disease progression 
remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed an event-based model (EBM) 
to determine the sequence of occurrence of hippocampal subfield atrophy in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD cohorts. Subjects (207) were included: 86 MCI, 
53 AD, and 68 healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans to analyse the hippocampal subfields. We assigned each patient to a 
specific EBM stage, based on the number of their abnormal subfields. A 
combination of 2-year follow-up MRI scans were applied to demonstrate the 
longitudinal consistency and utility of the model's staging system. The model 
estimated that the earliest atrophy occurs in the hippocampal fissure, then 
spreading to other subregions in both MCI and AD. We identified a marked 
divergence between the sequences of left and right hippocampal subfields 
atrophy, so inter-hemispheric asymmetry pattern was further analysed. The 
sequence of asymmetry index (AI) increases beginning in the molecular and 
granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), cornus ammonis (CA) 4, and 
the molecular layer (ML). Longitudinal analysis confirms the efficacy of the 
model. In addition, the model stages were significantly correlated with 
patients' memory scores (p < .05). Collectively, we used a data-driven method to 
provide new insight into AD hippocampal progression. The present model could aid 
in understanding of the disease stages, as well as tracking memory decline.

IMPORTANCE: Tau accumulation in Alzheimer disease (AD) is closely associated 
with cognitive impairment. Quantitating tau accumulation by positron emission 
tomography (PET) will be a useful outcome measure for future clinical trials in 
the AD spectrum.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of β-amyloid (Aβ) on PET with 
subsequent tau accumulation on PET in persons who were cognitively unimpaired 
(CU) to gain insight into temporal associations between Aβ and tau accumulation 
and inform clinical trial design.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included individuals aged 
65 to 85 years who were CU and had participated in the Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging, with serial cognitive assessments, serial magnetic resonance imaging, 
11C-Pittsburgh compound B (Aβ) PET scans, and 18F-flortaucipir PET scans, 
collected from May 2015 to March 2020. Persons were excluded if they lacked 
follow-up PET scans. A similarly evaluated CU group from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were also studied. These data were collected from 
September 2015 to March 2020.
EXPOSURES: Participants were stratified by index Aβ levels on PET into low Aβ 
(≤8 centiloid [CL]), subthreshold Aβ (9-21 CL), suprathreshold Aβ (22-67 CL), 
and high Aβ (≥68 CL).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes over a mean of 2.7 (range, 1.1-4.1) years in 
flortaucipir PET in entorhinal, inferior temporal, and lateral parietal regions 
of interest and an AD meta-region of interest (ROI).
RESULTS: A total of 167 people were included (mean age, 74 [range, 65-85] years; 
75 women [44.9%]); 101 individuals were excluded lacking follow-up, and 114 
individuals from the ADNI were also studied (mean [SD] age, 74.14 [5.29] years; 
64 women [56.1%]). In the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, longitudinal flortaucipir 
accumulation rates in the high Aβ group were greater than the suprathreshold, 
subthreshold, and low Aβ groups in the entorhinal ROI (suprathreshold, 0.025 
[95% CI, 0.013-0.037] standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] units; 
subthreshold, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.014-0.037] SUVR units; low Aβ, 0.034 [95% CI, 
0.02-0.049] SUVR units), inferior temporal ROI (suprathreshold, 0.025 [95% CI, 
0.014-0.035] SUVR units; subthreshold, 0.027 [95% CI, 0.017-0.037] SUVR units; 
low Aβ, 0.035 [95% CI, 0.022-0.047] SUVR units), and the AD meta-ROI 
(suprathreshold, 0.023 [95% CI, 0.013-0.032] SUVR units; subthreshold, 0.025 
[95% CI, 0.016-0.034] SUVR units; low Aβ, 0.032 [95% CI, 0.021-0.043] SUVR 
units) (all P < .001). Flortaucipir accumulation rates in the subthreshold and 
suprathreshold Aβ groups in temporal regions were nonsignificantly elevated 
compared with the low Aβ group. In the ADNI cohort, the variance was larger than 
in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging but point estimates for annualized 
flortaucipir accumulation in the inferior temporal ROI were very similar. An 
estimated 216 participants who were CU per group with PET Aβ of 68 CL or more 
would be needed to detect a 25% annualized reduction in flortaucipir 
accumulation rate in the AD meta-ROI with 80% power.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Substantial flortaucipir accumulation in temporal 
regions is greatest in persons aged 65 to 85 years who were CU and had high 
initial Aβ PET levels, compared with those with lower Aβ levels. Recruiting 
persons who were CU and exhibiting Aβ of 68 CL or more on an index Aβ PET is a 
feasible strategy to recruit for clinical trials in which a change in tau PET 
signal is an outcome measure.

in Older Adults with Normal Cognition or Mild Cognitive Impairment.

BACKGROUND: Declining ability to independently perform instrumental activities 
of daily living (IADL) is a hallmark of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Financial capacity, an aspect of IADL, includes financial skills such as 
balancing a checkbook and making change and is potentially sensitive to early 
decline in cognitive abilities, raising the question of how financial capacity 
is affected by buildup of cerebral tau and amyloid-hallmarks of AD pathology.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the relationship between cerebral tau, 
amyloid, and their interaction with change in financial capacity over time.
DESIGN: Participants were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) to have at least one yearly follow-up Financial Capacity 
Instrument-Short Form (FCI-SF) exam and a flortaucipir (tau) PET scan within 6 
months of baseline (and in a subset, a florbetapir (amyloid) PET scan within a 
year of baseline).
SETTING: Multi-center international cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sample size was 507-322 cognitively normal (CN) and 185 with 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sixty-two percent (N=316) had amyloid 
data.
MEASUREMENTS: Linear mixed-effects models predicted FCI-SF total score from 
baseline tau, age, gender, premorbid intelligence, executive function, memory, 
and the interaction of each with time. Regions of interest included inferior 
temporal, entorhinal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate, supramarginal, and 
dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF). Additional models examined amyloid and its 
interaction with tau. Results were adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Among the whole sample and in CN participants alone, higher baseline 
tau in all regions, most prominently in the inferior temporal, entorhinal 
cortex, and supramarginal regions, was significantly associated with worse 
performance on the FCI-SF over time. Among MCI participants alone, this 
relationship was significant in the entorhinal cortex (unstandardized b = 0.27, 
t = 3.71, adjusted p = 0.001), inferior temporal (b = 0.27, t = 3.96, p < 
0.001), precuneus (b = 0.27, t = 3.04, p = 0.01), and supramarginal (b = 0.27, t 
= 2.74, p = 0.02) regions. Amyloid alone was significantly associated with worse 
FCI-SF performance in only the whole sample (b = 0.15, t = 2.37, p = 0.04), and 
a three-way interaction between tau, amyloid, and time was only present for 
entorhinal cortex tau in CN individuals (b = -1.61, t = -2.61, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Early tau accumulation is linked to worsening financial capacity 
over time in CN older adults and MCI. Declining financial capacity may signal 
pathological buildup and serve as an early warning sign for AD, and future 
research should continue to investigate the longitudinal relationship between 
tau, financial capacity, and other IADL.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using cross-sectional PET to identify 
cognitive decliners among β-amyloid (Aβ)-negative cognitively normal (CN) 
elderly adults.
METHODS: We determined the highest Aβ-affected region by ranking baseline and 
accumulation rates of florbetapir-PET regions in 355 CN elderly adults using 
18F-florbetapir-PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
The banks of the superior temporal sulcus (BANKSSTS) were found as the highest 
Aβ-affected region, and Aβ positivity in this region was defined as above the 
lowest boundary of BANKSSTS standardized uptake value ratio of Aβ+ (ADNI-defined 
COMPOSITE region) CN individuals. The entire CN cohort was divided as follows: 
stage 0, BANKSSTS-COMPOSITE-; stage 1, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE-; and stage 2, 
BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE+. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models investigated subsequent 
longitudinal cognitive change, and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET was measured 4.8 ± 
1.6 years later to track tau deposition.
RESULTS: LME analysis revealed that individuals in stage 1 (n = 64) and stage 2 
(n = 99) showed 2.5 (p < 0.05) and 4.8 (p < 0.001) times faster memory decline, 
respectively, than those in stage 0 (n = 191) over >4 years of mean follow-up. 
Compared to stage 0, both stage 1 (p < 0.05) and stage 2 (p < 0.001) predicted 
higher FTP in entorhinal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Nominally Aβ- CN individuals with high Aβ in BANKSSTS are at 
increased risk of cognitive decline, probably showing an earlier stage of Aβ 
deposition. Our findings may help elucidate the association between brain Aβ 
accumulation and cognition in Aβ- CN cohorts.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in 
elderly CN individuals those with high PET-identified superior temporal sulcus 
Aβ burden have an increased risk of cognitive decline.

and Normal Aging.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the effect of hippocampal subfield 
atrophy on the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing baseline 
magnetic resonance images (MRI) and images collected over a one-year follow-up 
period. Previous studies have suggested that morphological changes to the 
hippocampus are involved in both normal ageing and the development of AD. The 
volume of the hippocampus is an authentic imaging biomarker for AD. However, the 
diverse relationship of anatomical and complex functional connectivity between 
different subfields implies that neurodegenerative disease could lead to 
differences between the atrophy rates of subfields. Therefore, morphometric 
measurements at subfield-level could provide stronger biomarkers.
METHODS: Hippocampal subfield atrophies are measured using MRI scans, taken at 
multiple time points, and shape-based normalization to a Montreal neurological 
institute (MNI) ICBM 152 nonlinear atlas. Ninety subjects were selected from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and divided equally into 
Healthy Controls (HC), AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups. These 
subjects underwent serial MRI studies at three time-points: baseline, 6 months 
and 12 months.
RESULTS: We analyzed the subfield-level hippocampal morphometric effects of 
normal ageing and AD based on radial distance mapping and volume measurements. 
We identified a general trend and observed the largest hippocampal subfield 
atrophies in the AD group. Atrophy of the bilateral CA1, CA2- CA4 and subiculum 
subfields was higher in the case of AD than in MCI and HC. We observed the 
highest rate of reduction in the total volume of the hippocampus, especially in 
the CA1 and subiculum regions, in the case of MCI.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that hippocampal subfield atrophy varies among the 
three study groups.

APOE is one of the strongest genetic factors associated with information 
processing speed (IPS). Herein, we explored the neural substrates underlying 
APOE-related IPS alteration by measuring lobar distribution of white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH), cortical grey matter volume (GMV) and thickness. Using 
the ADNI database, we evaluated 178 cognitively normal elderly individuals 
including 34 APOE ε2 carriers, 54 APOE ε4 carriers and 90 ε3 homozygotes. IPS 
was determined using Trail Making Tests (TMT). We quantified lobar distribution 
of WMH, cortical GM lobar volume, cortical thickness among three groups. 
Finally, we used Pearson's correlation and general linear models to examine 
structural MRI markers in relation to IPS. There were significant differences of 
IPS among groups, with ε4 carriers displaying the worst performance. Across 
groups, significant differences in frontal and parietal WMH load were observed 
(the highest in ε4 carriers); however, no significant differences in cortical 
GMV and thickness were found. Pearson's correlation analysis showed parietal WMH 
volume was significantly related with IPS, especially in ε4 carriers. 
Subsequently a general linear model demonstrated that parietal WMH volume, age 
and the interaction between parietal WMH volume and age, was significantly 
associated with IPS, even after adjusting total intracranial volume (TIV), 
gender and vascular risk factors. Disruption of WM structure, rather than 
atrophy of GM, plays a more critical role in APOE ε4 allele-specific IPS. 
Moreover, specific WMH loci are closely associated with IPS; increased parietal 
WMH volume, especially in ε4 carriers, was independently contributed to slower 
IPS.

Most current Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive disorders (MCI) studies 
use single data modality to make predictions such as AD stages. The fusion of 
multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. 
Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and 
clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use 
stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic 
data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also 
develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features 
learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using 
Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that 
deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, 
decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we 
demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality 
models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models 
have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal 
Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with 
the known AD literature.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and validate a radiomics-integrated model 
with whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the progression of 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: 357 patients with MCI were selected from the ADNI database, which is an 
open-source database for AD with multicentre cooperation, of which 154 
progressed to AD during the 48-month follow-up period. Subjects were divided 
into a training and test group. For each patient, the baseline T1WI MR images 
were automatically segmented into white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), and radiomics features were extracted from each tissue. Based on 
the data from the training group, a radiomics signature was built using logistic 
regression after dimensionality reduction. The radiomics signatures, in 
combination with the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) and baseline neuropsychological 
scales, were used to build an integrated model using machine learning. The 
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and data of the test group were 
used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the model, 
respectively. In addition, the clinical prognostic efficacy of the model was 
evaluated based on the time of progression from MCI to AD.
RESULTS: Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the APOE4, clinical 
dementia rating, AD assessment scale, and radiomics signature were independent 
predictors of MCI progression to AD. The integrated model was constructed based 
on independent predictors using machine learning. The ROC curve showed that the 
accuracy of the model in the training and the test sets was 0.814 and 0.807, 
with a specificity of 0.671 and 0.738, and a sensitivity of 0.822 and 0.745, 
respectively. In addition, the model had the most significant diagnostic 
efficacy in predicting MCI progression to AD within 12 months, with an AUC of 
0.814, sensitivity of 0.726, and specificity of 0.798.
CONCLUSION: The integrated model based on whole-brain radiomics can accurately 
identify and predict the high-risk population of MCI patients who may progress 
to AD. Radiomics biomarkers are practical in the precursory stage of such 
disease.

State-of-the-art rare variant association testing methods aggregate the 
contribution of rare variants in biologically relevant genomic regions to boost 
statistical power. However, testing single genes separately does not consider 
the complex interaction landscape of genes, nor the downstream effects of 
non-synonymous variants on protein structure and function. Here we present the 
NETwork Propagation-based Assessment of Genetic Events (NETPAGE), an integrative 
approach aimed at investigating the biological pathways through which rare 
variation results in complex disease phenotypes. We applied NETPAGE to sporadic, 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), using whole-genome sequencing from the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, as well as whole-exome sequencing from 
the AD Sequencing Project (ADSP). NETPAGE is based on network propagation, a 
framework that models information flow on a graph and simulates the percolation 
of genetic variation through tissue-specific gene interaction networks. The 
result of network propagation is a set of smoothed gene scores that can be 
tested for association with disease status through sparse regression. The 
application of NETPAGE to AD enabled the identification of a set of connected 
genes whose smoothed variation profile was robustly associated to case-control 
status, based on gene interactions in the hippocampus. Additionally, smoothed 
scores significantly correlated with risk of conversion to AD in Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) subjects. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific 
transcriptional dysregulation of the core genes in two independent RNA-seq 
datasets, as well as significant enrichments in terms of gene sets with known 
connections to AD. We present a framework that enables enhanced genetic 
association testing for a wide range of traits, diseases, and sample sizes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) suggest the 
nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) as the origin of structural degeneration 
followed by the entorhinal cortex (EC). However, the functional properties of 
NbM and EC regarding amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau remain unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed resting-state (rs)fMRI data with CSF assays from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n=71) at baseline and two 
years later.
RESULTS: At baseline, local activity, as quantified by fractional amplitude of 
low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), differentiated between normal and abnormal 
CSF groups in the NbM but not EC. Further, NbM activity linearly decreased as a 
function of CSF ratio, resembling the disease status. Finally, NbM activity 
predicted the annual percentage signal change in EC, but not the reverse, 
independent from CSF ratio.
DISCUSSION: Our findings give novel insights into the pathogenesis of AD by 
showing that local activity in NbM is affected by proteinopathology and predicts 
functional degeneration within the EC.

BACKGROUND: Being clinically diagnosed with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely studied. Yet, the clinical and 
structural neuroimaging characteristics for prodromal AD, which are defined as 
A+T+MCI based on the AT (N) system are still highly desirable. This study 
evaluates the differences of the cognitive assessments and structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) between the early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) 
participants based on the AT (N) system. The potential clinical value of the 
structural MRI as a predictor of cognitive decline during follow-up in prodromal 
AD is further investigated.
METHODS: A total of 406 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were chosen and dichotomized into EMCI 
and LMCI groups according to the Second Edition (Logical Memory II) Wechsler 
Memory Scale. Multiple markers' data was collected, including age, sex, years of 
education, ApoE4 status, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, standardized 
uptake values ratios (SUVR) means of florbetapir-PET-AV45, cognitive measures, 
and structural MRI. We chose 197 A+T+MCI participants (prodromal AD) with 
positive biomarkers of Aβ plaques (labeled "A") and fibrillar tau (labeled "T"). 
We diagnosed Aβ plaques positive by the SUVR means of florbetapir-PET-AV45 
(cut-off >1.1) and fibrillar tau positive by CSF phosphorylated-tau at threonine 
181 (p-tau) (cut-off >23 pg/mL). The differences of cognitive assessments and 
regions of interest (ROIs) defined on the MRI template between EMCI and LMCI 
were compared. Furthermore, the potential clinical utility of the MRI as the 
predictor of cognitive decline in prodromal AD was evaluated by investigating 
the relationship between baseline MRI markers and cognition decline at the 
follow-up period, through a linear regression model.
RESULTS: The LMCI participants had a significantly more amyloid burden and CSF 
levels of total t-tau than the EMCI participants. The LMCI participants scored a 
lower result than the EMCI group in the global cognition scales and subscales 
which included tests for memory, delayed recall memory, executive function, 
language, attention and visuospatial skills. The cognition levels declined 
faster in the LMCI participants during the 12- and 24-month follow-up. There 
were significant differences in ROIs on the structural MRI between the two 
groups, including a bilateral entorhinal, a bilateral hippocampus, a bilateral 
amygdala, a bilateral lateral ventricle and cingulate, a corpus callosum, and a 
left temporal. The thickness average of the left entorhinal, the left middle 
temporal, the left superior temporal, and the right isthmus cingulate was a main 
contributor to the decreased global cognition levels. The thickness average of 
the left superior temporal and bilateral entorhinal played a key role in the 
memory domain decline. The thickness average of the left middle temporal, and 
the right isthmus cingulate was significantly associated with an executive 
function decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the AT (N) system, surely, both the EMCI and LMCI 
diagnoses presented significant differences in multiple cognition domains. 
Signature ROIs from the structural MRI tests had correlated a cognitive decline, 
and could act as one potential predictive marker.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition and MCI 
patients are at increased risk of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to evaluate the associations between polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs) and 1) time to AD progression from MCI, 2) changes in 
longitudinal cognitive impairment, and 3) biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid 
and imaging.
METHODS: We constructed PRS by using 40 independent non-APOE SNPs from 
well-replicated AD GWASs and tested its association with the progression time 
from MCI to AD by using 767 MCI patients from the ADNI study and 1373 patients 
from the NACC study. PRSs calculated with other methods were also computed.
RESULTS: We found that the PRS constructed with SNPs that reached genome-wide 
significance predicted the progression from MCI to AD (beta = 0.182, SE = 0.061, 
p = 0.003) after adjusting for the demographic and clinical variables. This 
association was replicated in the NACC dataset (beta = 0.094, SE = 0.037, 
p = 0.009). Further analyses revealed that PRS was associated with the increased 
ADAS-Cog11/ADAS-Cog13/ADASQ4 scores, tau/ptau levels, and cortical amyloid 
burdens (PiB-PET and AV45-PET), but decreased hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 
volumes (p < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of PRS on the 
increased risk of AD may be mediated by Aβ42 (beta = 0.056, SE = 0.026, 
p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PRS can be useful for the prediction of 
time to AD and other clinical changes after the diagnosis of MCI.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that 
primarily affects older individuals. Due to its high incidence, an accurate and 
efficient stratification system could greatly aid in the clinical diagnosis and 
prognosis of AD patients. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) approaches have 
demonstrated exceptional performance in the automated stratification of AD, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) participants using MRI, 
owing to their high predictive accuracy and reliability. Therefore, we aimed to 
develop an algorithm based on CNN and radiomic features derived from ROIs of 
bilateral hippocampus and amygdala in brain MRI for stratification between AD, 
MCI and CN.
METHODS: In this study, we proposed a CNN and radiomic features-based algorithm 
using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
T1-weighted images were used. We utilized three datasets, including AD (199 
cases, 602 images), MCI (200 cases, 948 images), and CN (200 cases, 853 images), 
to perform binary classification (AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN). 
Finally, we obtained the accuracy (ACC) and the area under the curve of the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of the 
algorithm.
RESULTS: Our proposed algorithm achieved acceptable overall discrimination 
accuracy. In the term of AD vs CN, radiomic-based algorithm alone obtained ACC 
of 82.6 % and AUC of 88.8, CNN-based algorithm obtained ACC of 80 % and AUC of 
87.2 and their fusion showed ACC of 84.4 % and AUC of 90. In the term of MCI vs 
CN, radiomic-based algorithm alone obtained ACC of 71.6 % and AUC of 77.8, 
CNN-based algorithm obtained ACC of 69 % and AUC of 75 and their fusion showed 
ACC of 72.7 % and AUC of 80. In the term of AD vs MCI, radiomic-based algorithm 
alone obtained ACC of 57 % and AUC of 57.5, CNN-based algorithm obtained ACC of 
56.6 % and AUC of 57.7 and their fusion showed ACC of 58 % and AUC of 59.5.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it has been determined that hippocampus and 
amygdala-based stratification using CNN features and radiomic features-based 
algorithm is a promising method for the classification of AD, MCI, and CN 
participants.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study proposed an automated procedures based on 
MRI-derived radiomic features and CNN for classification between AD, MCI and CN.

ADAPTIVE TESTING OF SNP-BRAIN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY ASSOCIATION VIA A MODULAR 
NETWORK ANALYSIS.

Due to its high dimensionality and high noise levels, analysis of a large brain 
functional network may not be powerful and easy to interpret; instead, 
decomposition of a large network into smaller subcomponents called modules may 
be more promising as suggested by some empirical evidence. For example, 
alteration of brain modularity is observed in patients suffering from various 
types of brain malfunctions. Although several methods exist for estimating brain 
functional networks, such as the sample correlation matrix or graphical lasso 
for a sparse precision matrix, it is still difficult to extract modules from 
such network estimates. Motivated by these considerations, we adapt a weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) framework to resting-state fMRI 
(rs-fMRI) data to identify modular structures in brain functional networks. 
Modular structures are identified by using topological overlap matrix (TOM) 
elements in hierarchical clustering. We propose applying a new adaptive test 
built on the proportional odds model (POM) that can be applied to a 
high-dimensional setting, where the number of variables (p) can exceed the 
sample size (n) in addition to the usual p < n setting. We applied our proposed 
methods to the ADNI data to test for associations between a genetic variant and 
either the whole brain functional network or its various subcomponents using 
various connectivity measures. We uncovered several modules based on the control 
cohort, and some of them were marginally associated with the APOE4 variant and 
several other SNPs; however, due to the small sample size of the ADNI data, 
larger studies are needed.

INTRODUCTION: Language impairment is frequently observed in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD): in this study, we investigated the extent and 
distribution of brain atrophy in subjects with conversion from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to AD with and without naming difficulties.
METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA 
compliant. All subjects or their legal representatives gave informed consent for 
participation. Ninety-one subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) with (N = 51) and without (N = 40) naming impairment as per 
the Boston Naming Test (BNT), underwent brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 12 
months before, at AD diagnosis, and 12 months after. Structural MR images were 
processed using voxel-based morphometry. Cross-sectional comparisons and mixed 
ANOVA models for assessing regional gray matter (GM) volume differences were 
performed.
RESULTS: As from 12 months prior to AD diagnosis, patients with naming 
difficulties showed distinct areas of greater GM loss in the left fusiform gyrus 
(Brodmann area 20) than patients without naming difficulties. Differences in the 
GM atrophy extended to the left hemisphere in the subsequent 12 months.
CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence of distinct patterns and dynamics of 
brain atrophy in AD patients with naming difficulties when compared to those 
with intact language, as early as 12 months prior to AD diagnosis and in the 
subsequent 12 months.

BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies have shown lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but longitudinal CBF changes in AD are still 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To reveal the longitudinal CBF changes in normal control (NC) and the 
AD continuum using arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging 
(ASL MRI).
METHODS: CBF was calculated from two longitudinal ASL scans acquired 2.22±1.43 
years apart from 140 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). At the baseline scan, the cohort contained 41 NC, 74 mild 
cognitive impairment patients (MCI), and 25 AD patients. 21 NC converted into 
MCI and 17 MCI converted into AD at the follow-up. Longitudinal CBF changes were 
assessed using paired-t test for non-converters and converters separately at 
each voxel and in the meta-ROI. Age and sex were used as covariates.
RESULTS: CBF reductions were observed in all subjects. Stable NC (n = 20) showed 
CBF reduction in the hippocampus and precuneus. Stable MCI patients (n = 57) 
showed spatially more extended CBF reduction patterns in hippocampus, middle 
temporal lobe, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. NC-MCI 
converters showed CBF reduction in hippocampus and cerebellum and CBF increase 
in caudate. MCI-AD converters showed CBF reduction in hippocampus and prefrontal 
cortex. CBF changes were not related with longitudinal neurocognitive changes.
CONCLUSION: Normal aging and AD continuum showed common longitudinal CBF 
reductions in hippocampus independent of disease and its conversion. Disease 
conversion independent longitudinal CBF reductions escalated in MCI subjects.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An effort to define and validate a Harmonized Protocol 
for standard hippocampal segmentation is being carried out. We wished to 
estimate the effect of magnetic resonance image (MRI) spatial orientation on 
manual hippocampal segmentations to define optimal standard orientation of MRIs 
for hippocampal volumetry.
METHODS: Three expert tracers segmented twice the hippocampi of 10 ADNI subjects 
on MRI slices oriented perpendicular to the anterior-posterior commissure 
(AC-PC) line and the long hippocampal axes plane, following internationally 
harmonized landmarks. We computed intra and interrater reliability figures for 
total volumes and similarity coefficients.
RESULTS: Total volume reliability was similar for both orientations. Similarity 
coefficients were significantly higher for the AC-PC orientation (exact P = 
0.002).
DISCUSSION: These data show that AC-PC orientation is slightly more reliable for 
manual segmentations, possibly due to better visualization of the cerebrospinal 
fluid spaces separating hippocampal head and amygdala. A Delphi panel of experts 
has used these data to decide on the optimal orientation for a Harmonized 
Protocol for hippocampal segmentation.

The assessment of in vivo18F images targeting amyloid deposition is currently 
carried on by visual rating with an optional quantification based on 
standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) measurements. We target the difficulties 
of image reading and possible shortcomings of the SUVr methods by validating a 
new semi-quantitative approach named ELBA. ELBA involves a minimal image 
preprocessing and does not rely on small, specific regions of interest (ROIs). 
It evaluates the whole brain and delivers a geometrical/intensity score to be 
used for ranking and dichotomic assessment. The method was applied to adniimages 
18F-florbetapir images from the ADNI database. Five expert readers provided 
visual assessment in blind and open sessions. The longitudinal trend and the 
comparison to SUVr measurements were also evaluated. ELBA performed with area 
under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.997 versus the visual assessment. The score was 
significantly correlated to the SUVr values (r = 0.86, p < 10-4). The 
longitudinal analysis estimated a test/retest error of ≃2.3%. Cohort and 
longitudinal analysis suggests that the ELBA method accurately ranks the brain 
amyloid burden. The expert readers confirmed its relevance in aiding the visual 
assessment in a significant number (85) of difficult cases. Despite the good 
performance, poor and uneven image quality constitutes the major limitation.

We introduce an optimised pipeline for multi-atlas brain MRI segmentation. Both 
accuracy and speed of segmentation are considered. We study different similarity 
measures used in non-rigid registration. We show that intensity differences for 
intensity normalised images can be used instead of standard normalised mutual 
information in registration without compromising the accuracy but leading to 
threefold decrease in the computation time. We study and validate also different 
methods for atlas selection. Finally, we propose two new approaches for 
combining multi-atlas segmentation and intensity modelling based on segmentation 
using expectation maximisation (EM) and optimisation via graph cuts. The 
segmentation pipeline is evaluated with two data cohorts: IBSR data (N=18, six 
subcortial structures: thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, 
amygdala) and ADNI data (N=60, hippocampus). The average similarity index 
between automatically and manually generated volumes was 0.849 (IBSR, six 
subcortical structures) and 0.880 (ADNI, hippocampus). The correlation 
coefficient for hippocampal volumes was 0.95 with the ADNI data. The computation 
time using a standard multicore PC computer was about 3-4 min. Our results 
compare favourably with other recently published results.

BACKGROUND: One significant barrier to incorporate Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
imaging biomarkers into diagnostic criteria is the lack of standardized methods 
for biomarker quantification. The European Alzheimer's Disease 
Consortium-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (EADC-ADNI) Harmonization 
Protocol project provides the most authoritative guideline for hippocampal 
definition and has produced a manually segmented reference dataset for 
validation of automated methods.
PURPOSE: To validate automated hippocampal volumetry using AccuBrain™, against 
the EADC-ADNI dataset, and assess its diagnostic performance for differentiating 
AD and normal aging in an independent cohort.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The EADC-ADNI reference dataset comprise of manually 
segmented hippocampal labels from 135 volumetric T1-weighted scans from various 
scanners. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC), and Pearson's r were obtained for AccuBrain™ and FreeSurfer. The magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of a separate cohort of 299 individuals (150 normal 
controls, 149 with AD) were obtained from the ADNI database and processed with 
AccuBrain™ to assess its diagnostic accuracy. Area under the curve (AUC) for 
total hippocampal volumes (HV) and hippocampal fraction (HF) were determined.
RESULTS: Compared with EADC-ADNI dataset ground truths, AccuBrain™ had a mean 
DSC of 0.89/0.89/0.89, ICC of 0.94/0.96/0.95, and r of 0.95/0.96/0.95 for 
right/left/total HV. AccuBrain™ HV and HF had AUC of 0.76 and 0.80, 
respectively. Thresholds of ≤ 5.71 mL and ≤ 0.38% afforded 80% sensitivity for 
AD detection.
CONCLUSION: AccuBrain™ provides accurate automated hippocampus segmentation in 
accordance with the EADC-ADNI standard, with great potential value in assisting 
clinical diagnosis of AD.

Volume losses in the medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulated, and 
orbitofrontal region have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Smaller 
reductions in similar regions have also been reported in amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI), a canonical precursor to AD. We previously demonstrated that 
volume loss in bilateral anteromedial temporal lobe is present at baseline in 
longitudinally followed normal subjects who later developed MCI or AD. In this 
study we compared grey matter volumes within this predefined anteromedial 
temporal region (AMTR) at baseline between: 1) normal subjects enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who subsequently developed 
cognitive complaints as reflected in a CDR memory box score of 0.5; and 2) 
normal subjects who remained normal over a median of 48 months of follow-up (CDR 
sum of boxes 0). We found significantly decreased volume within AMTR in the ADNI 
memory complainers. To relate AMTR results to those from conventional anatomy, 
we demonstrate that volumes extracted with the ICBM amygdala region had the best 
correspondence with AMTR volumes. In contrast, regions that have demonstrated 
volume loss in frank MCI and AD in ADNI, e.g., the posterior cingulate, did not 
show volume loss. These findings provide independent confirmation that volume 
changes preceding MCI occur in AMTR, a region of overlap between amygdala and 
anterior hippocampus.

Models.

Quantification of anatomical shape changes currently relies on scalar global 
indexes which are largely insensitive to regional or asymmetric modifications. 
Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step 
for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches 
have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they 
lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this 
work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In 
particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of 
anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At 
the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is 
simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling 
the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical 
variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in the 
segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making the 
classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the 
categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen 
segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external 
validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with 
Alzheimer's disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the 
visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical 
features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The 
proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating 
high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies 
of volumetric imaging.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex pathophysiological disease. Allowing for 
heterogeneity, not only in disease manifestations but also in different 
progression patterns, is critical for developing effective disease models that 
can be used in clinical and research settings. We introduce a machine learning 
model for identifying underlying patterns in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trajectory 
using longitudinal multi-modal data from the ADNI cohort and the AIBL cohort. 
Ten biologically and clinically meaningful disease-related states were 
identified from data, which constitute three non-overlapping stages (i.e., 
neocortical atrophy [NCA], medial temporal atrophy [MTA], and whole brain 
atrophy [WBA]) and two distinct disease progression patterns (i.e., NCA  →  WBA 
and MTA  →  WBA). The index of disease-related states provided a remarkable 
performance in predicting the time to conversion to AD dementia (C-Index: 
0.923 ± 0.007). Our model shows potential for promoting the understanding of 
heterogeneous disease progression and early predicting the conversion time to AD 
dementia.

Objective: To investigate whether APOE ε4 affects the association of verbal 
memory with neurodegeneration presented by the hippocampal volume/intracranial 
volume ratio (HpVR). Methods: The study sample included 371 individuals with 
normal cognition (NC), 725 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(aMCI), and 251 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who underwent the rey auditory verbal 
learning test (RAVLT). Multiple linear regression models were conducted to 
assess the effect of the APOE ε4∗HpVR interaction on RAVLT in all subjects and 
in each diagnostic group adjusting for age, gender and educational attainment, 
and global cognition. Results: In all subjects, there was no significant APOE ε4 
× HpVR interaction for immediate recall or delayed recall (p > 0.05). However, 
in aMCI subjects, there was a significant APOE ε4 × HpVR interaction for delayed 
recall (p = 0.008), but not immediate recall (p = 0.15). More specifically, the 
detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on delayed recall altered by HpVR such that this 
effect was most evident among subjects with small to moderate HpVR, but this 
disadvantage was absent or even reversed among subjects with larger HpVR. No 
significant interaction was observed in the NC or AD group. Conclusion: These 
findings highlight a potential role of APOE ε4 status in affecting the 
association of hippocampus size with delayed recall memory in the early stage of 
AD.

Adults Without Dementia.

OBJECTIVE: Mean Diffusivity (MD) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
can be used to detect microstructural alterations of the brain's gray matter 
(GM). A previous study found that higher education, which is a proxy for 
cognitive reserve (CR), was related to decreased hippocampal MD in middle-aged 
healthy adults, indicating decreased microstructural damage in more educated 
participants. Based on this study, we aimed at determining the role of 
hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people 
without dementia.
METHOD: We used a sample of 52 cognitively normal people and 38 participants 
with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) from the ADNI database. MCI and 
cognitively normal participants were analyzed separately. Using linear models, 
we regressed hippocampal GM MD on CR (quantified by a composite score), amyloid 
status and the interaction of both, adjusting for age, gender and memory score.
RESULTS: CR was not associated with hippocampal GM MD and hippocampal GM volume. 
Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found.
CONCLUSION: Our results do not confirm an association of CR and hippocampal GM 
MD in older adults. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an 
association between CR and microstructural, nor macrostructural alterations of 
the hippocampus in older adults. More research is needed to determine the 
influence of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity in relation to age and 
AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: A subset of individuals present at autopsy with the pathologic 
features of Alzheimer's disease having never manifest the clinical symptoms. We 
sought to identify genetic factors that modify the relationship between 
phosphorylated tau (PTau) and dilation of the lateral inferior ventricles.
METHODS: We used data from 700 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A genome-wide association study approach was 
used to identify PTau × single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions. 
Variance explained by these interactions was quantified using hierarchical 
linear regression.
RESULTS: Five SNP × PTau interactions passed a Bonferroni correction, one of 
which (rs4728029, POT1, 2.6% of variance) was consistent across ADNI-1 and 
ADNI-2/GO subjects. This interaction also showed a trend-level association with 
memory performance and levels of interleukin-6 receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rs4728029 modifies the relationship 
between PTau and both ventricular dilation and cognition, perhaps through an 
altered neuroinflammatory response.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether the discrepancy between 
participant and informant estimation of memory decline can predict MCI 
prognosis.
METHODS: Analyses involved data from individuals with MCI enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who filled the Everyday 
Cognition questionnaire. Participants who underestimated (N = 112) and 
overestimated (N = 157) their memory decline were compared on memory tasks, 
brain volume, and cerebrospinal markers, at study entry and after 24 months.
RESULTS: Individuals who underestimated their memory decline performed more 
poorly on memory tests, had smaller hippocampus volume, and greater Alzheimer's 
disease pathology than did individuals who overestimated their cognitive 
decline. Longitudinal comparisons demonstrated that individuals who 
underestimated their decline deteriorated more significantly in memory and in 
brain measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Underestimation of memory decline should raise clinicians' 
suspicion of the existence of AD pathology in individuals with MCI.

Increasing evidence has shown a higher sensitivity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression by local hippocampal atrophy rather than the whole volume. However, 
existing morphological methods based on subfield-volume or surface in imaging 
studies are not capable to describe the comprehensive process of hippocampal 
atrophy as sensitive as histological findings. To map histological distinctive 
measurements onto medical magnetic resonance (MR) images, we propose a 
multiscale skeletal representation (m-s-rep) to quantify focal hippocampal 
atrophy during AD progression in longitudinal cohorts from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The m-s-rep captures 
large-to-small-scale hippocampal morphology by spoke interpolation over label 
projection on skeletal models. To enhance morphological correspondence within 
subjects, we align the longitudinal m-s-reps by surface-based transformations 
from baseline to subsequent timepoints. Cross-sectional and longitudinal 
measurements derived from m-s-rep are statistically analyzed to comprehensively 
evaluate the bilateral hippocampal atrophy. Our findings reveal that during the 
early AD progression, atrophy primarily affects the lateral-medial extent of the 
hippocampus, with a difference of 1.8 mm in lateral-medial width in 2 years 
preceding conversion (p < .001), and the medial head exhibits a maximum 
difference of 3.05%/year in local atrophy rate (p = .011) compared to controls. 
Moreover, progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) exhibits more severe and 
widespread atrophy in the head and body compared to stable mild cognitive 
impairment (sMCI), with a maximum difference of 1.21 mm in thickness in the 
medial head 1 year preceding conversion (p = .012). In summary, our proposed 
method can quantitatively measure the hippocampal morphological changes on 3T MR 
images, potentially assisting the pre-diagnosis and prognosis of AD.

An unsupervised region of interest extraction model for tau PET images and its 
application in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Shi R, Wang L, Jiang J.

BACKGROUND: Recently, tau positron-emission tomography (PET) images have been 
widely used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing 
semi-quantitative uptake value ratios (SUVR) calculation is usually based on 
group analysis or specific brain regions from existing templates, which cannot 
detect individual heterogeneity. In this study, we proposed a novel deep 
learning model; called generative adversarial networks constrained multiple loss 
autoencoder for tau (GANCMLAE4TAU), to extract individual regions of interest 
(ROIs) of tau deposition.
METHODS: The basic framework of the proposed model is composed of two encoders, 
one decoder, and one discriminator. Tau PET images of 327 cognitive normal (CN) 
subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to 
train the model and 29 CNs from Huashan Hospital were used as an external 
validation group. The other 57 AD patients and 83 CNs subjects from ADNI were 
used in the classification task. The Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal 
to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were applied to validate the 
robustness of our model. In addition, we conducted a receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis for the SUVR of individual ROIs from the 
GANCMLAE4TAU model and compared it with SUVR of the whole brain and ROIs from 
the templates.
RESULTS: Our model achieved good SSIM (0.963±0.006), PSNR (35.960±3.458) and MSE 
(0.0004±0.0003). In ROC analysis, our model had the highest area under curve 
(AUC) (0.869, 0.809-0.929) in discriminating AD from CN subjects.
CONCLUSION: GANCMLAE4TAU could detect individual ROIs for tau PET images and had 
the potential to be developed as a novel diagnostic tool in the future. Clinical 
Relevance- This method can find individual ROIs of tau depositions, so as to 
achieve more accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Discriminative Feature Network Based on a Hierarchical Attention Mechanism for 
Semantic Hippocampus Segmentation.

Shi J, Zhang R, Guo L, Gao L, Ma H, Wang J.

The morphological analysis of hippocampus is vital to various neurological 
studies including brain disorders and brain anatomy. To assist doctors in 
analyzing the shape and volume of the hippocampus, an accurate and automatic 
hippocampus segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice. 
Given that fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have made significant 
contributions in biomedical image segmentation applications, we propose a 
notably discriminative feature network based on a hierarchical attention 
mechanism in hippocampal segmentation. First, considering the problem that the 
hippocampus is a rather small part in MR images, we design a context-aware 
high-level feature extraction module (CHFEM) to extract high-level features of 
scale invariance in the encoder stage. Further, we introduce a hierarchical 
attention mechanism into our segmentation framework. The mechanism is divided 
into three parts: a low-level feature spatial attention module (LFSAM) is 
developed to learn the spatial relationship between different pixels on each 
channel in the low-level stage of the encoder, a high-level feature channel 
attention module (HFCAM) is to model the semantic information relationship on 
different channel images in the high-level stage of the encoder, and a 
cross-connected attention module (CCAM) is designed in the decoder part to 
further suppress the noisy boundaries of hippocampus and simultaneously utilize 
the attentional low-level features from the encoder to better guide the 
high-level hippocampus edge segmentation in the decoder phase. The proposed 
approach achieves outstanding performance on the ADNI dataset and the Decathlon 
dataset compared with other semantic segmentation models and existing 
hippocampal segmentation approaches. Source code is available at

BACKGROUND: To measure hippocampal volume change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), expert manual delineation is often used because 
of its supposed accuracy. It has been suggested that expert outlining yields 
poorer reproducibility as compared to automated methods, but this has not been 
investigated.
AIM: To determine the reproducibilities of expert manual outlining and two 
common automated methods for measuring hippocampal atrophy rates in healthy 
aging, MCI and AD.
METHODS: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 80 
subjects were selected: 20 patients with AD, 40 patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Left and right hippocampal 
volume change between baseline and month-12 visit was assessed by using expert 
manual delineation, and by the automated software packages FreeSurfer 
(longitudinal processing stream) and FIRST. To assess reproducibility of the 
measured hippocampal volume change, both back-to-back (BTB) MPRAGE scans 
available for each visit were analyzed. Hippocampal volume change was expressed 
in μL, and as a percentage of baseline volume. Reproducibility of the 1-year 
hippocampal volume change was estimated from the BTB measurements by using 
linear mixed model to calculate the limits of agreement (LoA) of each method, 
reflecting its measurement uncertainty. Using the delta method, approximate 
p-values were calculated for the pairwise comparisons between methods. 
Statistical analyses were performed both with inclusion and exclusion of visibly 
incorrect segmentations.
RESULTS: Visibly incorrect automated segmentation in either one or both scans of 
a longitudinal scan pair occurred in 7.5% of the hippocampi for FreeSurfer and 
in 6.9% of the hippocampi for FIRST. After excluding these failed cases, 
reproducibility analysis for 1-year percentage volume change yielded LoA of 
±7.2% for FreeSurfer, ±9.7% for expert manual delineation, and ±10.0% for FIRST. 
Methods ranked the same for reproducibility of 1-year μL volume change, with LoA 
of ±218 μL for FreeSurfer, ±319 μL for expert manual delineation, and ±333 μL 
for FIRST. Approximate p-values indicated that reproducibility was better for 
FreeSurfer than for manual or FIRST, and that manual and FIRST did not differ. 
Inclusion of failed automated segmentations led to worsening of reproducibility 
of both automated methods for 1-year raw and percentage volume change.
CONCLUSION: Quantitative reproducibility values of 1-year microliter and 
percentage hippocampal volume change were roughly similar between expert manual 
outlining, FIRST and FreeSurfer, but FreeSurfer reproducibility was 
statistically significantly superior to both manual outlining and FIRST after 
exclusion of failed segmentations.

BACKGROUND: Rapid advancement of next generation sequencing technologies such as 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the search for genetic factors 
that influence disease risk in the field of human genetics. To identify rare 
variants associated with human diseases or traits, an efficient genome-wide 
binning approach is needed. In this study we developed a novel biological 
knowledge-based binning approach for rare-variant association analysis and then 
applied the approach to structural neuroimaging endophenotypes related to 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
METHODS: For rare-variant analysis, we used the knowledge-driven binning 
approach implemented in Bin-KAT, an automated tool, that provides 1) 
binning/collapsing methods for multi-level variant aggregation with a flexible, 
biologically informed binning strategy and 2) an option of performing unified 
collapsing and statistical rare variant analyses in one tool. A total of 750 
non-Hispanic Caucasian participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort who had both WGS data and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans were used in this study. Mean bilateral cortical thickness of the 
entorhinal cortex extracted from MRI scans was used as an AD-related 
neuroimaging endophenotype. SKAT was used for a genome-wide gene- and 
region-based association analysis of rare variants (MAF (minor allele 
frequency) < 0.05) and potential confounding factors (age, gender, years of 
education, intracranial volume (ICV) and MRI field strength) for entorhinal 
cortex thickness were used as covariates. Significant associations were 
determined using FDR adjustment for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Our knowledge-driven binning approach identified 16 functional exonic 
rare variants in FANCC significantly associated with entorhinal cortex thickness 
(FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05). In addition, the approach identified 7 
evolutionary conserved regions, which were mapped to FAF1, RFX7, LYPLAL1 and 
GOLGA3, significantly associated with entorhinal cortex thickness (FDR-corrected 
p-value < 0.05). In further analysis, the functional exonic rare variants in 
FANCC were also significantly associated with hippocampal volume and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42 (p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel binning approach identified rare variants in FANCC as 
well as 7 evolutionary conserved regions significantly associated with a 
LOAD-related neuroimaging endophenotype. FANCC (fanconi anemia complementation 
group C) has been shown to modulate TLR and p38 MAPK-dependent expression of 
IL-1β in macrophages. Our results warrant further investigation in a larger 
independent cohort and demonstrate that the biological knowledge-driven binning 
approach is a powerful strategy to identify rare variants associated with AD and 
other complex disease.

Identifying Candidate Genetic Associations with MRI-Derived AD-Related ROI via 
Tree-Guided Sparse Learning.

Hao X, Yao X, Risacher SL, Saykin AJ, Yu J, Wang H, Tan L, Shen L, Zhang D.

Imaging genetics has attracted significant interests in recent studies. 
Traditional work has focused on mass-univariate statistical approaches that 
identify important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
quantitative traits (QTs) of brain structure or function. More recently, to 
address the problem of multiple comparison and weak detection, multivariate 
analysis methods such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(Lasso) are often used to select the most relevant SNPs associated with QTs. 
However, one problem of Lasso, as well as many other feature selection methods 
for imaging genetics, is that some useful prior information, e.g., the 
hierarchical structure among SNPs, are rarely used for designing a more powerful 
model. In this paper, we propose to identify the associations between candidate 
genetic features (i.e., SNPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived 
measures using a tree-guided sparse learning (TGSL) method. The advantage of our 
method is that it explicitly models the complex hierarchical structure among the 
SNPs in the objective function for feature selection. Specifically, motivated by 
the biological knowledge, the hierarchical structures involving gene groups and 
linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks as well as individual SNPs are imposed as a 
tree-guided regularization term in our TGSL model. Experimental studies on 
simulation data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data 
show that our method not only achieves better predictions than competing methods 
on the MRI-derived measures of AD-related region of interests (ROIs) (i.e., 
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus), but also identifies sparse 
SNP patterns at the block level to better guide the biological interpretation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative 
disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. 
Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are 
available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the 
prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of 
the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and 
volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer 
from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is 
independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal 
performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework 
based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal 
segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a 
multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal 
segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely 
Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D 
patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the 
classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and 
DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated 
on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 
119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity 
coefficient of 87.0% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed 
method achieves an accuracy of 88.9% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 
92.5% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2% and an AUC of 
77.5% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates 
that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and 
several other competing methods.

The hippocampus has been widely studied using neuroimaging, as it plays an 
important role in memory and learning. However, hippocampal subfield information 
is difficult to capture by standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. 
To facilitate morphometric study of hippocampal subfields, ADNI introduced a 
high resolution (0.4 mm in plane) T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence that 
requires 8 min. With acceleration, the protocol can be acquired in 4 min. We 
performed a comparative study of hippocampal subfield volumes using standard and 
accelerated protocols on a Siemens Prisma 3T MRI in an independent sample of 
older adults that included 10 cognitively normal controls, 9 individuals with 
subjective cognitive decline, 10 with mild cognitive impairment, and 6 with a 
clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Automatic Segmentation of 
Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software was used to segment 9 primary labeled 
regions including hippocampal subfields and neighboring cortical regions. 
Intraclass correlation coefficients were computed for reliability tests between 
4 and 8 min scans within and across the four groups. Pairwise group analyses 
were performed, covaried for age, sex and total intracranial volume, to 
determine whether the patterns of group differences were similar using 4 vs. 
8 min scans. The 4 and 8 min protocols, analyzed by ASHS segmentation, yielded 
similar volumetric estimates for hippocampal subfields as well as comparable 
patterns of differences between study groups. The accelerated protocol can 
provide reliable imaging data for investigation of hippocampal subfields in 
AD-related MRI studies and the decreased scan time may result in less 
vulnerability to motion.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal volumetry on magnetic resonance imaging is recognized as 
an Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker, and manual segmentation is the gold 
standard for measurement. However, a standard procedure is lacking. We 
operationalize and quantitate landmark differences to help a Delphi panel 
converge on a set of landmarks.
METHODS: One hundred percent of anatomic landmark variability across 12 
different protocols for manual segmentation was reduced into four segmentation 
units (the minimum hippocampus, the alveus/fimbria, the tail, and the 
subiculum), which were segmented on magnetic resonance images by expert raters 
to estimate reliability and AD-related atrophy.
RESULTS: Intra- and interrater reliability were more than 0.96 and 0.92, 
respectively, except for the alveus/fimbria, which were 0.86 and 0.77, 
respectively. Of all AD-related atrophy, the minimum hippocampus contributed to 
67%; tail, 24%; alveus/fimbria, 4%; and the subiculum, 5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic landmark variability in available protocols can be reduced 
to four discrete and measurable segmentation units. Their quantitative 
assessment will help a Delphi panel to define a set of landmarks for a 
harmonized protocol.

Background: Predicting the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is important for treatment selection and patient counseling. 
Structural MRI markers such as hippocampus or basal forebrain volumes might 
represent useful instruments for the prediction of cognitive decline. The 
primary objective was to determine the predictive value of hippocampus and basal 
forebrain volumes for global and domain specific cognitive decline in AD 
dementia during cholinergic treatment. Methods: We used MRI and cognitive data 
from 124 patients with the clinical diagnosis of AD dementia, derived from the 
ADNI-1 cohort, who were on standard of care cholinesterase inhibitor treatment 
during a follow-up period between 0.4 and 3.1 years. We used linear mixed 
effects models with cognitive function as outcome to assess the main effects as 
well as two-way interactions between baseline volumes and time controlling for 
age, sex, and total intracranial volume. This model accounts for individual 
variation in follow-up times. Results: Basal forebrain volume, but not 
hippocampus volume, was a significant predictor of rates of global cognitive 
decline. Larger volumes were associated with smaller rates of cognitive decline. 
Left hippocampus volume had a modest association with rates of episodic memory 
decline. Baseline performance in global cognition and memory was significantly 
associated with hippocampus and basal forebrain volumes; in addition, basal 
forebrain volume was associated with baseline performance in executive function. 
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that in AD dementia patients, basal forebrain 
volume may be a useful marker to predict subsequent cognitive decline during 
cholinergic treatment.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, many convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been 
proposed for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. Due to memory 
constraints, many of the proposed CNNs work at a 2D slice-level or 3D 
patch-level.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we propose a subject-level 3D CNN that can extract the 
neurodegenerative patterns of the whole brain MRI and converted into a 
probabilistic Dementia score.
METHODS: We propose an efficient and lightweight subject-level 3D CNN featuring 
dilated convolutions. We trained our network on the ADNI data on stable Dementia 
of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) from stable normal controls (sNC). To 
comprehensively evaluate the generalizability of our proposed network, we 
performed four independent tests which includes testing on images from other 
ADNI individuals at various stages of the dementia, images acquired from other 
sites (AIBL), images acquired using different protocols (OASIS), and 
longitudinal images acquired over a short period of time (MIRIAD).
RESULTS: We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated balanced accuracy of 88%in 
differentiating sDAT from sNC, and an overall specificity of 79.5%and 
sensitivity 79.7%on the entire set of 7,902 independent test images.
CONCLUSION: Independent testing is essential for estimating the generalization 
ability of the network to unseen data, but is often lacking in studies using CNN 
for DAT classification. This makes it difficult to compare the performances 
achieved using different architectures. Our comprehensive evaluation 
highlighting the competitive performance of our network and potential promise 
for generalization.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central 
nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and 
may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have 
long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, 
quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to 
improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This 
work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from 
T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based 
disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease 
Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for 
early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent 
large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank.
FINDINGS: 1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control 
images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 
participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI 
cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification 
performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD 
detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted 
structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus 
and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The 
normalized ML model's probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was 
evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There 
are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during 
pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the 
integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 
0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score 
is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% 
CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows 
association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our 
integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score 
quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we 
validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging 
scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. 
In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical 
assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological 
markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated 
with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we 
can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in 
the future.
INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated 
using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease 
probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early 
detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression. To 
facilitate community engagement and external tests of model utility, an 
interactive app to explore summary level data from this study and dive into 
external data can be found here https://ndds-brainimaging-ml.streamlit.app. As 
far as we know, this is the first publicly available cloud-based MRI prediction 
application.

Body mass index (BMI) has a complex relationship with Alzheimer's disease (AD); 
in midlife, high BMI is associated with increased risk for AD, whereas the 
relationship in late-life is still unclear. To clarify the relationship between 
late-life BMI and risk for AD, this study examined the extent to which genetic 
predisposition for AD moderates BMI and AD-related biomarker associations. 
Participants included 126 cognitively normal older adults at baseline from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Genetic risk for AD 
was assessed via polygenic hazard score. AD-related biomarkers assessed were 
medial temporal lobe volume and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. 
Hierarchical linear regressions were implemented to examine the effects of BMI 
and polygenic hazard score on AD-related biomarkers. Results showed that BMI 
moderated the relationship between genetic risk for AD and medial temporal lobe 
volume, such that individuals with high BMI and high genetic risk for AD showed 
lower volume in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In sex-stratified 
analyses, these results remained significant only in females. Finally, BMI and 
genetic risk for AD were independently associated with CSF biomarkers of AD. 
These results provide evidence that high BMI is associated with lower volume in 
AD-vulnerable brain regions in individuals at genetic risk for AD, particularly 
females. The genetic pathways of AD may be exacerbated by high BMI. 
Environmental and genetic risk factors rarely occur in isolation, which 
underscores the importance of looking at their synergistic effects, as they 
provide insight into early risk factors for AD that prevention methods could 
target.

This work explores the feasibility of combining anatomical MRI data across two 
public repositories namely, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) and the Progressive Parkinson's Markers Initiative (PPMI). We compared 
cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in cognitively normal older adults 
between datasets with distinct imaging parameters to assess if they would 
provide equivalent information. Three distinct datasets were identified. Major 
differences in data were scanner manufacturer and the use of magnetization 
inversion to enhance tissue contrast. Equivalent datasets, i.e., those providing 
similar volumetric measurements in cognitively normal controls, were identified 
in ADNI and PPMI. These were datasets obtained on the Siemens scanner with TI = 
900 ms. Our secondary goal was to assess the agreement between subcortical 
volumes that are obtained with different software packages. Three subcortical 
measurement applications (FSL, FreeSurfer, and a recent multi-atlas approach) 
were compared. Our results show significant agreement in the measurements of 
caudate, putamen, pallidum, and hippocampus across the packages and poor 
agreement between measurements of accumbens and amygdala. This is likely due to 
their smaller size and lack of gray matter-white matter tissue contrast for 
accurate segmentation. This work provides a segue to combine imaging data from 
ADNI and PPMI to increase statistical power as well as to interrogate common 
mechanisms in disparate pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases. It lays the foundation for comparison of anatomical data acquired with 
disparate imaging parameters and analyzed with disparate software tools. 
Furthermore, our work partly explains the variability in the results of studies 
using different software packages.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ42) 
accompanied by brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Several recent studies have 
shown that Aβ42 accumulation is associated with gray matter (GM) changes prior 
to the development of cognitive impairment, in the so-called preclinical stage 
of the AD (pre-AD). It also has been proved that the GM atrophy profile is not 
linear, both in normal ageing but, especially, on AD. However, several other 
factors may influence this association and may have an impact on the 
generalization of results from different samples. In this work, we estimate 
differences in rates of GM volume change in cognitively healthy elders in 
association with baseline core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and 
assess to what these differences are sample dependent. We report the dependence 
of atrophy rates, measured in a two-year interval, on Aβ42, computed both over 
continuous and categorical values of Aβ42, at voxel-level (p < 0.001; k < 100) 
and corrected for sex, age and education. Analyses were performed jointly and 
separately, on two samples. The first sample was formed of 31 individuals (22 
Ctrl and 9 pre-AD), aged 60-80 and recruited at the Hospital Clinic of 
Barcelona. The second sample was a replica of the first one with subjects 
selected from the ADNI dataset. We also investigated the dependence of the GM 
atrophy rate on the basal levels of continuous p-tau and on the p-tau/Aβ42 
ratio. Correlation analyses on the whole sample showed a dependence of GM 
atrophy rates on Aβ42 in medial and orbital frontal, precuneus, cingulate, 
medial temporal regions and cerebellum. Correlations with p-tau were located in 
the left hippocampus, parahippocampus and striatal nuclei whereas correlation 
with p-tau/Aβ42 was mainly found in ventral and medial temporal areas. Regarding 
analyses performed separately, we found a substantial discrepancy of results 
between samples, illustrating the complexities of comparing two independent 
datasets even when using the same inclusion criteria. Such discrepancies may 
lead to significant differences in the sample size needed to detect a particular 
reduction on cerebral atrophy rates in prevention trials. Higher cognitive 
reserve and more advanced pathological progression in the ADNI sample could 
partially account for the observed discrepancies. Taken together, our findings 
in these two samples highlight the importance of comparing and merging 
independent datasets to draw more robust and generalizable conclusions on the 
structural changes in the preclinical stages of AD.

Assessment of temporal lobe atrophy from magnetic resonance images is a part of 
clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. As 
hippocampus is known to be among the first areas affected by the disease, fast 
and robust definition of hippocampus volume would be of great importance in the 
clinical decision making. We propose a method for computing automatically the 
volume of hippocampus using a modified multi-atlas segmentation framework, 
including an improved initialization of the framework and the correction of 
partial volume effect. The method produced a high similarity index, 0.87, and 
correlation coefficient, 0.94, with semi-automatically generated segmentations. 
When comparing hippocampus volumes extracted from 1.5T and 3T images, the 
absolute value of the difference was low: 3.2% of the volume. The correct 
classification rate for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal cases was 
about 80% while the accuracy 65% was obtained for classifying stable and 
progressive mild cognitive impairment cases. The method was evaluated in three 
cohorts consisting altogether about 1000 cases, the main emphasis being in the 
analysis of the ADNI cohort. The computation time of the method is about 2 
minutes on a standard laptop computer. The results show a clear potential for 
applying the method in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLBs) represent 2 different pathologies, they have clinical 
overlap, and there is a significant degree of co-occurrence of their 
neuropathologic findings. Many studies have examined imaging characteristics in 
clinically diagnosed patients; however, there is a relative lack of longitudinal 
studies that have studied patients with pathologic confirmation. We examined 
whether there were differences in longitudinal patterns of cortical atrophy 
between patients with both AD and DLB (AD/DLB) vs those with AD alone.
METHODS: We collected and analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for patients who underwent autopsy. The 
rates of change in various neuropsychological assessments were not significantly 
different between patients with AD/DLB and AD, and each group had 
neuropsychological outcomes consistent with disease progression. For our 
neuroimaging analysis, we used a linear mixed-effects model to examine whether 
there were longitudinal differences in cortical rates of atrophy between 
patients with AD/DLB and AD.
RESULTS: Autopsies and serial neuroimaging were available on 48 patients (24 AD 
and 24 AD/DLB). Patients with AD alone had significantly higher atrophy rates in 
the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions over time when 
compared with patients with concomitant DLB, after covarying for interval from 
imaging to autopsy, sex, and total estimated intracranial volume. Site ID was 
included as a random effect to account for site differences. For these regions, 
the rate of decline over time in the AD/DLB group was less steep by a difference 
of 0.1887, 0.395, and 0.0989, respectively (p = 0.022, 0.006, and 0.006). The 
lattermost left cuneus volume measurement and Braak Lewy score had a Pearson 
product-moment correlation of 0.37, p = 0.009, while the lattermost left 
parahippocampal volume measurement and Braak neurofibrillary tangle score had a 
Pearson product-moment correlation of -0.327, p = 0.02.
DISCUSSION: Patients with AD had more significant atrophy in the left cuneus, 
lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions when compared with patients with 
AD/DLB. These regions are known to distinguish DLB and AD pathology 
cross-sectionally but here are shown to distinguish longitudinal disease 
progression.

Our goal was to assess the enrichment utility of hippocampal volume (HV) as an 
enrichment biomarker in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) clinical 
trials, and, hence, develop an HV neuroimaging-informed clinical trial 
enrichment tool. Modeling of integrated longitudinal patient-level data came 
from open-access natural history studies in patients diagnosed with aMCI-the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1 and ADNI-2-and indicated 
that a decrease of 1 cm3 with respect to the analysis dataset median baseline 
intracranial volume-adjusted HV (ICV-HV; ~ 5 cm3 ) is associated with > 50% 
increase in disease progression rate as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating 
Scale-Sum of Boxes. Clinical trial simulations showed that the inclusion of aMCI 
subjects with baseline ICV-HV below the 84th or 50th percentile allowed an 
approximate reduction in trial size of at least 26% and 55%, respectively. This 
clinical trial enrichment tool can help design more efficient and informative 
clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition that 
can precede various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Identifying MCI subjects who are at high risk of progressing to AD is of major 
clinical relevance. Enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) on MRI are linked to 
cognitive decline, but their predictive value for MCI to AD progression is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the predictive value of EPVS for MCI to AD 
progression and develop a predictive model combining EPVS grading with clinical 
and laboratory data to estimate conversion risk.
METHODS: We analyzed 358 patients with MCI from the ADNI database, consisting of 
177 MCI-AD converters and 181 non-converters. The data collected included 
demographic information, imaging data (including perivascular spaces grade), 
clinical assessments, and laboratory test results. Variable selection was 
conducted using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
method, followed by logistic regression to develop predictive model.
RESULTS: In the univariate logistic regression analysis, both moderate 
(OR = 5.54, 95% CI [3.04-10.18]) and severe (OR = 25.04, 95% CI [10.07-62.23]) 
enlargements of the centrum semiovale perivascular space (CSO-PVS) were found to 
be strong predictors of disease progression. LASSO analyses yielded 12 
variables, refined to six in the final model: APOE4 genotype, ADAS11 score, 
CSO-PVS grade, and volumes of entorhinal, fusiform, and midtemporal regions, 
with an AUC of 0.956 in the training and 0.912 in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive model, emphasizing EPVS assessment, provides 
clinicians with a practical tool for early detection and management of AD risk 
in MCI patients.

Molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) are difficult to 
investigate, partly because diagnosis lags behind the insidious pathological 
processes. Therefore, identifying AD neuroimaging markers and their genetic 
modifiers may help study early mechanisms of neurodegeneration. We aimed to 
identify brain regions of the highest vulnerability to AD using a data-driven 
search in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 1,100 subjects), and further 
explored genetic variants affecting this critical brain trait using both ADNI 
and the younger UK Biobank cohort (n = 8,428 subjects). Tensor-Based Morphometry 
(TBM) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) identified the limbic system and 
its interconnecting white-matter as the most AD-vulnerable brain feature. 
Whole-genome analysis revealed a common variant in SHARPIN that was associated 
with this imaging feature (rs34173062, p = 2.1 × 10-10 ). This genetic 
association was validated in the UK Biobank, where it was correlated with 
entorhinal cortical thickness bilaterally (p = .002 left and p = 8.6 × 10-4 
right), and with parental history of AD (p = 2.3 × 10-6 ). Our findings suggest 
that neuroanatomical variation in the limbic system and AD risk are associated 
with a novel variant in SHARPIN. The role of this postsynaptic density gene 
product in β1-integrin adhesion is in line with the amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) intracellular signaling pathway and the recent genome-wide evidence.

There is accumulating evidence that neurotrophins, like brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may impact aging and Alzheimer's Disease. However, 
traditional genetic association studies have not found a clear relationship 
between BDNF and AD. Our goal was to test whether BDNF single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) impact Alzheimer's Disease-related brain imaging and 
cognitive markers of disease. We completed an imaging genetics study on 645 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (ND=175, MCI=316, 
AD=154) who had cognitive, brain imaging, and genetics data at baseline and a 
subset of those with brain imaging data at two years. Samples were genotyped 
using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 13 SNPs in BDNF were identified in 
the dataset following quality control measures (rs6265(Val66Met), rs12273363, 
rs11030094, rs925946, rs1050187, rs2203877, rs11030104, rs11030108, rs10835211, 
rs7934165, rs908867, rs1491850, rs1157459). We analyzed a subgroup of 8 SNPs 
that were in low linkage disequilibrium with each other. Automated brain 
morphometric measures were available through ADNI investigators, and we analyzed 
baseline cognitive scores, hippocampal and whole brain volumes, and rates of 
hippocampal and whole brain atrophy and rates of change in the ADAS-Cog over one 
and two years. Three out of eight BDNF SNPs analyzed were significantly 
associated with measures of cognitive decline (rs1157659, rs11030094, 
rs11030108). No SNPs were significantly associated with baseline brain volume 
measures, however six SNPs were significantly associated with hippocampal and/or 
whole brain atrophy over two years (rs908867, rs11030094, rs6265, rs10501087, 
rs1157659, rs1491850). We also found an interaction between the BDNF Val66Met 
SNP and age with whole brain volume. Our imaging-genetics analysis in a large 
dataset suggests that while BDNF genetic variation is not specifically 
associated with a diagnosis of AD, it appears to play a role in AD-related brain 
neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Given the varying vulnerability of the rostral and caudal regions of 
the hippocampus to neuropathology in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, 
accurately assessing structural changes in these subregions is crucial for early 
AD detection. The development of reliable and robust automatic segmentation 
methods for hippocampal subregions (HS) is of utmost importance.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to propose and validate a HS segmentation model that is 
both training-free and highly generalizable. This method should exhibit 
comparable accuracy and efficiency to state-of-the-art techniques. The segmented 
HS can serve as a biomarker for studying the progression of AD.
METHODS: We utilized the functional magnetic resonance imaging of the Brain's 
Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) to segment the entire 
hippocampus. By intersecting the segmentation results with the Brainnetome (BN) 
atlas, we obtained coarse segmentation of the four HS regions. This coarse 
segmentation was then employed as a shape prior term in the lattice Boltzmann 
(LB) model, as well as for initializing contours. Additionally, image gradients 
and local gray levels were integrated into the external force terms of the LB 
model to refine the coarse segmentation results. We assessed the segmentation 
accuracy of the model using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset and evaluated the potential of the segmentation results as AD 
biomarkers on both the ADNI and Xuanwu datasets.
RESULTS: The median Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for the left caudal, 
right caudal, left rostral, and right rostral hippocampus were 0.87, 0.88, 0.88, 
and 0.89, respectively. The proportion of segmentation results with a DSC 
exceeding 0.8 was 77%, 78%, 77%, and 94% for the respective regions. In terms of 
volume, the correlation coefficients between the segmentation results of the 
four HS regions and the gold standard were 0.95, 0.93, 0.96, and 0.96, 
respectively. Regarding asymmetry, the correlation coefficient between the 
segmentation result's right caudal minus left caudal and the corresponding gold 
standard was 0.91, while for right rostral minus left rostral, it was 0.93. Over 
time, we observed a decline in the volumes of the four HS regions and the total 
hippocampal volume of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converters. Analysis of 
inter-group differences revealed that, except for the right rostral region in 
the ADNI dataset, the p-values for the four HS regions in the normal controls 
(NC), MCI, and AD groups from both datasets were all below 0.05. The right 
caudal hippocampal volume demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.47 and 0.43 
with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment 
(MoCA), respectively. Similarly, the left rostral hippocampal volume showed 
correlation coefficients of 0.50 and 0.58 with MMSE and MoCA, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our framework allows for direct application to different brain 
magnetic resonance (MR) datasets without the need for training. It eliminates 
the requirement for complex image preprocessing steps while achieving 
segmentation accuracy comparable to deep learning (DL) methods even with small 
sample sizes. Compared to traditional active contour models (ACM) and 
atlas-based methods, our approach exhibits significant speed advantages. The 
segmented HS regions hold promise as potential biomarkers for studying the 
progression of AD.

INTRODUCTION: The ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) is a large 
longitudinal study of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy elderly controls followed for 
at least 2-3 years. Many participants in the ADNI are being treated with 
medications, and these may have beneficial or deleterious effects.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to characterize baseline medication use in 
the ADNI.
METHODS: Diagnosis, demographics, medication status, psychometric data and MRI 
measures of hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness were obtained for 
818 participants from the ADNI cohort. Total number of medications, Beers list 
(potentially dangerous) medications and AD treatments were also tabulated. ANOVA 
and logistic regression were used to assess associations between baseline 
pharmacotherapy and diagnosis, demographics, and selected clinical and MRI 
variables.
RESULTS: Of the 818 enrolled ADNI participants, 809 were available for analysis 
in the present study, including 184 patients with AD, 399 patients with MCI and 
226 healthy elderly controls. Significant gender differences in recruitment were 
observed in the MCI group. The average number of medications per participant was 
8 (SD 4) and 22% reported treatment with one or more Beers list medications. For 
symptomatic treatment of MCI or AD, donepezil and memantine were the most 
commonly reported drugs. As expected, MCI and AD patients with more severe 
impairment were more likely to be treated. Men received treatment more 
frequently than women. Older subjects and those with less education were less 
likely to receive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: AD and MCI participants from the ADNI cohort were being treated 
with polypharmacy and many were also taking one or more medications with the 
potential for adverse effects. Off-label use of cholinesterase inhibitors and/or 
memantine for MCI was common, with more severely affected patients most likely 
to receive treatment. Differences in the frequency of symptomatic treatment were 
also observed as a function of age, years of education, gender and disease 
severity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered one of the most spouting elderly 
diseases. In 2015, AD is reported the US's sixth cause of death. Substantially, 
non-invasive imaging is widely employed to provide biomarkers supporting AD 
screening, diagnosis, and progression. In this study, Gaussian descriptors-based 
features are proposed to be efficient new biomarkers using Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) T1-weighted images to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Normal controls (NC). Several 
Gaussian map-based features are extracted such as Gaussian shape operator, 
Gaussian curvature, and mean curvature. The aforementioned features are then 
introduced to the Support Vector Machine (SVM). They were, first, calculated 
separately for the Hippocampus and Amygdala. Followed by the fusion of the 
features. Moreover, Fusion of the regions before feature extraction was also 
employed. Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, formed of 
45, 55, and 65 cases for AD, MCI, and NC respectively, is appointed in this 
study. The shape operator feature outperformed the other features, with 74.6%, 
and 98.9% accuracy in the case of normal vs. abnormal, and AD vs. MCI 
classification respectively.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), association of cognition with disease biomarkers is 
important for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and staging. We studied the value of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical thickness (CT), and volume (V) measures (in 
isolation & combination) to predict cognitive ability, as well as cognitive 
status, in a cross-sectional study of data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Cognitive status was measured by Mini Mental State Exam 
(MMSE). Results show that combining biomarkers allows more accurate AD 
diagnosis. Specifically, combining CSF, CT, and V measures seems promising. In 
isolation, CSF levels show significant but weak associations with MMSE. Aβ 1– 42 
is associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment. CT and V measures of hippocampus 
and entorhinal cortex are strongly associated with Alzheimer ‘s Disease 
diagnosis and with ruling out the disease.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε 4 has been identified as the strongest 
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the importance of 
ApoE ε 4 on clinical and biological heterogeneity of AD is still to be 
determined, particularly at the prodromal stage. Here, we evaluate the 
association of ApoE ε 4 with clinical cognition and neuroimaging regions in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) participants based on the AT (N) system, which is 
increasingly essential for developing a precise assessment of AD.
METHODS: We stratified 178 A+T+MCI participants (prodromal AD) into ApoE ε 4 (+) 
and ApoE ε 4 (-) according to ApoE genotype from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We determined Aβ-positivity (A+) by the 
standardized uptake values ratios (SUVR) means of florbetapir-PET-AV45 (the 
cut-off value of 1.1) and fibrillar tau-positivity (T+) by cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) phosphorylated-tau at threonine 181 position (p-Tau) (cut-off value of 23 
pg/mL). We evaluated the effect of ApoE ε 4 status on cognitive conditions and 
brain atrophy from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A 
multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare the differences of 
cognitive scores and brain atrophy from structural MRI regions of interest 
(ROIs) between both groups. Furthermore, we performed a linear regression model 
to assess the correlation between signature ROIs of structural MRI and cognitive 
scores in the prodromal AD participants.
RESULTS: ApoE ε 4 (+) prodromal AD participants had lower levels of CSF Aβ 1-42, 
higher levels of t-Tau, more memory and global cognitive impairment, and faster 
decline of global cognition, compared to ApoE ε 4 (-) prodromal AD. ApoE ε 4 (+) 
prodromal AD participants had a thinner cortical thickness of bilateral 
entorhinal, smaller subcortical volume of the left amygdala, bilateral 
hippocampus, and left ventral diencephalon (DC) relative to ApoE ε 4 (-) 
prodromal AD. Furthermore, the cortical thickness average of bilateral 
entorhinal was highly correlated with memory and global cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: ApoE ε 4 status in prodromal AD participants has an important 
effect on clinical cognitive domains. After ascertaining the ApoE ε 4 status, 
specific MRI regions can be correlated to the cognitive domain and will be 
helpful for precise assessment in prodromal AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain 
disorder. Hippocampus is one of the involved regions and its atrophy is a widely 
used biomarker for AD diagnosis. We have recently developed DenseCNN, a 
lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model, for AD classification based on 
hippocampus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segments. In addition to the visual 
features of the hippocampus segments, the global shape representations of the 
hippocampus are also important for AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose 
DenseCNN2, a deep convolutional network model for AD classification by 
incorporating global shape representations along with hippocampus segmentations.
METHODS: The data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and was T1-weighted structural MRI from initial screening or 
baseline, including ADNI 1,2/GO and 3. DenseCNN2 was trained and evaluated with 
326 AD subjects and 607 CN hippocampus MRI using 5-fold cross-validation 
strategy. DenseCNN2 was compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning 
approaches for the task of AD classification.
RESULTS: We showed that DenseCNN2 with combined visual and global shape features 
performed better than deep learning models with visual or global shape features 
alone. DenseCNN2 achieved an average accuracy of 0.925, sensitivity of 0.882, 
specificity of 0.949, and area under curve (AUC) of 0.978, which are better than 
or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in AD classification. Data 
visualization analysis through 2D embedding of UMAP confirmed that global shape 
features improved class discrimination between AD and normal.
CONCLUSION: DenseCNN2, a lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model based 
on combined hippocampus segmentations and global shape features, achieved high 
performance and has potential as an efficient diagnostic tool for AD 
classification.

(CSF) biomarkers (Aβ, Tau, and pTau) and cognition across Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) spectrum.
METHODS: Forty-six cognitive normal (CN), 35 subjective memory complaint (SMC), 
41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 32 AD subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were obtained. Multivariable linear 
regression analyses were conducted to investigate the main effects and 
interaction of the APOE genotype and disease status on the insula functional 
connectivity (IFC) network. Mediation and moderation analysis were performed to 
investigate whether IFC strengths regulate the association between APOE 
genotype, CSF biomarkers and cognition. Additionally, the support vector machine 
(SVM) model integrating APOE genotype, CSF biomarkers, and neuroimaging 
biomarkers (insula volumes and altered regional IFCs) was used to classify the 
AD spectrum.
RESULTS: The interactive effect of the APOE genotype and disease on the insula 
network was found in the left medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.L), right 
anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC.R), and bilateral thalamus (THA.B). The 
functional connectivities (FCs) in the left insula (LIns) connecting with the 
left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG.L), SFGmed.L, and right lingual gyrus 
(LING.R) were correlated with cognition. LIns-SFGmed.L and LIns-pMTG.L FCs could 
moderate the effects of Tau on cognition. Furthermore, LIns-SFGmed.L FC may 
suppress the association between APOE genotype and cognition. More importantly, 
the integrated biomarkers from the SVM model yielded strong powers for 
classifying the AD spectrum.
CONCLUSIONS: Insula functional connectivity regulated the association between 
APOE genotype, CSF Tau and cognition and provided stage-dependent biomarkers for 
early differentiation of the AD spectrum. The present study used a 
cross-sectional design. Follow-up studies are needed to validate the 
relationship.

BACKGROUND: Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with worse 
outcomes, yet no established biomarkers exist for early diagnosis and 
intervention. We compared tau PET burden across older individuals with and 
without psychotic symptoms.
METHODS: [18F]AV1451 tau PET binding was compared between 26 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects with psychotic symptoms (delusions 
and/or hallucinations) and 26 ADNI subjects without psychotic symptoms, matched 
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and clinical severity. Tau was assessed on a 
region-of-interest and voxel level, corrected for amyloid PET burden.
RESULTS: Tau was greater in individuals with psychotic symptoms in the amygdala 
in region-of-interest analyses, and in amygdala, thalamus, putamen, right 
hippocampus, right entorhinal cortex, and right frontal cortex in voxel-based 
analyses. When considering different onset and type of psychotic symptoms, tau 
binding was greatest in those with concurrent delusions.
CONCLUSION: Elevated tau in limbic regions may be relevant for psychotic 
symptoms in aging and AD.

Medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures are the earliest regions affected by 
neurofibrillary tangle pathology-and thus are promising biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, automatic segmentation of the MTL using only 
T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging due to the 
large anatomical variability of the MTL cortex and the confound of the dura 
mater, which is commonly segmented as gray matter by state-of-the-art algorithms 
because they have similar intensity in T1w MRI. To address these challenges, we 
developed a novel atlas set, consisting of 15 cognitively normal older adults 
and 14 patients with mild cognitive impairment with a label explicitly assigned 
to the dura, that can be used by the multiatlas automated pipeline (Automatic 
Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields [ASHS-T1]) for the segmentation of MTL 
subregions, including anterior/posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (ERC), 
Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, and parahippocampal cortex on T1w MRI. 
Cross-validation experiments indicated good segmentation accuracy of ASHS-T1 and 
that the dura can be reliably separated from the cortex (6.5% mislabeled as gray 
matter). Conversely, FreeSurfer segmented majority of the dura mater (62.4%) as 
gray matter and the degree of dura mislabeling decreased with increasing disease 
severity. To evaluate its clinical utility, we applied the pipeline to T1w 
images of 663 ADNI subjects and significant volume/thickness loss is observed in 
BA35, ERC, and posterior hippocampus in early prodromal AD and all subregions at 
later stages. As such, the publicly available new atlas and ASHS-T1 could have 
important utility in the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD and enhancing 
brain-behavior studies of these regions.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine whether newly introduced biomarkers 
Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), 
synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), and neurogranin (NG) in 
cerebrospinal fluid are useful in evaluating the asymptomatic and early 
symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It further aims to shed new 
insight into the differences between stable subjects and those who progress to 
AD by associating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and specific magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) regions with disease progression, more deeply exploring 
how such biomarkers relate to AD pathology.
METHODS: We examined baseline and longitudinal changes over a 7-year span and 
the longitudinal interactions between CSF and MRI biomarkers for subjects from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We stratified all CSF 
(140) and MRI (525) cohort participants into five diagnostic groups (including 
converters) further dichotomized by CSF amyloid beta (Aβ) status. Linear mixed 
models were used to compare within-person rates of change across diagnostic 
groups and to evaluate the association of CSF biomarkers as predictors of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers. CSF biomarkers and disease-prone 
MRI regions are assessed for CSF proteins levels and brain structural changes.
RESULTS: VILIP-1 and SNAP-25 displayed within-person increments in early 
symptomatic, amyloid-positive groups. CSF amyloid-positive (Aβ+) subjects showed 
elevated baseline levels of total tau (tTau), phospho-tau181 (pTau), VILIP-1, 
and NG. YKL-40, SNAP-25, and NG are positively intercorrelated. Aβ+ subjects 
showed negative MRI biomarker changes. YKL-40, tTau, pTau, and VILIP-1 are 
longitudinally associated with MRI biomarkers atrophy.
DISCUSSION: Converters (CNc, MCIc) highlight the evolution of biomarkers during 
the disease progression. Results show that underlying amyloid pathology is 
associated with accelerated cognitive impairment. CSF levels of Aβ42, pTau, 
tTau, VILIP-1, and SNAP-25 show utility to discriminate between mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) converter and control subjects (CN). Higher levels of YKL-40 in 
the Aβ+ group were longitudinally associated with declines in temporal pole and 
entorhinal thickness. Increased levels of tTau, pTau, and VILIP-1 in the Aβ+ 
groups were longitudinally associated with declines in hippocampal volume. These 
CSF biomarkers should be used in assessing the characterization of the AD 
progression.

Accurate and automatic segmentation of the hippocampus plays a vital role in the 
diagnosis and treatment of nervous system diseases. However, due to the 
anatomical variability of different subjects, the registered atlas images are 
not always perfectly aligned with the target image. This makes the segmentation 
of the hippocampus still face great challenges. In this paper, we propose a 
robust discriminative label fusion method under the multi-atlas framework. It is 
a patch embedding label fusion method based on conditional random field (CRF) 
model that integrates the metric learning and the graph cuts by an integrated 
formulation. Unlike most current label fusion methods with fixed (non-learning) 
distance metrics, a novel distance metric learning is presented to enhance 
discriminative observation and embed it into the unary potential function. In 
particular, Bayesian inference is utilized to extend a classic distance metric 
learning, in which large margin constraints are instead of pairwise constraints 
to obtain a more robust distance metric. And the pairwise homogeneity is fully 
considered in the spatial prior term based on classification labels and voxel 
intensity. The resulting integrated formulation is globally minimized by the 
efficient graph cuts algorithm. Further, sparse patch based method is utilized 
to polish the obtained segmentation results in label space. The proposed method 
is evaluated on IABA dataset and ADNI dataset for hippocampus segmentation. The 
Dice scores achieved by our method are 87.2%, 87.8%, 88.2% and 88.9% on left and 
right hippocampus on both two datasets, while the best Dice scores obtained by 
other methods are 86.0%, 86.9%, 86.8% and 88.0% on IABA dataset and ADNI dataset 
respectively. Experiments show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than 
state-of-the-art methods. We hope the proposed model can be transferred to 
combine with other promising distance measurement algorithms.

BACKGROUND: The change in volume of anatomic structures is as a sensitive 
indicator of Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. Although several methods are 
available to measure brain volumes, improvements in speed and automation are 
required. Our objective was to develop a fully automated, fast, and reliable 
approach to measure change in medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume, including 
primarily hippocampus.
METHODS: The MTL volume defined in an atlas image was propagated onto each 
baseline image and a level set algorithm was applied to refine the shape and 
smooth the boundary. The MTL of the baseline image was then mapped onto the 
corresponding follow-up image to measure volume change (ΔMTL). Baseline and 24 
months 3D T1-weighted images from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were randomly selected for 50 normal elderly controls (NECs), 50 subjects 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 50 subjects with AD to test the 
algorithm. The method was compared to the FreeSurfer segmentation tools.
RESULTS: The average ΔMTL (mean±SEM) was 68±35mm(3) in NEC, 187±38mm(3) in MCI 
and 300±34mm(3) in the AD group and was significantly different (p<0.0001) 
between all three groups. The ΔMTL was correlated with cognitive decline.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Results for the FreeSurfer software were 
similar but did not detect significant differences between the MCI and AD 
groups.
CONCLUSION: This novel segmentation approach is fully automated and provides a 
robust marker of brain atrophy that shows different rates of atrophy over 2 
years between NEC, MCI, and AD groups.

A robust cascaded deep learning framework with integrated hippocampal gray 
matter (HGM) probability map was developed to improve the hippocampus 
segmentation (called HGM-cNet) due to its significance in various 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Particularly, the 
HGM-cNet cascaded two identical convolutional neural networks (CNN), where each 
CNN was devised by incorporating Attention Block, Residual Block, and DropBlock 
into the typical encoder-decoder architecture. The two CNNs were skip-connected 
between encoder components at each scale. The adoption of the cascaded deep 
learning framework was to conveniently incorporate the HGM probability map with 
the feature map generated by the first CNN. Experiments on 135T1-weighted MRI 
scans and manual hippocampal labels from publicly available ADNI-HarP dataset 
demonstrated that the proposed HGM-cNet outperformed seven multi-atlas-based 
hippocampus segmentation methods and six deep learning methods under comparison 
in most evaluation metrics. The Dice (average > 0.89 for both left and right 
hippocampus) was increased by around or more than 1% over other methods. The 
HGM-cNet also achieved a superior hippocampus segmentation performance in each 
group of cognitive normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. The stability, 
conveniences and generalizability of the cascaded deep learning framework with 
integrated HGM probability map in improving hippocampus segmentation was 
validated by replacing the proposed CNN with 3D-UNet, Atten-UNet, HippoDeep, 
QuickNet, DeepHarp, and TransBTS models. The integration of the HGM probability 
map in the cascaded deep learning framework was also demonstrated to facilitate 
capturing hippocampal atrophy more accurately than alternative methods in AD 
analysis. The codes are publicly available at 
https://github.com/Liu1436510768/HGM-cNet.git.

Although beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are a primary diagnostic criterion for 
Alzheimer's disease, this pathology is commonly observed in the brains of 
non-demented older individuals. To explore the importance of this pathology in 
the absence of dementia, we compared levels of amyloid deposition (via 
'Pittsburgh Compound-B' (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging) to 
hippocampus volume (HV) and episodic memory (EM) in three groups: (i) normal 
controls (NC) from the Berkeley Aging Cohort (BAC NC, n = 20); (ii) normal 
controls (NC) from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI NC, n = 
17); and (iii) PIB+ mild cognitive impairment subjects from the ADNI (ADNI PIB+ 
MCI, n = 39). Age, gender and education were controlled for in each statistical 
model, and HV was adjusted for intracranial volume (aHV). In BAC NC, elevated 
PIB uptake was significantly associated with smaller aHV (P = 0.0016) and worse 
EM (P = 0.0086). Within ADNI NC, elevated PIB uptake was significantly 
associated with smaller aHV (P = 0.047) but not EM (P = 0.60); within ADNI PIB+ 
MCI, elevated PIB uptake was significantly associated with both smaller aHV (P = 
0.00070) and worse EM (P = 0.046). To further understand these relationships, a 
recursive regression procedure was conducted within all ADNI NC and PIB+ MCI 
subjects (n = 56) to test the hypothesis that HV mediates the relationship 
between Abeta and EM. Significant correlations were found between PIB index and 
EM (P = 0.0044), PIB index and aHV (P < 0.0001), as well as between aHV and EM 
(P < 0.0001). When both aHV and PIB were included in the same model to predict 
EM, aHV remained significant (P = 0.0015) whereas PIB index was no longer 
significantly associated with EM (P = 0.50). These results are consistent with a 
model in which Abeta deposition, hippocampal atrophy, and EM occur sequentially 
in elderly subjects, with Abeta deposition as the primary event in this cascade. 
This pattern suggests that declining EM in older individuals may be caused by 
Abeta-induced hippocampus atrophy.

BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is vital for early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, though confirming specific biomarkers 
remains challenging. Our proposed Multi-Scale Self-Attention Network (MUSAN) 
enhances classification of cognitively normal (CN) and AD individuals, 
distinguishing stable (sMCI) from progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI).
OBJECTIVE: This study leverages AD structural atrophy properties to achieve 
precise AD classification, combining different scales of brain region features. 
The ultimate goal is an interpretable algorithm for this method.
METHODS: The MUSAN takes whole-brain sMRI as input, enabling automatic 
extraction of brain region features and modeling of correlations between 
different scales of brain regions, and achieves personalized disease 
interpretation of brain regions. Furthermore, we also employed an occlusion 
sensitivity algorithm to localize and visualize brain regions sensitive to 
disease.
RESULTS: Our method is applied to ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3, and achieves high 
performance on the classification of CN from AD with accuracy (0.93), 
specificity (0.82), sensitivity (0.96), and area under curve (AUC) (0.95), as 
well as notable performance on the distinguish of sMCI from pMCI with accuracy 
(0.85), specificity (0.84), sensitivity (0.74), and AUC (0.86). Our sensitivity 
masking algorithm identified key regions in distinguishing CN from AD: 
hippocampus, amygdala, and vermis. Moreover, cingulum, pallidum, and inferior 
frontal gyrus are crucial for sMCI and pMCI discrimination. These discoveries 
align with existing literature, confirming the dependability of our model in AD 
research.
CONCLUSION: Our method provides an effective AD diagnostic and conversion 
prediction method. The occlusion sensitivity algorithm enhances deep learning 
interpretability, bolstering AD research reliability.

AIM: To identify the factors protecting Abeta-positive subjects with normal 
cognition (NC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from conversion to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: Subjects with MCI in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, with baseline data for neuropsychological tests, brain beta 
amyloid (Abeta), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), APOE genotyping, and 
18F-FDG-PET (FDG), were included for analysis.
RESULTS: Elevated brain amyloid was associated with a higher risk of conversion 
from MCI to AD (41.5%) relative to Abeta levels of <1.231 (5.5%) but was not 
associated with conversion from NC to AD (0.0 vs. 1.4%). In the multivariate Cox 
regression analyses, elevated Abeta increased the risk of AD, while higher 
whole-brain cerebral glucose metabolism (CGM) assessed by FDG decreased the risk 
of AD in subjects with the same amount of Abeta. Even in the patients with 
heavily elevated brain amyloid, those with FDG > 5.946 had a lower risk of AD. 
ApoE4 carrier status did not influence the protective effect.
CONCLUSION: Higher average CGM based on FDG modified the progression to AD, 
indicating a protective function. The results suggest that the inclusion of this 
CGM measured by FDG would enrich clinical trial design and that increasing CGM 
along with the use of anti-Abeta agents might be a potential prevention strategy 
for AD.

Pattern classification methods have been widely investigated for analysis of 
brain images to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early 
stage such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By considering the nature of 
pathological changes, a large number of features related to both local brain 
regions and interbrain regions can be extracted for classification. However, it 
is challenging to design a single global classifier to integrate all these 
features for effective classification, due to the issue of small sample size. To 
this end, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification method to combine 
multilevel classifiers by gradually integrating a large number of features from 
both local brain regions and interbrain regions. Thus, the large-scale 
classification problem can be divided into a set of small-scale and 
easier-to-solve problems in a bottom-up and local-to-global fashion, for more 
accurate classification. To demonstrate its performance, we use the spatially 
normalized grey matter (GM) of each MR brain image as imaging features. 
Specifically, we first partition the whole brain image into a number of local 
brain regions and, for each brain region, we build two low-level classifiers to 
transform local imaging features and the inter-region correlations into 
high-level features. Then, we generate multiple high-level classifiers, with 
each evaluating the high-level features from the respective brain regions. 
Finally, we combine the outputs of all high-level classifiers for making a final 
classification. Our method has been evaluated using the baseline MR images of 
652 subjects (including 198 AD patients, 225 MCI patients, and 229 normal 
controls (NC)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. The experimental results show that our classification method can 
achieve the accuracies of 92.0% and 85.3% for classifications of AD versus NC 
and MCI versus NC, respectively, demonstrating very promising classification 
performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification methods.

BACKGROUND: A globally harmonized protocol (HarP) for manual hippocampal 
segmentation based on magnetic resonance has been recently developed by a task 
force from European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC) and Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our aim was to produce benchmark labels 
based on the HarP for manual segmentation.
METHODS: Five experts of manual hippocampal segmentation underwent specific 
training on the HarP and segmented 40 right and left hippocampi from 10 ADNI 
subjects on both 1.5 T and 3 T scans. An independent expert visually checked 
segmentations for compliance with the HarP. Descriptive measures of agreement 
between tracers were intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of crude volumes 
and similarity coefficients of three-dimensional volumes.
RESULTS: Two hundred labels have been provided for the 20 magnetic resonance 
images. Intra- and interrater ICCs were >0.94, and mean similarity coefficients 
were 1.5 T, 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.75); 3 T, 0.75 (95% CI, 
0.74-0.76).
CONCLUSION: Certified benchmark labels have been produced based on the HarP to 
be used for tracers' training and qualification.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to have international experts converge on a 
harmonized definition of whole hippocampus boundaries and segmentation 
procedures, to define standard operating procedures for magnetic resonance 
(MR)-based manual hippocampal segmentation.
METHODS: The panel received a questionnaire regarding whole hippocampus 
boundaries and segmentation procedures. Quantitative information was supplied to 
allow evidence-based answers. A recursive and anonymous Delphi procedure was 
used to achieve convergence. Significance of agreement among panelists was 
assessed by exact probability on Fisher's and binomial tests.
RESULTS: Agreement was significant on the inclusion of alveus/fimbria (P = 
.021), whole hippocampal tail (P = .013), medial border of the body according to 
visible morphology (P = .0006), and on this combined set of features (P = .001). 
This definition captures 100% of hippocampal tissue, 100% of Alzheimer's 
disease-related atrophy, and demonstrated good reliability on preliminary 
intrarater (0.98) and inter-rater (0.94) estimates.
DISCUSSION: Consensus was achieved among international experts with respect to 
hippocampal segmentation using MR resulting in a harmonized segmentation 
protocol.

In this paper, we investigate the connectivity alterations of the subcortical 
brain network due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mostly, the literature 
investigated AD connectivity abnormalities at the whole brain level or at the 
cortex level, while very few studies focused on the sub-network composed only by 
the subcortical regions, especially using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data. 
In this work, we examine a mixed cohort including 46 healthy controls (HC) and 
40 AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data 
set. We reconstruct the brain connectome through the use of state of the art 
tractography algorithms and we propose a method based on graph communicability 
to enhance the information content of subcortical brain regions in 
discriminating AD. We develop a classification framework, achieving 77% of area 
under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the binary 
discrimination AD vs. HC only using a 12 × 12 subcortical features matrix. We 
find some interesting AD-related connectivity patterns highlighting that 
subcortical regions tend to increase their communicability through cortical 
regions to compensate the physical connectivity reduction between them due to 
AD. This study also suggests that AD connectivity alterations mostly regard the 
inter-connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions rather than the 
intra-subcortical connectivity.

In the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one of the most important 
tasks is evaluating its severity for diagnosis and therapy. However, traditional 
testing methods are deficient, such as their susceptibility to subjective 
factors, incomplete evaluation, low accuracy, or insufficient granularity, 
resulting in unreliable evaluation scores. To address these issues, we propose 
an objective dementia severity scale based on MRI (ODSS-MRI) using contrastive 
learning to automatically evaluate the neurological function of patients. The 
approach utilizes a deep learning framework and a contrastive learning strategy 
to mine relevant information from structural magnetic resonance images to obtain 
the patient's neurological function level score. Given that the model is driven 
by the patient's whole brain imaging data, but without any possible biased 
manual intervention or instruction from the physician or patient, it provides a 
comprehensive and objective evaluation of the patient's neurological function. 
We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset, and the results showed that the proposed ODSS-MRI was correlated 
with the stages of AD 88.55% better than all existing methods. This demonstrates 
its efficacy to describe the neurological function changes of patients during AD 
progression. It also outperformed traditional psychiatric rating scales in 
discriminating different stages of AD, which is indicative of its superiority 
for neurological function evaluation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of computational 
algorithm, measurement variability, and cut point on hippocampal volume 
(HCV)-based patient selection for clinical trials in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). We used normal control and amnestic MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) as normative reference and screening 
cohorts. We evaluated the enrichment performance of 4 widely used hippocampal 
segmentation algorithms (FreeSurfer, Hippocampus Multi-Atlas Propagation and 
Segmentation (HMAPS), Learning Embeddings Atlas Propagation (LEAP), and 
NeuroQuant) in terms of 2-year changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We modeled the implications for sample 
size, screen fail rates, and trial cost and duration. HCV based patient 
selection yielded reduced sample sizes (by ∼40%-60%) and lower trial costs (by 
∼30%-40%) across a wide range of cut points. These results provide a guide to 
the choice of HCV cut point for amnestic MCI clinical trials, allowing an 
informed tradeoff between statistical and practical considerations.

It has been increasingly evident that pulse pressure (PP) is associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) but whether PP increases AD risk and the mechanism 
responsible for this association remains unclear. To investigate the effects of 
PP in the process of AD, we have evaluated the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations of PP with AD biomarkers, brain structure and cognition and have 
assessed the effect of PP on AD risk in a large sample (n= 1,375) from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Multiple linear regression 
and mixed-model regression were employed in cross-sectional and longitudinal 
analyses respectively. Clinical disease progression was assessed using Cox 
proportional hazards models. High PP was associated with lower β-amyloid 42 
(Aβ42) (P= .015), and higher total tau (T-tau) (P= .011), phosphorylated tau 
(P-tau) (P= .003), T-tau/Aβ42 (P= .004) and P-tau/Aβ42 (P = .001), as well as 
heavier cortical amyloid-beta burden (P= .011). Longitudinally, baseline high PP 
was significantly associated with hippocampal atrophy (P= .039), entorhinal 
atrophy (P= .031) and worse memory performance (P= .058). Baseline high PP 
showed more rapid progression than those with normal PP (P <.001). These results 
suggest PP elevation could increase AD risk, which may be driven by amyloid 
plaques and subclinical neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD) is prevalent in older 
adults. However, it remains unclear whether there are effects of SSD on brain 
aging outcomes (cognition and brain structures), especially in the presence of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology.
METHODS: A total of 1,188 adults without dementia were recruited from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Participants with 
SSD were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). In 
multivariable models, the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of SSD 
with brain aging outcomes were explored. We further evaluated whether baseline 
amyloid-β (Aβ) load modifies the relations between SSD and brain aging outcomes.
RESULTS: SSD at baseline was associated with significantly longitudinal decline 
in cognition and displayed significantly accelerated atrophy in hippocampus 
(β = -29.53, p = 0.001) and middle temporal gyrus (β = - 77.82, p = 0.006) among 
all participants and Aβ-Positive individuals. SSD interacted with baseline Aβ 
load in predicting longitudinal decline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
(β = - 0.327, p = 0.023), episodic memory (β = -0.065, p = 0.004) and increase 
in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognition 13-item scale (ADAS-cog13) 
(β = 0.754, p = 0.026).
LIMITATIONS: Our study didn't look at AD diagnosis but Aβ status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that older people without dementia with both 
SSD and a high level of Aβ load may have higher risk of cognitive deterioration 
and brain atrophy. Therapeutic mitigation of depressive symptoms, especially in 
those with abnormal Aβ levels, may help delay progressive decline in cognition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and stroke risk factors independently 
predict cognitive impairment, likely through independent disease pathways. 
However, limited work has sought to describe the dynamic interplay between these 
important risk factors. This article evaluated the interaction between stroke 
risk and AD biomarkers on hippocampal volume and cognitive performance. We first 
evaluated the interaction between stroke risk factors and AD biomarkers using 
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 1202). We 
then extended our findings to an independent autopsy data set from the National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 1122) using measures of AD pathology. 
Stroke risk was quantified using the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile. In ADNI, 
stroke risk interacted with tau and amyloid levels in relation to baseline and 
longitudinal cognitive performance. Similarly, in NACC, stroke risk interacted 
with amyloid and tau positivity on cognitive performance. The effect of stroke 
risk factors on cognition was strongest in the absence of AD biomarkers or 
neuropathology, providing additional evidence that AD biomarkers and stroke risk 
factors relate to cognition through independent pathways.

MAD-Former: A Traceable Interpretability Model for Alzheimer's Disease 
Recognition Based on Multi-Patch Attention.

Ye J, Zeng A, Pan D, Zhang Y, Zhao J, Chen Q, Liu Y.

The integration of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep 
learning techniques is one of the important research directions for the 
automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the satisfactory 
performance achieved by existing voxel-based models based on convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs), such models only handle AD-related brain atrophy at a 
single spatial scale and lack spatial localization of abnormal brain regions 
based on model interpretability. To address the above limitations, we propose a 
traceable interpretability model for AD recognition based on multi-patch 
attention (MAD-Former). MAD-Former consists of two parts: recognition and 
interpretability. In the recognition part, we design a 3D brain feature 
extraction network to extract local features, followed by constructing a 
dual-branch attention structure with different patch sizes to achieve global 
feature extraction, forming a multi-scale spatial feature extraction framework. 
Meanwhile, we propose an important attention similarity position loss function 
to assist in model decision-making. The interpretability part proposes a 
traceable method that can obtain a 3D ROI space through attention-based 
selection and receptive field tracing. This space encompasses key brain tissues 
that influence model decisions. Experimental results reveal the significant role 
of brain tissues such as the Fusiform Gyrus (FuG) in AD recognition. MAD-Former 
achieves outstanding performance in different tasks on ADNI and OASIS datasets, 
demonstrating reliable model interpretability.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between subregion atrophy in the entire temporal 
lobe and subcortical nuclei and cognitive decline at various stages of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear.
METHODS: We selected 711 participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database, which included 195 cases of cognitively normal (CN), 271 cases of 
early Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI), 132 cases of late MCI (LMCI), and 
113 cases of AD. we looked at how subregion atrophy in the temporal lobe and 
subcortical nuclei correlated with cognition at different stages of AD. The 
volume of the subregions was measured from the human Brainnetome atlas (BNA-246) 
using voxel-based morphometry and discriminant and correlation analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Only the left premotor thalamus demonstrated significant shrinkage in 
individuals with EMCI (p = 0.012). Discriminant analysis revealed that the left 
rostral Brodmann area 20 has the highest discriminatory ability among all 
temporal subregions to distinguish patients with AD from CN. While the left 
caudal hippocampus can efficiently distinguish patients with LMCI from EMCI. 
While the right rostral Brodmann area 20 was the most effective in 
distinguishing AD from LMCI. Correlation analysis revealed that the left nucleus 
accumbens, left caudal area 35/36, and left sensory thalamus had a mild 
correlation with cognitive scores measured using the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) 13 and Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the right rostral area 20 in the inferior 
temporal gyrus plays a significant role in cognitive impairment in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), such as depression and anxiety, 
are observed in 90% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, two-thirds of whom are 
women. NPS usually manifest long before AD onset creating a therapeutic 
opportunity. Here, we examined the impact of anxiety on AD progression and the 
underlying brain-wide neuronal mechanisms.
METHODS: To gain mechanistic insight into how anxiety impacts AD progression, we 
performed a cross-sectional analysis on mood, cognition, and neural activity 
utilizing the ArcCreERT2 x enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) x APP/PS1 
(AD) mice. The ADNI dataset was used to determine the impact of anxiety on AD 
progression in human subjects.
RESULTS: Female AD mice exhibited anxiety-like behavior and cognitive decline at 
an earlier age than control (Ctrl) mice and male mice. Brain-wide analysis of 
c-Fos+ revealed changes in regional correlations and overall network 
connectivity in AD mice. Sex-specific memory trace changes were observed; female 
AD mice exhibited impaired memory traces in dorsal CA3 (dCA3), while male AD 
mice exhibited impaired memory traces in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG). In the 
ADNI dataset, anxiety predicted transition to dementia. Female subjects positive 
for anxiety and amyloid transitioned more quickly to dementia than male 
subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: While future studies are needed to understand whether anxiety is a 
predictor, a neuropsychiatric biomarker, or a comorbid symptom that occurs 
during disease onset, these results suggest that AD network dysfunction is 
sexually dimorphic, and that personalized medicine may benefit male and female 
AD patients rather than a one size fits all approach.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a gradual breakdown of brain connectivity, and 
network analyses offer a promising new approach to track and understand disease 
progression. Even so, our ability to detect degenerative changes in brain 
networks depends on the methods used. Here we compared several tractography and 
feature extraction methods to see which ones gave best diagnostic classification 
for 202 people with AD, mild cognitive impairment or normal cognition, scanned 
with 41-gradient diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging as part of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We computed brain 
networks based on whole brain tractography with nine different methods - four of 
them tensor-based deterministic (FACT, RK2, SL, and TL), two orientation 
distribution function (ODF)-based deterministic (FACT, RK2), two ODF-based 
probabilistic approaches (Hough and PICo), and one "ball-and-stick" approach 
(Probtrackx). Brain networks derived from different tractography algorithms did 
not differ in terms of classification performance on ADNI, but performing 
principal components analysis on networks helped classification in some cases. 
Small differences may still be detectable in a truly vast cohort, but these 
experiments help assess the relative advantages of different tractography 
algorithms, and different post-processing choices, when used for classification.

The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge 
compares the performance of algorithms at predicting the future evolution of 
individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease. TADPOLE Challenge participants train 
their models and algorithms on historical data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants are then required to make 
forecasts of three key outcomes for ADNI-3 rollover participants: clinical 
diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog 
13), and total volume of the ventricles - which are then compared with future 
measurements. Strong points of the challenge are that the test data did not 
exist at the time of forecasting (it was acquired afterwards), and that it 
focuses on the challenging problem of cohort selection for clinical trials by 
identifying fast progressors. The submission phase of TADPOLE was open until 15 
November 2017; since then data has been acquired until April 2019 from 219 
subjects with 223 clinical visits and 150 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
scans, which was used for the evaluation of the participants' predictions. 
Thirty-three teams participated with a total of 92 submissions. No single 
submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For diagnosis prediction, 
the best forecast (team Frog), which was based on gradient boosting, obtained a 
multiclass area under the receiver-operating curve (MAUC) of 0.931, while for 
ventricle prediction the best forecast (team EMC1 ), which was based on disease 
progression modelling and spline regression, obtained mean absolute error of 
0.41% of total intracranial volume (ICV). For ADAS-Cog 13, no forecast was 
considerably better than the benchmark mixed effects model (BenchmarkME ), 
provided to participants before the submission deadline. Further analysis can 
help understand which input features and algorithms are most suitable for 
Alzheimer's disease prediction and for aiding patient stratification in clinical 
trials. The submission system remains open via the website:

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the regional and global cerebral atrophy rates and assess 
acceleration rates in healthy controls, subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and subjects with mild Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: Using 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-month MRI scans of controls and 
subjects with MCI and AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, we calculated volume change of whole brain, hippocampus, and 
ventricles between all pairs of scans using the boundary shift integral.
RESULTS: We found no evidence of acceleration in whole-brain atrophy rates in 
any group. There was evidence that hippocampal atrophy rates in MCI subjects 
accelerate by 0.22%/year2 on average (p = 0.037). There was evidence of 
acceleration in rates of ventricular enlargement in subjects with MCI (p = 
0.001) and AD (p < 0.001), with rates estimated to increase by 0.27 mL/year2 
(95% confidence interval 0.12, 0.43) and 0.88 mL/year2 (95% confidence interval 
0.47, 1.29), respectively. A post hoc analysis suggested that the acceleration 
of hippocampal loss in MCI subjects was mainly driven by the MCI subjects that 
were observed to progress to clinical AD within 3 years of baseline, with this 
group showing hippocampal atrophy rate acceleration of 0.50%/year2 (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The small acceleration rates suggest a long period of transition to 
the pathologic losses seen in clinical AD. The acceleration in hippocampal 
atrophy rates in MCI subjects in the ADNI seems to be driven by those MCI 
subjects who concurrently progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD.

BACKGROUND: MRI magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition (MPRAGE) is an easily 
available imaging modality for dementia diagnosis. Previous studies suggested 
that volumetric analysis plays a crucial role in various stages of dementia 
classification. In this study, volumetry, radiomics and demographics were 
integrated as inputs to develop an artificial intelligence model for various 
stages, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive decline (MCI) and 
cognitive normal (CN) dementia classifications.
METHOD: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset was 
separated into training and testing groups, and the Open Access Series of 
Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset was used as the second testing group. The MRI 
MPRAGE image was reoriented via statistical parametric mapping (SPM12). 
Freesurfer was employed for brain segmentation, and 45 regional brain volumes 
were retrieved. The 3D Slicer software was employed for 107 radiomics feature 
extractions from within the whole brain. Data on patient demographics were 
collected from the datasets. The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and the 
other most common artificial intelligence algorithms, including support vector 
machine (SVM), ensemble classifier (EC) and decision tree (DT), were used to 
build the models using various features.
RESULTS: The integration of brain regional volumes, radiomics and patient 
demographics attained the highest overall accuracy at 76.57% and 73.14% in ADNI 
and OASIS testing, respectively. The subclass accuracies in MCI, AD and CN were 
78.29%, 89.71% and 85.14%, respectively, in ADNI testing, as well as 74.86%, 88% 
and 83.43% in OASIS testing. Balanced sensitivity and specificity were obtained 
for all subclass classifications in MCI, AD and CN.
CONCLUSION: The FFNN yielded good overall accuracy for MCI, AD and CN 
categorization, with balanced subclass accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. 
The proposed FFNN model is simple, and it may support the triage of patients for 
further confirmation of the diagnosis.

Medial temporal lobe (MTL) consists of hippocampal subfields and neighboring 
cortices. These heterogeneous structures are differentially involved in memory, 
cognitive and emotional functions, and present nonuniformly distributed atrophy 
contributing to cognitive disorders. This study aims to examine how genetics 
influences Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis via MTL substructures by 
analyzing high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We performed 
genome-wide association study to examine the associations between 565,373 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 14 MTL substructure volumes. A novel 
association with right Brodmann area 36 volume was discovered in an ERC1 SNP 
(i.e., rs2968869). Further analyses on larger samples found rs2968869 to be 
associated with gray matter density and glucose metabolism measures in the right 
hippocampus, and disease status. Tissue-specific transcriptomic analysis 
identified the minor allele of rs2968869 (rs2968869-C) to be associated with 
reduced ERC1 expression in the hippocampus. All the findings indicated a 
protective role of rs2968869-C in AD. We demonstrated the power of 
high-resolution MRI and the promise of fine-grained MTL substructures for 
revealing the genetic basis of AD biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, incurable 
neurodegenerative disease and the most common type of dementia. It cannot be 
prevented, cured or drastically slowed, even though AD research has increased in 
the past 5-10 years. Instead of focusing on the brain volume or on the single 
brain structures like hippocampus, this paper investigates the relationship and 
proximity between regions in the brain and uses this information as a novel way 
of classifying normal control (NC), mild cognitive impaired (MCI), and AD 
subjects.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort of 528 subjects (170 NC, 240 MCI, and 114 AD) 
from ADNI at baseline and month 12 was studied. We investigated a marker based 
on Procrustes aligned center of masses and the percentile surface connectivity 
between regions. These markers were classified using a linear discriminant 
analysis in a cross validation setting and compared to whole brain and 
hippocampus volume.
RESULTS: We found that both our markers was able to significantly classify the 
subjects. The surface connectivity marker showed the best results with an area 
under the curve (AUC) at 0.877 (p<0.001), 0.784 (p<0.001), 0,766 (p<0.001) for 
NC-AD, NC-MCI, and MCI-AD, respectively, for the functional regions in the 
brain. The surface connectivity marker was able to classify MCI-converters with 
an AUC of 0.599 (p<0.05) for the 1-year period.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that our relative proximity markers include more 
information than whole brain and hippocampus volume. Our results demonstrate

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success for image 
classification in medical research. Deep learning with brain imaging is the 
imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are "black boxes" owing to their 
low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning 
compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. 
To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that 
integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and 
genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed 
algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the 
brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic 
variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four 
time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The algorithm 
identified brain regions underlying AD consisting of the temporal lobes 
(including the hippocampus) and the ventricular system.

INTRODUCTION: It is important to study apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to 
better understand its underlying neurobiology and develop effective 
interventions. In the current study, we sought to examine the relationships 
between longitudinal apathy and regional tau burden in cognitively impaired 
older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database.
METHODS: Three hundred and nineteen ADNI participants with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD dementia underwent flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical assessment with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) annually. Longitudinal NPI Apathy (NPI-A) 
scores were examined in relation to baseline tau PET signal in three a priori 
selected regions implicated in AD and AD-related apathy (supramarginal gyrus, 
entorhinal cortex [EC] and rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC]). Secondary 
models were adjusted for global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) 
and cortical amyloid (florbetapir PET).
RESULTS: Higher baseline supramarginal gyrus and EC tau burden were each 
significantly associated with greater NPI-A over time, while rACC tau was 
associated with higher NPI-A but did not predict its trajectory over time. These 
results were retained for supramarginal and EC tau after adjusting models for 
global cognition and cortical amyloid.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that baseline in vivo tau burden in parietal 
and temporal brain regions affected in AD, and less so in a medial frontal 
region involved in motivational control, is associated with increasing apathy 
over time in older adults with MCI and AD dementia. Future work studying 
emergent apathy in relation to not only core AD pathology but also circuit level 
dysfunction may provide additional insight into the neurobiology of apathy in AD 
and opportunities for intervention.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau (Flortaucipir PET) in regions implicated in AD was associated 
with increasing apathy over timeCortical amyloid was also found to be a robust 
predictor of the trajectory of apathyEvidence of synergy between regional tau 
and amyloid in overall higher levels of apathy.

Machine learning and pattern recognition methods have been used to diagnose 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from individual MRI 
scans. Another application of such methods is to predict clinical scores from 
individual scans. Using relevance vector regression (RVR), we predicted 
individuals' performances on established tests from their MRI T1 weighted image 
in two independent data sets. From Mayo Clinic, 73 probable AD patients and 91 
cognitively normal (CN) controls completed the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) 
within 3months of their scan. Baseline MRI's from the Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprised the other data set; 113 AD, 351 MCI, 
and 122 CN subjects completed the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive subtest (ADAS-cog) and 39 AD, 92 MCI, and 32 CN ADNI subjects 
completed MMSE, ADAS-cog, and AVLT. Predicted and actual clinical scores were 
highly correlated for the MMSE, DRS, and ADAS-cog tests (P<0.0001). Training 
with one data set and testing with another demonstrated stability between data 
sets. DRS, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog correlated better than AVLT with whole brain grey 
matter changes associated with AD. This result underscores their utility for 
screening and tracking disease. RVR offers a novel way to measure interactions 
between structural changes and neuropsychological tests beyond that of 
univariate methods. In clinical practice, we envision using RVR to aid in 
diagnosis and predict clinical outcome.

We describe here a method, Quarc, for accurately quantifying structural changes 
in organs, based on serial MRI scans. The procedure can be used to measure 
deformations globally or in regions of interest (ROIs), including large-scale 
changes in the whole organ, and subtle changes in small-scale structures. We 
validate the method with model studies, and provide an illustrative analysis 
using the brain. We apply the method to the large, publicly available ADNI 
database of serial brain scans, and calculate Cohen's d effect sizes for several 
ROIs. Using publicly available derived-data, we directly compare effect sizes 
from Quarc with those from four existing methods that quantify cerebral 
structural change. Quarc produced a slightly improved, though not significantly 
different, whole brain effect size compared with the standard KN-BSI method, but 
in all other cases it produced significantly larger effect sizes.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The hippocampus is a widely recognized area of early 
change in AD, yet voxelwise analyses of FDG-PET activity differences between AD 
and CN controls have consistently failed to identify hippocampal hypometabolism. 
In this article, we propose a high-dimensional PET-specific analysis framework 
to determine whether important hippocampal metabolic FDG-PET activity 
differences between patients with AD and CN subjects are embedded in the 
Jacobian information generated during spatial normalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting FDG-PET data were obtained from 102 CN and 92 
participants with AD from the ADNI data base. A PET-study-specific template was 
constructed using symmetric diffeomorphic registration. Spatially normalized raw 
FDG maps, Jacobian determinant maps, and modulated maps were generated for all 
subjects. Statistical parametric mapping and tensor-based morphometry were 
performed, comparing patients with AD with CN subjects.
RESULTS: Whole-brain spatially normalized raw FDG maps demonstrated robust 
hypometabolism in cingulate gyrus and bilateral parietal areas. No hippocampal 
differences were present, except on ROI-based analyses with a hippocampal mask. 
Whole-brain modulated maps demonstrated robust bilateral hippocampal 
hypometabolism, and some hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate. Tensor-based 
morphometry demonstrated robust hippocampal differences only.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that hippocampal metabolic differences 
are embedded in the Jacobian information from the spatial normalization 
procedure. We introduce a voxelwise PET-specific analysis framework based on the 
use of a PET-population-specific template, high-dimensional symmetric 
diffeomorphic normalization, and the use of Jacobian information, which can 
provide substantially increased statistical power and an order of magnitude 
decrease in imaging costs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder impairing 
multiple domains, for example, cognition and behavior. Assessing the risk of AD 
progression and initiating timely interventions at early stages are critical to 
improve the quality of life for AD patients. Due to the heterogeneous nature and 
complex mechanisms of AD, one single longitudinal outcome is insufficient to 
assess AD severity and disease progression. Therefore, AD studies collect 
multiple longitudinal outcomes, including cognitive and behavioral measurements, 
as well as structural brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). How 
to utilize the multivariate longitudinal outcomes and MRI data to make efficient 
statistical inference and prediction is an open question. In this article, we 
propose a multivariate joint model with functional data (MJM-FD) framework that 
relates multiple correlated longitudinal outcomes to a survival outcome, and use 
the scalar-on-function regression method to include voxel-based whole-brain MRI 
data as functional predictors in both longitudinal and survival models. We adopt 
a Bayesian paradigm to make statistical inference and develop a dynamic 
prediction framework to predict an individual's future longitudinal outcomes and 
risk of a survival event. We validate the MJM-FD framework through extensive 
simulation studies and apply it to the motivating Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study.

BACKGROUND: The use of hippocampal volumetry as a biomarker for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) requires that tracers from different laboratories comply with the 
same segmentation method. Here we present a platform for training and qualifying 
new tracers to perform the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on magnetic 
resonance images (MRI) following the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium and 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (EADC-ADNI) Harmonized Protocol 
(HarP). Our objective was to demonstrate that the training process embedded in 
the platform leads to increased compliance and qualification with the HarP.
METHOD: Thirteen new tracers' segmentations were compared with benchmark images 
with respect to: (a) absolute segmentation volume; (b) spatial overlap of 
contour with the reference using the Jaccard similarity index; and (c) spatial 
distance of contour with the reference. Point by point visual feedback was 
provided through three training phases on 10 MRI. Tracers were then tested on 10 
different MRIs in the qualification phase.
RESULTS: Statistical testing of training over three phases showed a significant 
increase of Jaccard (i.e. mean Jaccard overlap P < .001) between phases on 
average for all raters, demonstrating that training positively increased 
compliance with the HarP. Based on these results we defined qualification 
thresholds which all tracers were able to meet.
CONCLUSIONS: This platform is an adequate infrastructure allowing standardized 
training and evaluation of tracers' compliance with the HarP. This is a 
necessary step allowing the use of hippocampal volumetry as a biomarker for AD 
in clinical and research centers.

Current state-of-the-art methods for whole and subfield hippocampus segmentation 
use pre-segmented templates, also known as atlases, in the pre-processing 
stages. Typically, the input image is registered to the template, which provides 
prior information for the segmentation process. Using a single standard atlas 
increases the difficulty in dealing with individuals who have a brain anatomy 
that is morphologically different from the atlas, especially in older brains. To 
increase the segmentation precision in these cases, without any manual 
intervention, multiple atlases can be used. However, registration to many 
templates leads to a high computational cost. Researchers have proposed to use 
an atlas pre-selection technique based on meta-information followed by the 
selection of an atlas based on image similarity. Unfortunately, this method also 
presents a high computational cost due to the image-similarity process. Thus, it 
is desirable to pre-select a smaller number of atlases as long as this does not 
impact on the segmentation quality. To pick out an atlas that provides the best 
registration, we evaluate the use of three meta-information parameters (medical 
condition, age range, and gender) to choose the atlas. In this work, 24 atlases 
were defined and each is based on the combination of the three meta-information 
parameters. These atlases were used to segment 352 vol from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Hippocampus segmentation with 
each of these atlases was evaluated and compared to reference segmentations of 
the hippocampus, which are available from ADNI. The use of atlas selection by 
meta-information led to a significant gain in the Dice similarity coefficient, 
which reached 0.68 ± 0.11, compared to 0.62 ± 0.12 when using only the standard 
MNI152 atlas. Statistical analysis showed that the three meta-information 
parameters provided a significant improvement in the segmentation accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Textural features of the hippocampus in structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (sMRI) images can serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), while exhibiting a relatively poor discriminant 
performance in detecting early AD, such as amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(aMCI). In contrast to sMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can 
identify brain functional abnormalities in the early stages of cerebral 
disorders. However, whether the textural features reflecting local functional 
activity in the hippocampus can improve the diagnostic performance for AD and 
aMCI remains unclear. In this study, we combined the textural features of the 
amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the slow-5 frequency band and 
structural images in the hippocampus to investigate their diagnostic performance 
for AD and aMCI using multimodal radiomics technique.
METHODS: Totally, 84 AD, 50 aMCI, and 44 normal controls (NCs) were included in 
the current study. After feature extraction and feature selection, the radiomics 
models incorporating sMRI images, ALFF values and their combinations in the 
bilateral hippocampus were established for the diagnosis of AD and aMCI. The 
effectiveness of these models was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analysis. The radiomics models were further validated using the external 
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
RESULTS: The results of ROC analysis showed that the radiomics models based on 
structural images in the hippocampus had a better diagnostic performance for AD 
compared with the models using ALFF, while the ALFF-based model exhibited better 
discriminant performance for aMCI than the models with structural images. The 
radiomics models based on the combinations of structural images and ALFF were 
found to exhibit the highest accuracy for distinguishing AD from NCs and aMCI 
from NCs.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that the textural features reflecting local 
functional activity could improve the diagnostic performance of traditional 
structural models for both AD and aMCI. These findings may deepen our 
understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, contributing to the early diagnosis of 
AD.

Radiomics features as predictors to distinguish fast and slow progression of 
Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's disease.

Li Y, Jiang J, Shen T, Wu P, Zuo C.

Prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by 
analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image features has become popular in 
recent years. However, defining effective predictive biomarkers is still 
challengeable. The 'radiomics' is an established method to identify advanced and 
high order quantitative imaging features for computer-aided diagnosis and has 
been applied into oncology study. However, it has not been applied into brain 
disorder disease study. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify 
whether the features from radiomics could be the predictors of the conversion 
from MCI to AD. We analyzed 197 samples with MRI scans from the ADNI database, 
which contained 32 healthy subjects and 165 MCI patients. Firstly, we extracted 
215 radiomics features from hippocampus. Then we used Cronbach's alpha 
coefficient, the intra-class correlation coefficient, Kaplan-Meier model and cox 
regression to select 44 radiomics features as effective features. Finally, we 
used SVM classification to validate these features. The results showed that the 
classification accuracy using linear, polynomial and sigmoid kernel could 
achieve 80.0%, 93.3% and 86.6% to distinguish MCI-to-AD fast and slow converter. 
As a result, this study indicated that the radiomics features are potential to 
be applied into predicting AD from MCI.

Time-dependent data collected in studies of Alzheimer's disease usually has 
missing and irregularly sampled data points. For this reason time series methods 
which assume regular sampling cannot be applied directly to the data without a 
pre-processing step. In this paper we use a random forest to learn the 
relationship between pairs of data points at different time separations. The 
input vector is a summary of the time series history and it includes both 
demographic and non-time varying variables such as genetic data. To test the 
method we use data from the TADPOLE grand challenge, an initiative which aims to 
predict the evolution of subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease using 
demographic, physical and cognitive input data. The task is to predict 
diagnosis, ADAS-13 score and normalised ventricles volume. While the competition 
proceeds, forecasting methods may be compared using a leaderboard dataset 
selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and with 
standard metrics for measuring accuracy. For diagnosis, we find an mAUC of 0.82, 
and a classification accuracy of 0.73 compared with a benchmark SVM predictor 
which gives mAUC = 0.62 and BCA = 0.52. The results show that the method is 
effective and comparable with other methods.

OBJECTIVE: This article investigates subjects aged 55 to 65 from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to broaden our understanding of 
early-onset (EO) cognitive impairment using neuroimaging and genetics 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Nine of the subjects had EO-AD (Alzheimer's disease) and 27 had EO-MCI 
(mild cognitive impairment). The 15 most important neuroimaging markers were 
extracted with the Global Shape Analysis (GSA) Pipeline workflow. The 20 most 
significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen and were 
associated with specific neuroimaging biomarkers.
RESULTS: We identified associations between the neuroimaging phenotypes and 
genotypes for a total of 36 subjects. Our results for all the subjects taken 
together showed the most significant associations between rs7718456 and 
L_hippocampus (volume), and between rs7718456 and R_hippocampus (volume). For 
the 27 MCI subjects, we found the most significant associations between 
rs6446443 and R_superior_frontal_gyrus (volume), and between rs17029131 and 
L_Precuneus (volume). For the nine AD subjects, we found the most significant 
associations between rs16964473 and L_rectus gyrus (surface area), and between 
rs12972537 and L_rectus_gyrus (surface area).
CONCLUSION: We observed significant correlations between the SNPs and the 
neuroimaging phenotypes in the 36 EO subjects in terms of neuroimaging genetics. 
However, larger sample sizes are needed to ensure that the effects will be 
detectable for a reasonable false-positive error rate using the GSA and Plink 
Pipeline workflows.

In mild cognitive impairment (MCI), small benefits from cognitive training were 
observed for memory functions but there appears to be great variability in the 
response to treatment. Our study aimed to improve the characterization and 
selection of those participants who will benefit from cognitive intervention. We 
evaluated the predictive value of disease-specific biological factors for the 
outcome after cognitive training in MCI (n = 25) and also considered motivation 
of the participants. We compared the results of the cognitive intervention group 
with two independent control groups of MCI patients (local memory clinic, 
n = 20; ADNI cohort, n = 302). The primary outcome measure was episodic memory 
as measured by verbal delayed recall of a 10-word list. Episodic memory remained 
stable after treatment and slightly increased 6 months after the intervention. 
In contrast, in MCI patients who did not receive an intervention, episodic 
memory significantly decreased during the same time interval. A larger left 
entorhinal cortex predicted more improvement in episodic memory after treatment 
and so did higher levels of motivation. Adding disease-specific biological 
factors significantly improved the prediction of training-related change 
compared to a model based simply on age and baseline performance. Bootstrapping 
with resampling (n = 1000) verified the stability of our finding. Cognitive 
training might be particularly helpful in individuals with a bigger left 
entorhinal cortex as individuals who did not benefit from intervention showed 
17% less volume in this area. When extended to alternative treatment options, 
stratification based on disease-specific biological factors is a useful step 
towards individualized medicine.

Recently, a group of major international experts have completed a comprehensive 
effort to efficiently define a harmonized protocol for manual hippocampal 
segmentation that is optimized for Alzheimer's research (known as the EADC-ADNI 
Harmonized Protocol (the HarP)). This study compares the HarP with one of the 
widely used hippocampal segmentation protocols (Pruessner, 2000), based on a 
single automatic segmentation method trained separately with libraries made from 
each manual segmentation protocol. The automatic segmentation conformity with 
the corresponding manual segmentation and the ability to capture Alzheimer's 
disease related hippocampal atrophy on large datasets are measured to compare 
the manual protocols. In addition to the possibility of harmonizing different 
procedures of hippocampal segmentation, our results show that using the HarP, 
the automatic segmentation conformity with manual segmentation is also preserved 
(Dice's κ=0.88,κ=0.87 for Pruessner and HarP respectively (p = 0.726 for common 
training library)). Furthermore, the results show that the HarP can capture the 
Alzheimer's disease related hippocampal volume differences in large datasets. 
The HarP-derived segmentation shows large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.5883) in 
separating Alzheimer's Disease patients versus normal controls (AD:NC) and 
medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5747) in separating stable versus progressive 
Mild Cognitively Impaired patients (sMCI:pMCI). Furthermore, the area under the 
ROC curve for a LDA classifier trained based on age, sex and HarP-derived 
hippocampal volume is 0.8858 for AD:NC, and for 0.6677 sMCI:pMCI. These results 
show that the harmonized protocol-derived labels can be widely used in clinic 
and research, as a sensitive and accurate way of delineating the hippocampus.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and exhibits a 
considerable level of heritability. Previous association studies gave evidence 
for the associations of HLA-DRB1/DQB1 alleles with AD. However, how and when the 
gene variants in HLA-DRB1/DQB1 function in AD pathogenesis has yet to be 
determined. Here, we firstly investigated the association of gene variants in 
HLA-DRB1/DQB1 alleles and AD related brain structure on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) in a large sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). We selected hippocampus, subregion, parahippocampus, 
posterior cingulate, precuneus, middle temporal, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala 
as regions of interest (ROIs). Twelve SNPs in HLA-DRB1/DQB1 were identified in 
the dataset following quality control measures. In the total group hybrid 
population analysis, our study (rs35445101, rs1130399, and rs28746809) were 
associated with the smaller baseline volume of the left posterior cingulate and 
rs2854275 was associated with the larger baseline volume of the left posterior 
cingulate. Furthermore, we detected the above four associations in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) sub-group analysis, and two risk loci (rs35445101 and 
rs1130399) were also the smaller baseline volume of the left posterior cingulate 
in (NC) sub-group analysis. Our study suggested that HLA-DRB1/DQB1 gene variants 
appeared to modulate the alteration of the left posterior cingulate volume, 
hence modulating the susceptibility of AD.

BACKGROUND: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism 
emerged as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little was known 
about its effects on the process of potential AD.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the Val66Met polymorphism on cognition, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neuroimaging markers in non-demented elderly 
individuals.
METHODS: A total of 1,081 adults without dementia (375 healthy subjects and 706 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment) were recruited from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the influence of BDNF Val66Met 
polymorphism on cognitive impairment, brain structure atrophy, and change in the 
levels of CSF biomarkers. Moreover, we also conducted our study in abnormal 
amyloid-β (A+) subgroup and normal amyloid-β (A-) subgroup, as well as in APOEɛ4 
carriers and non-carriers.
RESULTS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism had significant association with atrophy 
of the entorhinal cortex and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the 
non-demented elderly and A + subgroup, while no association was found in 
A-subgroup. What is more, there was a significant effect of interaction between 
BDNF Val66Met and amyloid-β load in MMSE. In addition, significant associations 
of BDNF Val66Met with the entorhinal cortex and ventricular volumes were found 
among APOEɛ4 non-carriers, but not APOEɛ4 carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with cognitive 
impairment and brain atrophy among the non-demented elderly, APOEɛ4 non-carriers 
and A + subgroup, implying the potential of the Val66Met polymorphism as an 
important genetic factor for AD-related neurodegeneration.

Recent interest in enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) in the brain, which can 
be visualized on MRI and appear isointense to cerebrospinal fluid on all 
sequence weightings, has resulted in the necessity of reliable algorithms for 
automated segmentation to allow for whole brain assessment of ePVS burden. 
However, several publicly available datasets do not contain sequences required 
for recently published algorithms. This prospective study presents a method for 
identification of enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) in white matter using 3T 
T1 and FLAIR MR imaging (MAPS-T1), making the algorithm accessible to groups 
with valuable sets of limited data. The approach was applied identically to two 
datasets: 1) a repeated measurement in a dementia-free aged human population 
(N = 14), and 2) an aged sample of multisite ADNI datasets (N = 30). ePVS 
segmentation was accomplished by a stepwise local homogeneity search of white 
matter-masked T1-weighted data, constrained by FLAIR hyperintensity, and further 
constrained by width, volume, and linearity measurements. Pearson's r was 
employed for statistical testing between visual (gold standard) assessment and 
repeated measures in cohort one. Visual ePVS counts were significantly 
correlated with MAPS-T1 (r = .72, P < .0001). Correlations between repeated 
measurements in cohort one were significant for both visual and automated 
methods in the single visually-rated slice (MAPS-T1: r = .87, P < .0001, visual: 
(r = .86, P < .0001) and for whole brain assessment (MAPS-T1: r = .77, 
P = .001). Results from each cohort were manually inspected and found to have 
positive predictive values of 77.5% and 87.5%, respectively. The approach 
described in this report is an important tool for detailed assessment of ePVS 
burden in white matter on routinely acquired MRI sequences.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by hippocampal atrophy. Other factors also 
influence the hippocampal volume, but their interactive effect has not been 
investigated before in cognitively healthy individuals. The aim of this study is 
to evaluate the interactive effect of key demographic and clinical factors on 
hippocampal volume, in contrast to previous studies frequently investigating 
these factors in a separate manner. Also, to investigate how comparable the 
control groups from ADNI, AIBL, and AddNeuroMed are with five population-based 
cohorts. In this study, 1958 participants were included (100 AddNeuroMed, 226 
ADNI, 155 AIBL, 59 BRC, 295 GENIC, 279 BioFiNDER, 398 PIVUS, and 446 SNAC-K). 
ANOVA and random forest were used for testing between-cohort differences in 
demographic-clinical variables. Multiple regression was used to study the 
influence of demographic-clinical variables on hippocampal volume. ANCOVA was 
used to analyze whether between-cohort differences in demographic-clinical 
variables explained between-cohort differences in hippocampal volume. Age and 
global brain atrophy were the most important variables in explaining variability 
in hippocampal volume. These variables were not only important themselves but 
also in interaction with gender, education, MMSE, and total intracranial volume. 
AddNeuroMed, ADNI, and AIBL differed from the population-based cohorts in 
several demographic-clinical variables that had a significant effect on 
hippocampal volume. Variability in hippocampal volume in individuals with normal 
cognition is high. Differences that previously tended to be related to disease 
mechanisms could also be partly explained by demographic and clinical factors 
independent from the disease. Furthermore, cognitively normal individuals 
especially from ADNI and AIBL are not representative of the general population. 
These findings may have important implications for future research and clinical 
trials, translating imaging biomarkers to the general population, and validating 
current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and predementia stages.

BACKGROUND: The percentage of verbal forgetting (VF%) measure of the Rey 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) has been proposed to differentiate 
patients diagnosed clinically with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB).
OBJECTIVE: To determine if VF% aligns with gold-standard biomarker and autopsy 
evidence of AD and DLB neuropathology.
METHODS: Clinical, cognitive, sociodemographic, and biomarker data were 
collected from 315 patients with baseline cognitive impairment and 485 normal 
controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). AD markers 
included reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β, elevated total-tau and 
phosphorylated-tau, hippocampal atrophy, and the presence of amyloid plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy. DLB markers included reduced CSF 
α-synuclein, preserved hippocampus, atrophied putamen, occipital glucose 
metabolism, and the presence of Lewy bodies at autopsy. Cognitively impaired 
participants were classified as ADVF% (n = 190) or DLBVF% (n = 125) based on 
their RAVLT VF% scores using a 75% cut-off (≥75%  = ADVF%, <75%  = DLBVF%). 
Postmortem data were available for 13 ADVF% participants, 13 DLBVF% patients, 
and six healthy controls.
RESULTS: ADVF% and DLBVF% participants did not differ on CSF or neuroimaging 
biomarkers, with the exception of total tau levels which were higher in ADVF%. 
In the subset of participants with autopsy data, comorbid AD and DLB pathology 
was most frequent in ADVF% participants, and pure DLB pathology was most 
frequent in DLBVF% participants, however, these differences were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The RAVLT VF% measure does not reliably align with AD and DLB 
neuropathology in ADNI participants.

The objective of this study was to develop new risk classifications for 
conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing the relative reliability of 
classifiers in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The 397 MCI 
subjects and all baseline data, including characteristics, neuropsychological 
tests, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and MRI findings in Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were used for analysis by Cox proportional 
hazard regression, bootstrap sampling, and c-index. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis revealed the following factors to be associated with increased risk of 
conversion from MCI to AD during the 53-month follow-up period: AVLT 30-minute 
delayed recall, AVLT trial 1, Boston naming, logical delayed recall, 
trail-making B, CDR-sob, ADAS13, the cortical thickness of the right inferior 
temporal lobe (st91ta), and the left hippocampus volume. The combinations of 
ADAS13 at a cutoff point of 15.67 with CDR-sob at 1.5 or with the cortical 
thickness of the right inferior temporal lobe at 2.56 mm3 produced high 
conversion rates of 92.7% (82.4%-100.0%) and 88.8% (77.3%-100.0%), respectively, 
at 48 months. The discriminative ability based on c-index for the proposed 
combination was 0.68. The sample size was estimated as 504 in the group with a 
combination of ADAS13 and CDR-sob whose conversion rate is highest. The 
combination of ADAS13 with CDR-sob at an optimal cutoff point has a high 
reliability in classifying the MCI patients into high- and low-risk conversion

Understanding the complex interplay between tau, amyloid and the network in the 
spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's Disease.

Raj A, Torok J, Ranasinghe K.

INTRODUCTION: The interaction of amyloid and tau in neurodegenerative diseases 
is a central feature of AD pathophysiology. While experimental studies point to 
various interaction mechanisms, their causal direction and mode (local, remote 
or network-mediated) remain unknown in human subjects. The aim of this study was 
to compare mathematical reaction-diffusion models encoding distinct 
cross-species couplings to identify which interactions were key to model 
success.
METHODS: We tested competing mathematical models of network spread, aggregation, 
and amyloid-tau interactions on publicly available data from ADNI.
RESULTS: Although network spread models captured the spatiotemporal evolution of 
tau and amyloid in human subjects, the model including a one-way amyloid-to-tau 
aggregation interaction performed best.
DISCUSSION: This mathematical exposition of the "pas de deux" of co-evolving 
proteins provides quantitative, whole-brain support to the concept of 
amyloid-facilitated-tauopathy rather than the classic amyloid-cascade or 
pure-tau hypotheses, and helps explain certain known but poorly understood 
aspects of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is 
phenotypically heterogeneous. APOE is a triallelic gene which correlates with 
phenotypic heterogeneity in AD. In this work, we determined the effect of APOE 
alleles on the disease progression timeline of AD using a discriminative 
event-based model (DEBM). Since DEBM is a data-driven model, stratification into 
smaller disease subgroups would lead to more inaccurate models as compared to 
fitting the model on the entire dataset. Hence our secondary aim is to propose 
and evaluate novel approaches in which we split the different steps of DEBM into 
group-aspecific and group-specific parts, where the entire dataset is used to 
train the group-aspecific parts and only the data from a specific group is used 
to train the group-specific parts of the DEBM. We performed simulation 
experiments to benchmark the accuracy of the proposed approaches and to select 
the optimal approach. Subsequently, the chosen approach was applied to the 
baseline data of 417 cognitively normal, 235 mild cognitively impaired who 
convert to AD within 3 years, and 342 AD patients from the Alzheimers Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to gain new insights into the effect of 
APOE carriership on the disease progression timeline of AD. In the ε4 carrier 
group, the model predicted with high confidence that CSF Amyloidβ42 and the 
cognitive score of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) are early 
biomarkers. Hippocampus was the earliest volumetric biomarker to become 
abnormal, closely followed by the CSF Phosphorylated Tau181 (PTAU) biomarker. In 
the homozygous ε3 carrier group, the model predicted a similar ordering among 
CSF biomarkers. However, the volume of the fusiform gyrus was identified as one 
of the earliest volumetric biomarker. While the findings in the ε4 carrier and 
the homozygous ε3 carrier groups fit the current understanding of progression of 
AD, the finding in the ε2 carrier group did not. The model predicted, with 
relatively low confidence, CSF Neurogranin as one of the earliest biomarkers 
along with cognitive score of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Amyloid β42 
was found to become abnormal after PTAU. The presented models could aid 
understanding of the disease, and in selecting homogeneous group of 
presymptomatic subjects at-risk of developing symptoms for clinical trials.

Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Network for Joint Atrophy Localization and 
Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using Structural MRI.

Lian C, Liu M, Zhang J, Shen D.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been widely used for 
computer-aided diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), due to its sensitivity to morphological changes caused by brain 
atrophy. Recently, a few deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural 
networks, CNNs) have been proposed to learn task-oriented features from sMRI for 
AD diagnosis, and achieved superior performance than the conventional 
learning-based methods using hand-crafted features. However, these existing 
CNN-based methods still require the pre-determination of informative locations 
in sMRI. That is, the stage of discriminative atrophy localization is isolated 
to the latter stages of feature extraction and classifier construction. In this 
paper, we propose a hierarchical fully convolutional network (H-FCN) to 
automatically identify discriminative local patches and regions in the whole 
brain sMRI, upon which multi-scale feature representations are then jointly 
learned and fused to construct hierarchical classification models for AD 
diagnosis. Our proposed H-FCN method was evaluated on a large cohort of subjects 
from two independent datasets (i.e., ADNI-1 and ADNI-2), demonstrating good 
performance on joint discriminative atrophy localization and brain disease 
diagnosis.

The strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 
Apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (ApoE ε4). The interaction between sex and ApoE 
ε4 carrier status on AD risk remains an area of intense investigation. We 
hypothesized that sex modulates the relationship between ApoE ε4 carrier status 
and brain tau deposition (a quantitative endophenotype in AD) in individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Preprocessed 18F-AV-1451 tau and 
18F-AV-45 amyloid PET images, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans, demographic information, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau 
(t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements from 108 MCI subjects in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were included. After 
downloading pre-processed images from ADNI, an iterative reblurred Van 
Cittertiteration partial volume correction (PVC) method was applied to all PET 
images. MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) 
were defined in standard space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) 
images relative to cerebellum were computed. ApoE ε4 by sex interaction analyses 
on 18F-AV-1451 and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) were assessed using generalized linear 
models. The association between 18F-AV-1451 SUVR and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) was 
assessed. Results: After applying PVC and controlling for age, education level 
and global cortical 18F-AV-45 SUVR, we found that the entorhinal cortex, 
amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and occipital ROIs 
exhibited a significant ApoE ε4 by sex interaction effect (false discovery rate 
P < 0.1) among MCI individuals. We also found a significant ApoE ε4 by sex 
interaction effect on CSF t-tau and p-tau. 18F-AV-1451 SUVR in the 5 ROIs with 
ApoE ε4 by sex interaction was significantly correlated with CSF p-tau and 
t-tau. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that women are more susceptible to ApoE 
ε4-associated accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in MCI compared to males. 
Both CSF tau (p-tau, t-tau) and brain tau PET are robust quantitative biomarkers 
for studying ApoE ε4 by sex effects on brain tau deposition in MCI participants.

In recent studies, neuroanatomical volume and shape asymmetries have been seen 
during the course of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and could potentially be used as 
preclinical imaging biomarkers for the prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) and AD dementia. In this study, a deep learning framework utilizing 
Siamese neural networks trained on paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is 
used to harness the discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. 
The method uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric 
features of pre-defined atlas brain structures, and a novel non-linear kernel 
trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across datasets and 
populations. By working with the low-dimensional features, Siamese networks were 
shown to yield comparable performance to studies that utilize whole-brain MR 
images, with the advantage of reduced complexity and computational time, while 
preserving the biological information density. Experimental results also show 
that Siamese networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding 
the asymmetry in brain volumes, compared to traditional prediction methods that 
do not use the asymmetry, on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are among the most disabling 
and difficult aspects for caregivers and treating health professionals to 
manage. Despite the high prevalence of these behaviors, little is known about 
the factors which lead some patients to develop florid behavioral symptoms while 
others may progress to severe dementia without such phenomenon. We examined 
whether regional brain volumes as measured by cortical thickness would predict 
the presence or absence of disinhibition in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
Using data from the ADNI, we identified 758 patients with caregiver ratings on 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and a volumetric MRI scan with cortical thickness 
measurements completed in FreeSurfer by the UCSF core. Of these, 177 patients 
were found to have disinhibition. Logistic regression models demonstrated that 
reduced cortical thickness in the right frontal pole was associated with the 
presence of disinhibition even when controlling for age, disease severity, total 
intracranial volume, gender, and APOE genotype. The results are considered in 
the context of leading models of the functions of frontopolar cortex.

High-order Feature Learning for Multi-atlas based Label Fusion: Application to 
Brain Segmentation with MRI.

Sun L, Shao W, Wang M, Zhang D, Liu M.

Multi-atlas based segmentation methods have shown their effectiveness in brain 
regions-of-interesting (ROIs) segmentation, by propagating labels from multiple 
atlases to a target image based on the similarity between patches in the target 
image and multiple atlas images. Most of the existing multiatlas based methods 
use image intensity features to calculate the similarity between a pair of image 
patches for label fusion. In particular, using only low-level image intensity 
features cannot adequately characterize the complex appearance patterns (e.g., 
the high-order relationship between voxels within a patch) of brain magnetic 
resonance (MR) images. To address this issue, this paper develops a high-order 
feature learning framework for multi-atlas based label fusion, where high-order 
features of image patches are extracted and fused for segmenting ROIs of 
structural brain MR images. Specifically, an unsupervised feature learning 
method (i.e., means-covariances restricted Boltzmann machine, mcRBM) is employed 
to learn high-order features (i.e., mean and covariance features) of patches in 
brain MR images. Then, a group-fused sparsity dictionary learning method is 
proposed to jointly calculate the voting weights for label fusion, based on the 
learned high-order and the original image intensity features. The proposed 
method is compared with several state-of-the-art label fusion methods on ADNI, 
NIREP and LONI-LPBA40 datasets. The Dice ratio achieved by our method is 88:30%, 
88:83%, 79:54% and 81:02% on left and right hippocampus on the ADNI, NIREP and 
LONI-LPBA40 datasets, respectively, while the best Dice ratio yielded by the 
other methods are 86:51%, 87:39%, 78:48% and 79:65% on three datasets, 
respectively.

In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(rs-fMRI) scans from subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and 
control subjects to study functional network connectivity. The scans were 
acquired by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used 
genetic data from the ADNI database to further subdivide the EMCI and control 
groups into genotype groups with or without the Apolipoprotein E allele e4 (APOE 
e4). Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI resting-state functional connectivity was 
measured using Freesurfer and the Functional Connectivity Toolbox for Matlab 
(CONN). In our analysis, we compared whole-brain ROI connectivity strength and 
ROI-to-ROI functional network connectivity strength between EMCI, control and 
genotype subject groups. We found that the ROI network properties were disrupted 
in EMCI and APOE e4 carrier groups. Notably, we show that (1) EMCI disrupts 
functional connectivity strength in many important functionally-linked areas; 
(2) APOE e4 disrupts functional connectivity strength in similar areas to EMCI; 
and (3) the differences in functional connectivity between groups shows a 
multifactor contribution to functional network dysfunction along the trajectory 
leading to dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease 
highly correlated to aging. Whether AD originates by targeting a localized brain 
area and propagates to the rest of the brain across disease-severity progression 
is a question with an unknown answer. Here, we aim to provide an answer to this 
question at the group-level by looking at differences in diffusion-tensor brain 
networks. In particular, making use of data from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), four different groups were defined (all of them 
matched by age, sex and education level): G1 (N1 = 36, healthy control subjects, 
Control), G2 (N2 = 36, early mild cognitive impairment, EMCI), G3 (N3 = 36, late 
mild cognitive impairment, LMCI) and G4 (N4 = 36, AD). Diffusion-tensor brain 
networks were compared across three disease stages: stage I (Control vs. EMCI), 
stage II (Control vs. LMCI) and stage III (Control vs. AD). The group comparison 
was performed using the multivariate distance matrix regression analysis, a 
technique that was born in genomics and was recently proposed to handle brain 
functional networks, but here applied to diffusion-tensor data. The results were 
threefold: First, no significant differences were found in stage I. Second, 
significant differences were found in stage II in the connectivity pattern of a 
subnetwork strongly associated to memory function (including part of the 
hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle 
temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole). Third, a widespread 
disconnection across the entire AD brain was found in stage III, affecting more 
strongly the same memory subnetwork appearing in stage II, plus the other new 
subnetworks, including the default mode network, medial visual network, 
frontoparietal regions and striatum. Our results are consistent with a scenario 
where progressive alterations of connectivity arise as the disease severity 
increases and provide the brain areas possibly involved in such a degenerative 
process. Further studies applying the same strategy to longitudinal data are 
needed to fully confirm this scenario.

A subgroup of overweight/obese individuals, who had favorable metabolic 
profiles, was termed as metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHO). Several 
studies suggested that MHO individuals were not at increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease and all-course mortality. However, whether MHO is 
associated with excess risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elders remains 
unclear. To explore the risk of AD among MHO phenotype and investigate whether 
MHO associates with neurodegenerative biomarkers of AD, we assessed body mass 
index-metabolic status phenotypes of 1199 longitudinal elders from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using the Adult 
Treatment Panel-III (ATP- III) criteria. MHO subjects were at a significantly 
decreased risk for AD (adjusted HR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97) compared with 
metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) subjects. In multivariable linear 
regression models, the cross-sectional associations of MHO with cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain Aβ load, and cortical structure were explored. MHO 
was positively correlated with CSF-Aβ (β=0.746, P=0.015), hippocampal volume 
(β=0.181, P=0.011), and whole brain volume (β=0.133, P=0.004). The MHO phenotype 
of the elder conferred a decreased risk of AD and its role may be driven by Aβ.

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to robustly and accurately 
detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the distinction of specific atrophic 
patterns of anatomical structures such as hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex 
(EC). The proposed method simultaneously performs segmentation and grading of 
structures to efficiently capture the anatomical alterations caused by AD. Known 
as SNIPE (Scoring by Non-local Image Patch Estimator), the novel proposed 
grading measure is based on a nonlocal patch-based frame-work and estimates the 
similarity of the patch surrounding the voxel under study with all the patches 
present in different training populations. In this study, the training library 
was composed of two populations: 50 cognitively normal subjects (CN) and 50 
patients with AD, randomly selected from the ADNI database. During our 
experiments, the classification accuracy of patients (CN vs. AD) using several 
biomarkers was compared: HC and EC volumes, the grade of these structures and 
finally the combination of their volume and their grade. Tests were completed in 
a leave-one-out framework using discriminant analysis. First, we showed that 
biomarkers based on HC provide better classification accuracy than biomarkers 
based on EC. Second, we demonstrated that structure grading is a more powerful 
measure than structure volume to distinguish both populations with a 
classification accuracy of 90%. Finally, by adding the ages of subjects in order 
to better separate age-related structural changes from disease-related 
anatomical alterations, SNIPE obtained a classification accuracy of 93%.

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in 
cognitively normal (CN) seniors on regional metabolism of specific brain regions 
known to be affected by p-tau deposition.
METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), volumetric 
magnetic resonance imaging scans, and global amyloid standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVr) were obtained for 210 CNs from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI2). Region of interest (ROI) extraction was used 
to obtain functional SUVr from six bilateral ROIs: amygdala (AM), entorhinal 
cortex (EC), hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal, posterior cingulate (PC), and 
middle temporal gyrus. Every metabolic SUVr set was averaged and analyzed 
against the corresponding subject's amyloid SUVr. Correlation analyses were 
conducted on the full group and between APOE ε4-positive and APOE ε4-negative 
subgroups.
RESULTS: The APOE ε4+ group exhibited significantly higher metabolism in the EC 
(r = 0.270, P = .038) and AM (r = 0.267, P = .041). When a significance of the 
difference test was conducted between the APOE ε4+ and APOE ε4-groups, these 
same regions remained significant: P = .012 and P = .016, respectively. By 
contrast, the APOE ε4 group displayed only the conventionally expected result of 
reduced regional metabolism in the PC (r = -0.161, P = .048), with higher Aβ 
load.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of amyloid positivity on brain metabolism is regionally 
specific, and APOE ε4 status substantially modulates regional glucose uptake in 
these regions. The APOE ε4 allele may cause earlier emergence of clinical 
symptoms in AD via a mechanism that influences regional metabolic demand in 
specifically those regions where p-tau deposition is known to occur earliest.

Alzheimer's Disease Computer-Aided Diagnosis: Histogram-Based Analysis of 
Regional MRI Volumes for Feature Selection and Classification.

Ruiz E, Ramírez J, Górriz JM, Casillas J; Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative.

This paper proposes a novel fully automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) 
system for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on supervised 
machine learning methods. The novelty of the approach, which is based on 
histogram analysis, is twofold: 1) a feature extraction process that aims to 
detect differences in brain regions of interest (ROIs) relevant for the 
recognition of subjects with AD and 2) an original greedy algorithm that 
predicts the severity of the effects of AD on these regions. This algorithm 
takes account of the progressive nature of AD that affects the brain structure 
with different levels of severity, i.e., the loss of gray matter in AD is found 
first in memory-related areas of the brain such as the hippocampus. Moreover, 
the proposed feature extraction process generates a reduced set of attributes 
which allows the use of general-purpose classification machine learning 
algorithms. In particular, the proposed feature extraction approach assesses the 
ROI image separability between classes in order to identify the ones with 
greater discriminant power. These regions will have the highest influence in the 
classification decision at the final stage. Several experiments were carried out 
on segmented magnetic resonance images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) in order to show the benefits of the overall method. The 
proposed CAD system achieved competitive classification results in a highly 
efficient and straightforward way.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that 
primarily affects the hippocampus. Since hippocampal studies have highlighted a 
differential subregional regulation along its longitudinal axis, a more detailed 
analysis addressing subregional changes along the longitudinal hippocampal axis 
has the potential to provide new relevant biomarkers. This study included 
structural brain MRI data of 583 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cognitively normal (CN) subjects, mild 
cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects and AD patients were conveniently selected 
considering the age and sex match between clinical groups. Structural MRI 
acquisitions were pre-processed and analysed with a new longitudinal axis 
segmentation method, dividing the hippocampus in three subdivisions (anterior, 
intermediate, and posterior). When normalizing the volume of hippocampal 
sub-divisions to total hippocampus, the posterior hippocampus negatively 
correlates with age only in CN subjects (r = -.31). The longitudinal ratio of 
hippocampal atrophy (anterior sub-division divided by the posterior one) shows a 
significant increase with age only in CN (r = .25). Overall, in AD, the 
posterior hippocampus is predominantly atrophied early on. Consequently, the 
anterior/posterior hippocampal ratio is an AD differentiating metric at early 
disease stages with potential for diagnostic and prognostic applications.

PURPOSE: To examine associations between the APOE-ε2 and APOE-ε4 alleles and 
core Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological hallmarks as measured by amyloid-β 
(Aβ) and tau PET in older individuals without dementia.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 462 ADNI participants without dementia who 
underwent Aβ ([18F]florbetapir or [18F]florbetaben) and tau ([18F]flortaucipir) 
PET, structural MRI, and cognitive testing. Employing APOE-ε3 homozygotes as the 
reference group, associations between APOE-ε2 and APOE-ε4 carriership with 
global Aβ PET and regional tau PET measures (entorhinal cortex (ERC), inferior 
temporal cortex, and Braak-V/VI neocortical composite regions) were investigated 
using linear regression models. In a subset of 156 participants, we also 
investigated associations between APOE genotype and regional tau accumulation 
over time using linear mixed models. Finally, we assessed whether Aβ mediated 
the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between APOE genotype and tau.
RESULTS: Compared to APOE-ε3 homozygotes, APOE-ε2 carriers had lower global Aβ 
burden (βstd [95% confidence interval (CI)]: - 0.31 [- 0.45, - 0.16], p = 0.034) 
but did not differ on regional tau burden or tau accumulation over time. APOE-ε4 
participants showed higher Aβ (βstd [95%CI]: 0.64 [0.42, 0.82], p < 0.001) and 
tau burden (βstd range: 0.27-0.51, all p < 0.006). In mediation analyses, 
APOE-ε4 only retained an Aβ-independent effect on tau in the ERC. APOE-ε4 showed 
a trend towards increased tau accumulation over time in Braak-V/VI compared to 
APOE-ε3 homozygotes (βstd [95%CI]: 0.10 [- 0.02, 0.18], p = 0.11), and this 
association was fully mediated by baseline Aβ.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the established protective effect of the 
APOE-ε2 allele against developing clinical AD is primarily linked to resistance 
against Aβ deposition rather than tau pathology.

BACKGROUND: Whether the presence of the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele modulates 
hippocampal connectivity networks in abnormal ageing has yet to be fully 
clarified.
OBJECTIVE: Allele-dependent differences in this pattern of functional 
connectivity were investigated in patients with very mild neurodegeneration of 
the Alzheimer's type, carriers and non-carriers of the ε4 allele.
METHOD: A seed-based connectivity approach was used. The two groups were similar 
in demographics, volumetric measures of brain structure, and cognitive profiles.
RESULTS: ε4-carriers had increased connectivity between the seed area in the 
left hippocampus and 1) a left insular/lateral prefrontal region and 2) the 
contralateral right parietal cortex. Moreover, hippocampus- to-parietal 
connectivity in the group of ε4 carriers was positively associated with memory 
performance, indicating that the between-group difference reflects compensatory 
processes. Retrospective analyses of functional connectivity based on patients 
from the ADNI initiative confirmed this pattern.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that increased connectivity with areas external to the 
Default Mode Network (DMN) reflects both compensatory recruitment of additional 
areas, and pathological interwining between the DMN and the salience network as 
part of a global ε4-dependent circuital disruption. These differences indicate 
that the ε4 allele is associated with a more profound degree of DMN network 
breakdown even in the prodromal stage of neurodegeneration.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether depression and apathy are independently 
associated with longitudinal trajectories of cortical atrophy in the entorhinal 
cortex compared with frontal subregions previously implicated in late-life mood 
disturbance.
METHODS: Data from 334 participants classified as having mild cognitive 
impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were 
analyzed by using multilevel models for change adjusted for age, global 
cognitive status, and total intracranial volume at enrollment. Participants in 
ADNI were recruited from >50 clinical research sites in the United States and 
Canada. Depression and apathy were identified by informants using the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was 
performed on 1.5-Tesla scanners according to the standardized ADNI-1 protocol on 
an average of 5 occasions over an average of 30.5 months. Regional cortical 
thickness values were derived from longitudinal data processing in FreeSurfer 
version 4.4.
RESULTS: Depression was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the 
entorhinal cortex at baseline and accelerated atrophy in the anterior cingulate 
cortex. Similar relationships between depression and the orbitofrontal cortex 
and between apathy and the anterior cingulate cortex were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In mild cognitive impairment, depression signs are a better marker 
of longitudinal cortical atrophy than apathy. Results are consistent with 
hypotheses that depression is an early sign of a more aggressive 
neurodegenerative process or that depression lowers brain reserve capacity, 
allowing for more rapid progression of Alzheimer disease neuropathology.

INTRODUCTION: We previously proposed a novel taxonomic framework to describe the 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) profiles of white matter tracts by their 
diffusivity and neural properties. We have shown the relevance of this strategy 
toward interpreting brain tissue signatures in Classic Normal Pressure 
Hydrocephalus vs. comparator cohorts of mild traumatic brain injury and 
Alzheimer's disease. In this iteration of the Periodic Table of DTI Elements, we 
examined patterns of tissue distortion in Complex NPH (CoNPH) and validated the 
methodology against an open-access dataset of healthy subjects, to expand its 
accessibility to a larger community.
METHODS: DTI measures for 12 patients with CoNPH with multiple comorbidities and 
45 cognitively normal controls from the ADNI database were derived using the 
image processing pipeline on the brainlife.io open cloud computing platform. 
Using the Periodic Table algorithm, DTI profiles for CoNPH vs. controls were 
mapped according to injury patterns.
RESULTS: Structural volumes in most structures tested were significantly lower 
and the lateral ventricles higher in CoNPH vs. controls. In CoNPH, significantly 
lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean, axial, and radial 
diffusivities (MD, L1, and L2 and 3, respectively) were observed in white matter 
related to the lateral ventricles. Most diffusivity measures across 
supratentorial and infratentorial structures were significantly higher in CoNPH, 
with the largest differences in the cerebellum cortex. In subcortical deep gray 
matter structures, CoNPH and controls differed most significantly in the 
hippocampus, with the CoNPH group having a significantly lower FA and higher MD, 
L1, and L2 and 3. Cerebral and cerebellar white matter demonstrated more 
potential reversibility of injury compared to cerebral and cerebellar cortices.
DISCUSSION: The findings of widespread and significant reductions in subcortical 
deep gray matter structures, in comparison to healthy controls, support the 
hypothesis that Complex NPH cohorts retain imaging features associated with 
Classic NPH. The use of the algorithm of the Periodic Table allowed for greater 
consistency in the interpretation of DTI results by focusing on patterns of 
injury rather than an over-reliance on the interrogation of individual measures 
by statistical significance alone. Our aim is to provide a prototype that could 
be refined for an approach toward the concept of a "translational taxonomy."

Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is 
intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor 
their effectiveness, as well as to lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. 
Magnetic Resonance (MR)-related biomarkers have been recently identified by the 
use of machine learning methods for the in vivo differential diagnosis of AD. 
However, the vast majority of neuroimaging papers investigating this topic are 
focused on the difference between AD and patients with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), not considering the impact of MCI patients who will (MCIc) or not convert 
(MCInc) to AD. Morphological T1-weighted MRIs of 137 AD, 76 MCIc, 134 MCInc, and 
162 healthy controls (CN) selected from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging 
initiative (ADNI) cohort, were used by an optimized machine learning algorithm. 
Voxels influencing the classification between these AD-related pre-clinical 
phases involved hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, basal ganglia, gyrus rectus, 
precuneus, and cerebellum, all critical regions known to be strongly involved in 
the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. Classification accuracy was 76% AD vs. 
CN, 72% MCIc vs. CN, 66% MCIc vs. MCInc (nested 20-fold cross validation). Our 
data encourage the application of computer-based diagnosis in clinical practice 
of AD opening new prospective in the early management of AD patients.

Computer-aided prediction of dementia status (e.g., clinical scores of cognitive 
tests) from brain MRI is of great clinical value, as it can help assess 
pathological stage and predict disease progression. Existing learning-based 
approaches typically preselect dementia-sensitive regions from the whole-brain 
MRI for feature extraction and prediction model construction, which might be 
sub-optimal due to potential heterogeneities between different steps. Also, 
based on anatomical prior knowledge (e.g., brain atlas) and time-consuming 
nonlinear registration, these preselected brain regions are usually the same 
across all subjects, ignoring their individual specificities in dementia 
progression. In this paper, we propose a multi-task weakly-supervised attention 
network (MWAN) to jointly predict multiple clinical scores from the baseline MRI 
data, by explicitly considering individual specificities of different subjects. 
Leveraging a fully-trainable dementia attention block, our MWAN method can 
automatically identify subject-specific discriminative locations from the 
whole-brain MRI for end-to-end feature learning and multi-task regression. We 
evaluated our MWAN method by cross-validation on two public datasets (i.e., 
ADNI-1 and ADNI-2). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method 
performs well in both the tasks of clinical score prediction and 
weakly-supervised discriminative localization in brain MR images.

Neuroimaging provides a powerful tool to characterize neurodegenerative 
progression and therapeutic efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its 
prodromal stage-mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, since the disease 
pathology might cause different patterns of structural degeneration, which is 
not pre-known, it is still a challenging problem to identify the relevant 
imaging markers for facilitating disease interpretation and classification. 
Recently, sparse learning methods have been investigated in neuroimaging studies 
for selecting the relevant imaging biomarkers and have achieved very promising 
results on disease classification. However, in the standard sparse learning 
method, the spatial structure is often ignored, although it is important for 
identifying the informative biomarkers. In this paper, a sparse learning method 
with tree-structured regularization is proposed to capture patterns of 
pathological degeneration from fine to coarse scale, for helping identify the 
informative imaging biomarkers to guide the disease classification and 
interpretation. Specifically, we first develop a new tree construction method 
based on the hierarchical agglomerative clustering of voxel-wise imaging 
features in the whole brain, by taking into account their spatial adjacency, 
feature similarity and discriminability. In this way, the complexity of all 
possible multi-scale spatial configurations of imaging features can be reduced 
to a single tree of nested regions. Second, we impose the tree-structured 
regularization on the sparse learning to capture the imaging structures, and 
then use them for selecting the most relevant biomarkers. Finally, we train a 
support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the selected features to make the 
classification. We have evaluated our proposed method by using the baseline MR 
images of 830 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, which includes 198 AD patients, 167 progressive MCI (pMCI), 236 
stable MCI (sMCI), and 229 normal controls (NC). Our experimental results show 
that our method can achieve accuracies of 90.2 %, 87.2 %, and 70.7 % for 
classifications of AD vs. NC, pMCI vs. NC, and pMCI vs. sMCI, respectively, 
demonstrating promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art 
methods.

Biomarkers are the only feasible way to detect and monitor presymptomatic 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). No single biomarker can predict future cognitive 
decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful 
multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of 
disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here 
we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for 
differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD 
subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 
95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. 
We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of 
hippocampal volume and CSF Aβ, t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in 
combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. 
We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model 
would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three 
diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy 
and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed 
better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC 
from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. 
AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not 
for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination 
of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion 
performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex 
achieved AUC = 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while 
CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUC = 0.89 for predicting conversion in 
ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory 
in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the 
disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the 
disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible 
for some of the observed disease heterogeneity.

Imaging traits provide a powerful and biologically relevant substrate to examine 
the influence of genetics on the brain. Interest in genome-wide, brain-wide 
search for influential genetic variants is growing, but has mainly focused on 
univariate, SNP-based association tests. Moving to gene-based multivariate 
statistics, we can test the combined effect of multiple genetic variants in a 
single test statistic. Multivariate models can reduce the number of statistical 
tests in gene-wide or genome-wide scans and may discover gene effects 
undetectable with SNP-based methods. Here we present a gene-based method for 
associating the joint effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18,044 
genes across 31,662 voxels of the whole brain in 731 elderly subjects (mean age: 
75.56±6.82SD years; 430 males) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Structural MRI scans were analyzed using tensor-based 
morphometry (TBM) to compute 3D maps of regional brain volume differences 
compared to an average template image based on healthy elderly subjects. Using 
the voxel-level volume difference values as the phenotype, we selected the most 
significantly associated gene (out of 18,044) at each voxel across the brain. No 
genes identified were significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but 
several known candidates were re-identified, as were other genes highly relevant 
to brain function. GAB2, which has been previously associated with late-onset 
AD, was identified as the top gene in this study, suggesting the validity of the 
approach. This multivariate, gene-based voxelwise association study offers a 
novel framework to detect genetic influences on the brain.

Membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 6A (MS4A6A) has been identified 
as susceptibility loci of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by several recent genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS), whereas little is known about the potential roles of 
these variants in the brain structure and function of AD. In this study, we 
included a total of 812 individuals from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. Using multiple linear regression models, we found 
MS4A6A genotypes were strongly related to atrophy rate of left middle temporal 
(rs610932: Pc = 0.017, rs7232: Pc = 0.022), precuneus (rs610932: Pc = 0.015) and 
entorhinal (rs610932, Pc = 0.022) on MRI in the entire group. In the subgroup 
analysis, MS4A6A SNPs were significantly accelerated the percentage of volume 
loss of middle temporal, precuneus and entorhinal, especially in the MCI 
subgroup. These findings reveal that MS4A6A genotypes affect AD specific brain 
structures which supported the possible role of MS4A6A polymorphisms in 
influencing AD-related neuroimaging phenotypes.

Elevated cortisol as a measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis 
hyperactivity has emerged as a predictor of clinical progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), in conjunction with amyloid-β (Aβ) abnormalities. Yet factors 
exist which have the propensity to delay AD symptomatic expression in the face 
of an AD-type biomarker-based pathological profile. This study sought to 
determine whether abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ and elevated cortisol 
levels are associated with clinical transition to mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and AD in cognitively normal (CN) individuals, and if this association is 
modified by reserve proxies. Data from 91 CN individuals participating in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with available morning CSF 
cortisol and Aβ42 were evaluated. Reserve was modelled as a latent composite 
score of standardized intracranial volume and lifetime experience proxies. Cox 
regressions were used to test associations between baseline CSF cortisol/Aβ42, 
reserve score and AD progression; adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E 
genotype, and depressive symptoms. Individuals with elevated cortisol + abnormal 
Aβ42 levels at baseline showed highest risk of clinical progression. After a 
median of 84 months follow-up, significant cortisol/Aβ/ reserve interaction for 
clinical progression was noted (adjusted HR = 0.15, p < 0.001), suggesting a 
moderating effect of reserve on the association between cortisol/Aβ+ and 
clinical progression. Our findings indicate that cortisol hypersecretion 
accelerates clinical progression in CN individuals presenting with pathological 
Aβ42. High reserve reduces the associated AD progression risk in these high-risk 
individuals.

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid plaques are hallmark neuropathological 
features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is some debate as to which 
neuropathological feature comes first in the disease process, with early autopsy 
studies suggesting that NFT develop first, and more recent neuroimaging studies 
supporting the early role of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers of Aβ₄₂ and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been shown to 
serve as in vivo proxy measures of amyloid plaques and NFT, respectively. The 
aim of this study was to examine the association between CSF biomarkers and rate 
of atrophy in the precuneus and hippocampus. These regions were selected because 
the precuneus appears to be affected early and severely by Aβ deposition, and 
the hippocampus similarly by NFT pathology. We predicted (1) baseline Aβ₄₂ would 
be related to accelerated rate of cortical thinning in the precuneus and volume 
loss in the hippocampus, with the latter relationship expected to be weaker, (2) 
baseline p-tau(181p) would be related to accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy 
and cortical thinning in the precuneus, with the latter relationship expected to 
be weaker. Using all ADNI cohorts, we fitted separate linear mixed-effects 
models for changes in hippocampus and precuneus longitudinal outcome measures 
with baseline CSF biomarkers modeled as predictors. Results partially supported 
our hypotheses: Both baseline p-tau(181p) and Aβ₄₂ were associated with 
hippocampal atrophy over time. Neither p-tau(181p) nor Aβ₄₂ were significantly 
related to cortical thinning in the precuneus over time. However, follow-up 
analyses demonstrated that having abnormal levels of both Aβ₄₂ and p-tau(181p) 
was associated with an accelerated rate of atrophy in both the hippocampus and 
precuneus. Results support early effects of Aβ in the Alzheimer's disease 
process, which are less apparent than and perhaps dependent on p-tau effects as 
the disease progresses. However, amyloid deposition alone may be insufficient 
for emergence of significant morphometric changes and clinical symptoms.

This paper presents a novel, publicly available repository of anatomically 
segmented brain images of healthy subjects as well as patients with mild 
cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The underlying magnetic resonance 
images have been obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. T1-weighted screening and baseline images (1.5T and 3T) have 
been processed with the multi-atlas based MAPER procedure, resulting in labels 
for 83 regions covering the whole brain in 816 subjects. Selected segmentations 
were subjected to visual assessment. The segmentations are self-consistent, as 
evidenced by strong agreement between segmentations of paired images acquired at 
different field strengths (Jaccard coefficient: 0.802±0.0146). Morphometric 
comparisons between diagnostic groups (normal; stable mild cognitive impairment; 
mild cognitive impairment with progression to Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer's 
disease) showed highly significant group differences for individual regions, the 
majority of which were located in the temporal lobe. Additionally, significant 
effects were seen in the parietal lobe. Increased left/right asymmetry was found 
in posterior cortical regions. An automatically derived white-matter 
hypointensities index was found to be a suitable means of quantifying 
white-matter disease. This repository of segmentations is a potentially valuable 
resource to researchers working with ADNI data.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) 
regulates blood glucose levels, facilitates hippocampal synaptic plasticity and 
may have a predictive value for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.
METHODS: IGFBP-2 levels were studied in plasma in 566 subjects and in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 245 subjects across the AD spectrum from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Variants in the IGFBP-2 gene 
were examined. Linear mixed modeling in SPSS tested main effects of IGFBP-2 and 
interactions with APOE4 on neurocognitive indices and biomarkers. Voxel-wise 
regression was used to gauge IGFBP-2 and regional grey matter and glucose 
metabolism associations.
RESULTS: Each point increase in IGFBP-2 corresponded to a three times greater 
likelihood of having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. IGFBP-2 showed 
beneficial associations with respect to cognitive scores in individuals with two 
APOE4 alleles. Higher IGFBP-2 predicted higher insulin resistance, but not CSF 
amyloid or tau. Voxel-wise analyses showed that plasma IGFBP-2 predicted lower 
grey matter volume and FDG metabolism in a large area spanning the frontal, 
temporal, and occipital lobes. CSF IGFBP-2 levels showed similar voxel-wise 
analysis results, but were uniquely associated with CSF amyloid and tau. 
Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGFBP-2 showed that 
subjects carrying risk alleles versus common alleles had increased risk of AD 
and lower memory scores. Voxel-wise analyses of these SNPs also implicated the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: IGFBP-2 is associated with AD risk and outcomes; plasma IGFBP-2 
provides stronger predictive power for brain outcomes, while CSF IGFBP-2 
provides improved predictive accuracy for AD CSF biomarkers.

OBJECTIVE: Intraindividual cognitive variability (IIV), a measure of 
within-person variability across cognitive measures at a single time point, is 
associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Little is known regarding brain changes underlying IIV, or the relationship 
between IIV and functional ability. Therefore, we investigated the association 
between IIV and cerebral atrophy in AD-vulnerable regions and everyday 
functioning in nondemented older adults.
METHOD: 736 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (285 
cognitively normal [CN]; 451 MCI) underwent neuropsychological testing and 
serial MRI over 2 years. Linear mixed effects models examined the association 
between baseline IIV and change in entorhinal cortex thickness, hippocampal 
volume, and everyday functioning.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, amyloid-β 
positivity, and mean level of cognitive performance, higher baseline IIV 
predicted faster rates of entorhinal and hippocampal atrophy, as well as 
functional decline. Higher IIV was associated with both entorhinal and 
hippocampal atrophy among MCI participants but selective vulnerability of the 
entorhinal cortex among CN individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: IIV was associated with more widespread medial temporal lobe (MTL) 
atrophy in individuals with MCI relative to CN, suggesting that IIV may be 
tracking advancing MTL pathologic changes across the continuum of aging, MCI, 
and dementia. Findings suggest that cognitive dispersion may be a sensitive 
marker of neurodegeneration and functional decline in nondemented older adults.

We propose a novel framework for the automatic propagation of a set of manually 
labeled brain atlases to a diverse set of images of a population of subjects. A 
manifold is learned from a coordinate system embedding that allows the 
identification of neighborhoods which contain images that are similar based on a 
chosen criterion. Within the new coordinate system, the initial set of atlases 
is propagated to all images through a succession of multi-atlas segmentation 
steps. This breaks the problem of registering images that are very "dissimilar" 
down into a problem of registering a series of images that are "similar". At the 
same time, it allows the potentially large deformation between the images to be 
modeled as a sequence of several smaller deformations. We applied the proposed 
method to an exemplar region centered around the hippocampus from a set of 30 
atlases based on images from young healthy subjects and a dataset of 796 images 
from elderly dementia patients and age-matched controls enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We demonstrate an increasing 
gain in accuracy of the new method, compared to standard multi-atlas 
segmentation, with increasing distance between the target image and the initial 
set of atlases in the coordinate embedding, i.e., with a greater difference 
between atlas and image. For the segmentation of the hippocampus on 182 images 
for which a manual segmentation is available, we achieved an average overlap 
(Dice coefficient) of 0.85 with the manual reference.

The aging of the brain is a well-investigated topic, but existing analyses have 
mainly focused on Caucasian samples. To investigate brain aging in East Asians, 
we measured cortical and subcortical volumes from magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans of 1,008 cognitively normal elderly Koreans from the Gwangju 
Alzheimer's and Related Dementia cohort and 342 Caucasians from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. To determine whether the aging 
effect varies with ethnicity and sex, beta coefficients of age and confidence 
intervals (CIs) were estimated in each ethnicity-sex group using a bootstrap 
method and a regression analysis using the relative volume to intracranial 
volume as predicted. The betas or aging slopes largely were not significantly 
different between ethnicity and sex groups in most types of brain structures. 
However, ethnic differences between the two female groups were found in the 
brain, most cortical regions, and a few subcortical regions. Ethnic differences 
in brain aging are likely due in large part to genetic factors; thus, we 
compared carriers and non-carriers of a gene relevant to longevity and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4. The regions with 
ethnic differences in women also showed significant differences between Korean 
APOE ε4 non-carriers and Caucasian APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, Caucasian 
women showed significant APOE ε4 effects in the largest number of regions. These 
results illustrate that much of the ethnic differences in females may be 
explained by synergistic effects of ethnic background and APOE ε4 carrier 
status. Our results suggest that sex-dependent differences of aging between 
ethnic backgrounds may be due to ethnicity-dependent effects of genetic risk 
factors, such as APOE ε4. We also presented the normative information on volume 
estimates of the brain structures of the elderly Korean people in the subdivided 
age groups. This normative information of the aging brain stratified by 
ethnicity provides the age-related reference ranges quantified to replace visual 
judgment and facilitate precise clinical decision-making.

INTRODUCTION: Prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression based on 
baseline measures allows us to understand disease progression and has 
implications in decisions concerning treatment strategy. To this end, we combine 
a predictive multi-task machine learning method (cFSGL) with a novel MR-based 
multivariate morphometric surface map of the hippocampus (mTBM) to predict 
future cognitive scores of patients.
METHODS: Previous work has shown that a multi-task learning framework that 
performs prediction of all future time points simultaneously (cFSGL) can be used 
to encode both sparsity as well as temporal smoothness. The authors showed that 
this method is able to predict cognitive outcomes of ADNI subjects using 
FreeSurfer-based baseline MRI features, MMSE score demographic information and 
ApoE status. Whilst volumetric information may hold generalized information on 
brain status, we hypothesized that hippocampus specific information may be more 
useful in predictive modeling of AD. To this end, we applied a multivariate 
tensor-based parametric surface analysis method (mTBM) to extract features from 
the hippocampal surfaces.
RESULTS: We combined mTBM features with traditional surface features such as 
middle axis distance, the Jacobian determinant as well as 2 of the Jacobian 
principal eigenvalues to yield 7 normalized hippocampal surface maps of 300 
points each. By combining these 7 × 300 = 2100 features together with the 
previous ~350 features, we illustrate how this type of sparsifying method can be 
applied to an entire surface map of the hippocampus that yields a feature space 
that is 2 orders of magnitude larger than what was previously attempted.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining the power of the cFSGL multi-task machine learning 
framework with the addition of AD sensitive mTBM feature maps of the hippocampus 
surface, we are able to improve the predictive performance of ADAS cognitive 
scores 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months from baseline.

We propose a novel method for the automatic segmentation of brain MRI images by 
using discriminative dictionary learning and sparse coding techniques. In the 
proposed method, dictionaries and classifiers are learned simultaneously from a 
set of brain atlases, which can then be used for the reconstruction and 
segmentation of an unseen target image. The proposed segmentation strategy is 
based on image reconstruction, which is in contrast to most existing atlas-based 
labeling approaches that rely on comparing image similarities between atlases 
and target images. In addition, we propose a Fixed Discriminative Dictionary 
Learning for Segmentation (F-DDLS) strategy, which can learn dictionaries 
offline and perform segmentations online, enabling a significant speed-up in the 
segmentation stage. The proposed method has been evaluated for the hippocampus 
segmentation of 80 healthy ICBM subjects and 202 ADNI images. The robustness of 
the proposed method, especially of our F-DDLS strategy, was validated by 
training and testing on different subject groups in the ADNI database. The 
influence of different parameters was studied and the performance of the 
proposed method was also compared with that of the nonlocal patch-based 
approach. The proposed method achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.879 on 202 
ADNI images and 0.890 on 80 ICBM subjects, which is competitive compared with 
state-of-the-art methods.

BACKGROUND: Regional cortical thickness (rCTh) among cognitively normal (CN) 
adults (rCThCN) varies greatly between brain regions, as does the vulnerability 
to neurodegeneration.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to: 1) rank order rCThCN for various brain 
regions, and 2) explore their vulnerability to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) within these brain regions.
METHODS: The relationship between rCTh among the CN group (rCThCN) and the 
percent difference in CTh (% CThDiff) in each region between the CN group and AD 
patients was examined. Pearson correlation analysis was performed accounting for 
amyloid-β (Aβ) protein and APOE genotype using 210 age, gender, and APOE matched 
CN (n = 105, age range: 56-90) and AD (n = 105, age range: 56-90) ADNI 
participants.
RESULTS: Strong positive correlations were observed between rCThCN and % CThDiff 
accounting for Aβ deposition and APOE status. Regions, such as the entorhinal 
cortex, which had the greatest CTh in the CN state, were also the regions which 
had the greatest % CThDiff.
CONCLUSIONS: Regions with the greatest CTh at the CN stage are found to 
aggregate in disease prone regions of AD, namely in the medial temporal lobe, 
including the temporal pole, ERC, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform and the middle 
and inferior temporal gyrus. Although rCTh has been found to vary considerably 
across the different regions of the brain, our results indicate that regions 
with the greatest CTh at the CN stage are actually regions which have been found 
to be most vulnerable to neurodegeneration in AD.

PURPOSE: The cerebral ventricles deform in a non-uniform fashion in response to 
increased CSF volume and/or pressure in hydrocephalic syndromes. Current 
research is focused on volumetric analyses, while topological analysis of 
ventricular surfaces remains understudied. We developed a method of 
quantitatively modeling the curvature of ventricular surfaces to analyze changes 
in ventricular surfaces in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), using the left frontal horn as an example.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients with NPH were recruited from our institution, and 
21 healthy controls (HC) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were 
identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
On T1-weighted fine-cut magnetic resonance sequences, 3D Slicer was used to 
segment the left frontal horn. Next, the mean curvatures at a set of points on 
the ventricular surface were determined. The frontal horns were scaled and 
centered into normalized volumes, allowing for pooling across the study 
subjects. The frontal horn was divided into superolateral, superomedial, 
inferolateral, and inferomedial surfaces, and locoregional mean curvatures were 
analyzed. Statistical comparisons were made between NPH, AD, and HC groups.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the mean curvature of lateral surfaces of 
the ventricles distinguished patterns of distortion between all three cohorts. 
Significant flattening of the superomedial surface discriminated NPH from HC and 
AD. However, significant rounding of the inferomedial surface compared to 
controls was a distinguishing feature of NPH alone.
CONCLUSION: NPH ventricles deform non-uniformly. The pattern of surface 
distortion may be used as an additional tool to differentiate between these 
hydrocephalic conditions.

Introduction: While the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases associated with 
dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases, our knowledge on the 
underlying mechanisms, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets is limited. In 
this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modeling links 
phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease 
mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment. Methods: The 
Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows 
standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole 
brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that 
quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal 
population dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with 
positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the 
phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta 
(Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on an averaged healthy 
connectome and individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 8) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD, N = 10) and 
in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N = 15) using data from ADNI-3 data base 
(http://adni.loni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta 
burden modulates regional Excitation-Inhibition balance, leading to local 
hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural 
activity and electroencephalograms (EEG). Results: Known empirical alterations 
of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The 
virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials 
and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is 
crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with 
homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network 
hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population 
models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale 
alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains. Discussion: We 
demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by 
pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.

Longitudinal hippocampal atrophy is commonly used as progressive marker 
assisting clinical diagnose of dementia. However, precise quantification of the 
atrophy is limited by longitudinal segmentation errors resulting from MRI 
artifacts across multiple independent scans. To accurately segment the 
hippocampal morphology from longitudinal 3T T1-weighted MR images, we propose a 
diffeomorphic geodesic guided deep learning method called the GeoLongSeg to 
mitigate the longitudinal variabilities that unrelated to diseases by enhancing 
intra-individual morphological consistency. Specifically, we integrate geodesic 
shape regression, an evolutional model that estimates smooth deformation process 
of anatomical shapes, into a two-stage segmentation network. We adopt a 3D U-Net 
in the first-stage network with an enhanced attention mechanism for independent 
segmentation. Then, a hippocampal shape evolutional trajectory is estimated by 
geodesic shape regression and fed into the second network to refine the 
independent segmentation. We verify that GeoLongSeg outperforms other four 
state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines in longitudinal morphological 
consistency evaluated by test-retest reliability, variance ratio and atrophy 
trajectories. When assessing hippocampal atrophy in longitudinal data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), results based on GeoLongSeg 
exhibit spatial and temporal local atrophy in bilateral hippocampi of dementia 
patients. These features derived from GeoLongSeg segmentation exhibit the 
greatest discriminatory capability compared to the outcomes of other methods in 
distinguishing between patients and normal controls. Overall, GeoLongSeg 
provides an accurate and efficient segmentation network for extracting 
hippocampal morphology from longitudinal MR images, which assist precise atrophy 
measurement of the hippocampus in early stage of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal atrophy is a supportive feature for the diagnosis of 
probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, even for an expert neuroradiologist, 
tracing the hippocampus and measuring its volume is a time consuming and 
extremely challenging task. Accordingly, the development of reliable 
fully-automated segmentation algorithms is of paramount importance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study evaluates (i) the precision and the 
robustness of the novel Hippocampal Unified Multi-Atlas Network (HUMAN) 
segmentation algorithm and (ii) its clinical reliability for AD diagnosis. For 
these purposes, we used a mixed cohort of 456 subjects and their T1 weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The cohort included 145 controls 
(CTRL), 217 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 94 AD patients from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each subject the 
baseline, repeat, 12 and 24 month follow-up scans were available.
RESULTS: HUMAN provides hippocampal volumes with a 3% precision; volume 
measurements effectively reveal AD, with an area under the curve (AUC) 
AUC1 = 0.08 ± 0.02. Segmented volumes can also reveal the subtler effects 
present in MCI subjects, AUC2 = 0.76 ± 0.05. The algorithm is stable and 
reproducible over time, even for 24 month follow-up scans.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results demonstrate HUMAN is a precise 
segmentation algorithm, besides hippocampal volumes, provided by HUMAN, can 
effectively support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and become a useful 
tool for other neuroimaging applications.

INTRODUCTION: Currently, there are no tools that can accurately predict which 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Texture analysis uses image processing and statistical methods to 
identify patterns in voxel intensities that cannot be appreciated by visual 
inspection. Our main objective was to determine whether MRI texture could be 
used to predict conversion of MCI to AD.
METHODS: A method of 3-dimensional, whole-brain texture analysis was used to 
compute texture features from T1-weighted MR images. To assess predictive value, 
texture changes were compared between MCI converters and nonconverters over a 
3-year observation period. A predictive model using texture and clinical factors 
was used to predict conversion of patients with MCI to AD. This model was then 
tested on ten randomly selected test groups from the data set.
RESULTS: Texture features were found to be significantly different between 
normal controls (n = 225), patients with MCI (n = 382), and patients with AD 
(n = 183). A subset of the patients with MCI were used to compare between MCI 
converters (n = 98) and nonconverters (n = 106). A composite model including 
texture features, APOE-ε4 genotype, Mini-Mental Status Examination score, sex, 
and hippocampal occupancy resulted in an area under curve of 0.905. Application 
of the composite model to ten randomly selected test groups (nonconverters = 26, 
converters = 24) predicted MCI conversion with a mean accuracy of 76.2%.
DISCUSSION: Early texture changes are detected in patients with MCI who 
eventually progress to AD dementia. Therefore, whole-brain 3D texture analysis 
has the potential to predict progression of patients with MCI to AD.

Recent developments of tau Positron Emission Tomography (PET) allows assessment 
of regional neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) deposition in human brain. Among the 
tau PET molecular probes, 18F-AV1451 is characterized by high selectivity for 
pathologic tau aggregates over amyloid plaques, limited non-specific binding in 
white and gray matter, and confined off-target binding. The objectives of the 
study are (1) to quantitatively characterize regional brain tau deposition 
measured by 18F-AV1451 PET in cognitively normal older adults (CN), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants; (2) to evaluate the 
correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and 18F-AV1451 PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR); 
and (3) to evaluate the partial volume effects on 18F-AV1451 brain uptake. 
Methods: The study included total 115 participants (CN = 49, MCI = 58, and AD = 
8) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Preprocessed 
18F-AV1451 PET images, structural MRIs, and demographic and clinical assessments 
were downloaded from the ADNI database. A reblurred Van Cittertiteration method 
was used for voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC) on PET images. Structural 
MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization and region of interest (ROI) 
definition in standard space. The parametric images of 18F-AV1451 SUVR relative 
to cerebellum were calculated. The ROI SUVR measurements from PVC and non-PVC 
SUVR images were compared. The correlation between ROI 18F-AV1451 SUVR and the 
measurements of MMSE, CSF total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were 
also assessed. Results: 18F-AV1451 prominently specific binding was found in the 
amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampus, fusiform, posterior cingulate, 
temporal, parietal, and frontal brain regions. Most regional SUVRs showed 
significantly higher uptake of 18F-AV1451 in AD than MCI and CN participants. 
SUVRs of small regions like amygdala, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus were 
statistically improved by PVC in all groups (p < 0.01). Although there was an 
increasing tendency of 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs in MCI group compared with CN group, no 
significant difference of 18F-AV1451 deposition was found between CN and MCI 
brains with or without PVC (p > 0.05). Declined MMSE score was observed with 
increasing 18F-AV1451 binding in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampus, 
and fusiform. CSF p-tau was positively correlated with 18F-AV1451 deposition. 
PVC improved the results of 18F-AV-1451 tau deposition and correlation studies 
in small brain regions. Conclusion: The typical deposition of 18F-AV1451 tau PET 
imaging in AD brain was found in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform and 
parahippocampus, and these regions were strongly associated with cognitive 
impairment and CSF biomarkers. Although more deposition was observed in MCI 
group, the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging could not differentiate the MCI patients from 
CN population. More tau deposition related to decreased MMSE score and increased 
level of CSF p-tau, especially in ROIs of amygdala, entorhinal cortex and 
parahippocampus. PVC did improve the results of tau deposition and correlation 
studies in small brain regions and suggest to be routinely used in 18F-AV1451 
tau PET quantification.

Magnetic resonance (MR) based shape analysis provides an opportunity to detect 
regional specificity of volumetric changes that may distinguish mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from healthy elderly controls 
(CON), and predict future conversion to AD. We assessed the surface deformation 
of seven structures (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus 
pallidus, body and temporal horn of the lateral ventricles) in 383 MRI volumes, 
based on data shared through the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to identify regionally-specific shape 
abnormalities in MCI and AD. Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping 
(LDDMM) was used to generate the shapes of seven structures based on template 
shapes injected into segmented subcortical volumes. LDDMM then constructed the 
surface deformation maps encoding the local shape variation of each subject 
relative to the template. Hierarchical models were developed to detect 
differences in local shape in MCI and AD relative to CON. Our findings revealed 
that surface inward-deformation in MCI and AD is most prominent in the anterior 
hippocampal segment and the basolateral complex of the amygdala. Most pronounced 
surface outward-deformation in MCI and AD occurs in the lateral ventricles. Mild 
surface inward-deformation in MCI and AD occurs in the anterior-lateral and 
ventral-lateral aspects of the thalamus, with no evidence of regionally-specific 
deformation in the putamen or globus pallidus. Although the locations of the 
shape abnormalities in MCI and AD are primarily within the mesial temporal 
region, analyses support distinct components of correlated shape variation that 
may help predict future MCI conversion.

We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
investigate changes in the thalamus functional connectivity in early and late 
stages of amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Data of 25 late stages of amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) patients, 30 early stages of amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (EMCI) patients and 30 well-matched healthy controls (HC) 
were analyzed from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We 
focused on the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the 
thalamus and those in all other brain regions. Compared to healthy controls, we 
found functional connectivity between the left/right thalamus and a set of brain 
areas was decreased in LMCI and/or EMCI including right fusiform gyrus (FG), 
left and right superior temporal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus extending into 
supplementary motor area, right insula, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) 
extending into middle occipital gyrus (MOG). We also observed increased 
functional connectivity between the left/right thalamus and several regions in 
LMCI and/or EMCI including left FG, right MOG, left and right precuneus, right 
MTG and left inferior temporal gyrus. In the direct comparison between the LMCI 
and EMCI groups, we obtained several brain regions showed thalamus-seeded 
functional connectivity differences such as the precentral gyrus, hippocampus, 
FG and MTG. Briefly, these brain regions mentioned above were mainly located in 
the thalamo-related networks including thalamo-hippocampus, thalamo-temporal, 
thalamo-visual, and thalamo-default mode network. The decreased functional 
connectivity of the thalamus might suggest reduced functional integrity of 
thalamo-related networks and increased functional connectivity indicated that 
aMCI patients could use additional brain resources to compensate for the loss of 
cognitive function. Our study provided a new sight to understand the two 
important states of aMCI and revealed resting-state fMRI is an appropriate 
method for exploring pathophysiological changes in aMCI.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 are known to cause familial 
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) but common variants in PSEN1 have not 
been found to strongly influence late-onset AD (LOAD). The association of rare 
variants in PSEN1 with LOAD-related endophenotypes has received little 
attention. In this study, we performed a rare variant association analysis of 
PSEN1 with quantitative biomarkers of LOAD using whole genome sequencing (WGS) 
by integrating bioinformatics and imaging informatics.
METHODS: A WGS data set (N = 815) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort was used in this analysis. 757 non-Hispanic Caucasian 
participants underwent WGS from a blood sample and high resolution T1-weighted 
structural MRI at baseline. An automated MRI analysis technique (FreeSurfer) was 
used to measure cortical thickness and volume of neuroanatomical structures. We 
assessed imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as LOAD-related 
quantitative endophenotypes. Single variant analyses were performed using PLINK 
and gene-based analyses of rare variants were performed using the optimal 
Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O).
RESULTS: A total of 839 rare variants (MAF < 1/√(2 N) = 0.0257) were found 
within a region of ±10 kb from PSEN1. Among them, six exonic (three 
non-synonymous) variants were observed. A single variant association analysis 
showed that the PSEN1 p. E318G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in 
participants carrying APOE ε4 allele where individuals carrying the minor allele 
of this PSEN1 risk variant have lower CSF Aβ1-42 and higher CSF tau. A 
gene-based analysis resulted in a significant association of rare but not common 
(MAF ≥ 0.0257) PSEN1 variants with bilateral entorhinal cortical thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that PSEN1 rare variants 
collectively show a significant association with the brain atrophy in regions 
preferentially affected by LOAD, providing further support for a role of PSEN1 
in LOAD. The PSEN1 p. E318G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in APOE ε4 
carriers. Integrating bioinformatics with imaging informatics for identification 
of rare variants could help explain the missing heritability in LOAD.

BACKGROUND: The APOE ε4 allele is the most significant common genetic risk 
factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The region surrounding APOE on 
chromosome 19 has also shown consistent association with LOAD. However, no 
common variants in the region remain significant after adjusting for APOE 
genotype. We report a rare variant association analysis of genes in the vicinity 
of APOE with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging biomarkers of LOAD.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 817 blood DNA samples 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Sequence data from 
757 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants was used in the present analysis. We 
extracted all rare variants (MAF (minor allele frequency) < 0.05) within a 
312 kb window in APOE's vicinity encompassing 12 genes. We assessed CSF and 
neuroimaging (MRI and PET) biomarkers as LOAD-related quantitative 
endophenotypes. Gene-based analyses of rare variants were performed using the 
optimal Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O).
RESULTS: A total of 3,334 rare variants (MAF < 0.05) were found within the APOE 
region. Among them, 72 rare non-synonymous variants were observed. Eight genes 
spanning the APOE region were significantly associated with CSF Aβ1-42 
(p < 1.0 × 10-3). After controlling for APOE genotype and adjusting for multiple 
comparisons, 4 genes (CBLC, BCAM, APOE, and RELB) remained significant. 
Whole-brain surface-based analysis identified highly significant clusters 
associated with rare variants of CBLC in the temporal lobe region including the 
entorhinal cortex, as well as frontal lobe regions. Whole-brain voxel-wise 
analysis of amyloid PET identified significant clusters in the bilateral frontal 
and parietal lobes showing associations of rare variants of RELB with cortical 
amyloid burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Rare variants within genes spanning the APOE region are 
significantly associated with LOAD-related CSF Aβ1-42 and neuroimaging 
biomarkers after adjusting for APOE genotype. These findings warrant further 
investigation and illustrate the role of next generation sequencing and 
quantitative endophenotypes in assessing rare variants which may help explain 
missing heritability in AD and other complex diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Functional brain connectivity of resting-state networks varies as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses. However, our understanding of the dynamic 
longitudinal changes that occur in the brain over the course of AD is sometimes 
contradictory and lacking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed whole-brain networks 
connectivity using longitudinal resting-state fMRI data from 132 participants 
from ADNI dataset. The cohort was divided into four groups: 20 AD, 35 CN, 46 
Early MCI, and 31 Late MCI Cross-sectional analyses were conducted at baseline 
and follow-up (approximately two years apart), with longitudinal changes 
assessed within and between groups.
RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses revealed that all groups differed 
significantly from AD in global network properties at both time points, with 
EMCI also showing disrupted topological metrics compared to CN. Longitudinal 
analyses highlighted notable changes in small-worldness (σ), global clustering 
coefficient (Cp), and normalized characteristic path length (λ) across groups. 
Both EMCI and LMCI groups showed significant alterations in global efficiency 
(Eglob), Cp, and σ over time. Pairwise comparisons also revealed significant 
interaction effects, particularly between CN-EMCI and CN-AD groups. All groups 
showed notable changes in σ, λ, and Cp, according to within-group longitudinal 
changes. Furthermore, distinct changes in Eglob over time were observed in the 
LMCI and EMCI groups. Almost all subnetwork attributes demonstrated significant 
changes between patients at various phases in both time intervals.
CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize significant connectivity alterations across 
all groups at both baseline and follow-up, with longitudinal analyses 
underscoring the progression of these changes. Graph theory metrics provide 
valuable insights into the transition from normal cognition to AD, potentially 
serving as biomarkers for disease progression.

Changes in several regions within the brain have been associated with 
progression from healthy aging to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the 
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). In this 
study, the IPL was divided into three subregions: the gyrus, the banks of the 
sulcus, and the fundus to determine if these regions are independent of medial 
temporal regions in the progression of AD. Participants of the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI); n = 54) underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and 
neuropsychological examination, and were categorized as normal controls, mild 
cognitively impaired (MCI), or AD. FreeSurfer was initially used to identify the 
boundaries of the IPL. Each subregion was then manually traced based on 
FreeSurfer curvature intensities. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to 
compare groups. Results suggest that changes in thickness of the banks of the 
inferior parietal lobule are occurring early in the progression from normal to 
MCI, followed by changes in the gyrus and fundus, and these measures are related 
to neuropsychological performance.

Segmentation of the hippocampus (HC) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an 
essential step for diagnosis and monitoring of several clinical situations such 
as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and epilepsy. Automatic segmentation 
of HC structures is challenging due to their small volume, complex shape, low 
contrast and discontinuous boundaries. The active contour model (ACM) with a 
statistical shape prior is robust. However, it is difficult to build a shape 
prior that is general enough to cover all possible shapes of the HC and that 
suffers the problems of complicated registration of the shape prior and the 
target object and of low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic 
model that combines a deep belief network (DBN) and the lattice Boltzmann (LB) 
method for the segmentation of HC. The training process of DBN consists of 
unsupervised bottom-up training and supervised training of a top restricted 
Boltzmann machine (RBM). Given an input image, the trained DBN is utilized to 
infer the patient-specific shape prior of the HC. The specific shape prior is 
not only used to determine the initial contour, but is also introduced into the 
LB model as part of the external force to refine the segmentation. We used a 
subset of OASIS-1 as the training set and the preliminary release of EADC-ADNI 
as the testing set. The segmentation results of our method have good correlation 
and consistency with the manual segmentation results.

BACKGROUND: The European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Harmonized Protocol (HarP) is a Delphi definition 
of manual hippocampal segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that 
can be used as the standard of truth to train new tracers, and to validate 
automated segmentation algorithms. Training requires large and representative 
data sets of segmented hippocampi. This work aims to produce a set of HarP 
labels for the proper training and certification of tracers and algorithms.
METHODS: Sixty-eight 1.5 T and 67 3 T volumetric structural ADNI scans from 
different subjects, balanced by age, medial temporal atrophy, and scanner 
manufacturer, were segmented by five qualified HarP tracers whose absolute 
interrater intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.953 and 0.975 (left and 
right). Labels were validated as HarP compliant through centralized quality 
check and correction.
RESULTS: Hippocampal volumes (mm(3)) were as follows: controls: left = 3060 
(standard deviation [SD], 502), right = 3120 (SD, 897); mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI): left = 2596 (SD, 447), right = 2686 (SD, 473); and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD): left = 2301 (SD, 492), right = 2445 (SD, 525). Volumes 
significantly correlated with atrophy severity at Scheltens' scale (Spearman's ρ 
= <-0.468, P = <.0005). Cerebrospinal fluid spaces (mm(3)) were as follows: 
controls: left = 23 (32), right = 25 (25); MCI: left = 15 (13), right = 22 (16); 
and AD: left = 11 (13), right = 20 (25). Five subjects (3.7%) presented with 
unusual anatomy.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides reference hippocampal labels for the training 
and certification of automated segmentation algorithms. The publicly released 
labels will allow the widespread implementation of the standard segmentation 
protocol.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the abnormalities of the three-dimensional 
pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D PCASL) based cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) correlation networks in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: 3D PCASL images of 53 cognitive normal (CN) subjects, 43 subjects with 
MCI, and 30 subjects with AD were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Whole-brain CBF maps were calculated 
using PCASL and proton density-weighted images (PDWI). The 246 regional CBF 
values, including the cortex and subcortex, were obtained after registering the 
Brainnetome Atlas to the individual CBF maps. The Pearson correlation 
coefficient between every two regions across subjects was calculated to 
construct the CBF correlation network. Then the topologies of CBF networks with 
regard to global properties (global network efficiency, clustering coefficient, 
characteristic path length, and small-world properties), hub regions, nodal 
properties (betweenness centrality, BC), and connections were compared among CN, 
MCI, and AD. Significant changes in the global and nodal properties were 
observed in the permutation tests, and connections with significant differences 
survived after the z-statistic and false discovery rate (FDR) correction.
RESULTS: The CBF correlation networks of CN, MCI, and AD all showed small-world 
properties. Compared with CN, global efficiency decreased significantly in AD. 
Significant differences in nodal properties and a loss of hub regions are noted 
in the middle temporal lobe in both MCI and AD. In the frontal lobe, BC is 
reduced in MCI while it is increased in the occipital lobe in AD. The identified 
altered hub regions with significant differences in MCI and AD were mainly 
distributed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In addition, disrupted hub 
regions in AD with significantly decreased connections were mainly found in the 
precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and hippocampus-cortical cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive 3D PCASL-based CBF correlation networks are capable of 
showing changes in topological organization in subjects with MCI and AD, and the 
observed disruption in the topological organization may underlie cognitive 
decline in MCI and AD.

The hippocampus is among the first structures affected in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Hippocampal magnetic resonance imaging volumetry is a potential biomarker 
for AD but is hindered by the limitations of manual segmentation. We proposed a 
fully automatic method using probabilistic and anatomical priors for hippocampus 
segmentation. Probabilistic information is derived from 16 young controls and 
anatomical knowledge is modeled with automatically detected landmarks. The 
results were previously evaluated by comparison with manual segmentation on data 
from the 16 young healthy controls, with a leave-one-out strategy, and eight 
patients with AD. High accuracy was found for both groups (volume error 6 and 
7%, overlap 87 and 86%, respectively). In this article, the method was used to 
segment 145 patients with AD, 294 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and 166 elderly normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative database. On the basis of a qualitative rating protocol, the 
segmentation proved acceptable in 94% of the cases. We used the obtained 
hippocampal volumes to automatically discriminate between AD patients, MCI 
patients, and elderly controls. The classification proved accurate: 76% of the 
patients with AD and 71% of the MCI converting to AD before 18 months were 
correctly classified with respect to the elderly controls, using only 
hippocampal volume.

Recent findings suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disconnection 
syndrome characterized by abnormalities in large-scale networks. However, the 
alterations that occur in network topology during the prodromal stages of AD, 
particularly in patients with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those 
that show a slow or faster progression to dementia, are still poorly understood. 
In this study, we used graph theory to assess the organization of structural MRI 
networks in stable MCI (sMCI) subjects, late MCI converters (lMCIc), early MCI 
converters (eMCIc), and AD patients from 2 large multicenter cohorts: ADNI and 
AddNeuroMed. Our findings showed an abnormal global network organization in all 
patient groups, as reflected by an increased path length, reduced transitivity, 
and increased modularity compared with controls. In addition, lMCIc, eMCIc, and 
AD patients showed a decreased path length and mean clustering compared with the 
sMCI group. At the local level, there were nodal clustering decreases mostly in 
AD patients, while the nodal closeness centrality detected abnormalities across 
all patient groups, showing overlapping changes in the hippocampi and amygdala 
and nonoverlapping changes in parietal, entorhinal, and orbitofrontal regions. 
These findings suggest that the prodromal and clinical stages of AD are 
associated with an abnormal network topology.

MRI-based hippocampus volume, a core feasible biomarker of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), is not yet widely used in clinical patient care, partly due to lack of 
validation of software tools for hippocampal volumetry that are compatible with 
routine workflow. Here, we evaluate fully-automated and computationally 
efficient hippocampal volumetry with FSL-FIRST for prediction of AD dementia 
(ADD) in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from phase 1 of 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Receiver operating 
characteristic analysis of FSL-FIRST hippocampal volume (corrected for head size 
and age) revealed an area under the curve of 0.79, 0.70, and 0.70 for prediction 
of aMCI-to-ADD conversion within 12, 24, or 36 months, respectively. Thus, 
FSL-FIRST provides about the same power for prediction of progression to ADD in 
aMCI as other volumetry methods.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) shows the most aging-related brain metabolic 
dysfunction that correlates with decreasing executive processing in otherwise 
healthy, cognitively intact volunteers. Here, data from ADNI are used to 
elucidate potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in cognitive aging, 
that is, age-related decline in cognitive performance in the absence of known 
neurodegenerative disease. Amyloid-negative volunteers showed statistically 
significant mediation of ACC metabolism in the relationship between age and 
verbal fluency. A nonlinguistic task of executive function, Trails B, showed 
also negative correlation between performance and age, albeit weaker, but was 
not significant in the mediation analysis. Recall of story items, minimizing 
attentional demands compared with learning of word lists, did not correlate with 
age. ADNI subjects selected for low vascular risks also showed correlation 
between age and declining ACC metabolism. In the whole-brain amyloid-negative 
subset, ACC amyloid was not correlated with age. As expected, the metabolism in 
an arbitrary region such as motor cortex that was not expected to decline with 
cognitive aging showed no correlation with age or ACC metabolism suggesting 
regional specificity. These findings motivate the search for the pathophysiology 
of aging-related ACC dysfunction to prevent, diagnose, and treat the decline in 
executive function associated with cognitive aging.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multi-center study 
assessing neuroimaging in diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring. Amnestic Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often represents a prodromal form of dementia, 
conferring a 10-15% annual risk of converting to probable AD. We analyzed 
baseline 1.5T MRI scans in 693 participants from the ADNI cohort divided into 
four groups by baseline diagnosis and one year MCI to probable AD conversion 
status to identify neuroimaging phenotypes associated with MCI and AD and 
potential predictive markers of imminent conversion. MP-RAGE scans were analyzed 
using publicly available voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automated 
parcellation methods. Measures included global and hippocampal grey matter (GM) 
density, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, and cortical thickness values from 
entorhinal cortex and other temporal and parietal lobe regions. The overall 
pattern of structural MRI changes in MCI (n=339) and AD (n=148) compared to 
healthy controls (HC, n=206) was similar to prior findings in smaller samples. 
MCI-Converters (n=62) demonstrated a very similar pattern of atrophic changes to 
the AD group up to a year before meeting clinical criteria for AD. Finally, a 
comparison of effect sizes for contrasts between the MCI-Converters and 
MCI-Stable (n=277) groups on MRI metrics indicated that degree of 
neurodegeneration of medial temporal structures was the best antecedent MRI 
marker of imminent conversion, with decreased hippocampal volume (left > right) 
being the most robust. Validation of imaging biomarkers is important as they can 
help enrich clinical trials of disease modifying agents by identifying 
individuals at highest risk for progression to AD.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the 
entorhinal regions are key Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers, but the spatial Aβ 
pathways influencing tau pathology remain unclear.
METHODS: We applied predictive modeling to identify Aβ standardized uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) spatial patterns that predict entorhinal tau levels, future 
hippocampal volume, and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) 
scores at 5-year follow-up. The model was trained on Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 237), incorporating amyloid-PET (positron 
emission tomography), tau-PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive 
data, and validated on Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) (N = 276).
RESULTS: The model accurately predicted entorhinal tau levels (r = 0.48, 
p < 0.0001), future hippocampal volume (r = 0.24, p = 0.002), and PACC scores 
(r = 0.35, p < 0.0001) based on regional Aβ.
DISCUSSION: Aβ in the rostral middle frontal, medial orbitofrontal, and striatal 
regions predict entorhinal tau levels, future hippocampal volume, and PACC 
scores, indicating their potential as early biomarkers in AD prediction models.
HIGHLIGHTS: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging reveals amyloid beta (Aβ) 
patterns predicting entorhinal tau levels in preclinical Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Aβ in medial orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and nucleus accumbens 
best predicts tau. Aβ distribution in these regions predicts future hippocampal 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Model validated with Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) data 
sets, showing robustness and reproducibility. Findings suggest early Aβ patterns 
can aid in diagnosing AD and guide anti-Aβ therapies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different biomarkers for AD may potentially be 
complementary in diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Our aim was to combine MR 
imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers in the diagnostic classification and 2-year 
prognosis of MCI and AD, by examining the following: 1) which measures are most 
sensitive to diagnostic status, 2) to what extent the methods provide unique 
information in diagnostic classification, and 3) which measures are most 
predictive of clinical decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADNI baseline MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 42 
controls, 73 patients with MCI, and 38 patients with AD; and 2-year clinical 
follow-up data for 36 controls, 51 patients with MCI, and 25 patients with AD 
were analyzed. The hippocampus and entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial, 
precuneus, inferior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, lateral, and 
medial orbitofrontal cortices were used as regions of interest. CSF variables 
included Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/Abeta42 and p-tau/Abeta42. 
Regression analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of measures to 
diagnostic status as well as 2-year change in CDR-SB, MMSE, and delayed logical 
memory in MCI.
RESULTS: Hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/Abeta42 uniquely 
predicted diagnostic group. Change in CDR-SB was best predicted by retrosplenial 
thickness; MMSE, by retrosplenial metabolism and thickness; and delayed logical 
memory, by hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: All biomarkers were sensitive to the diagnostic group. Combining MR 
imaging morphometry and CSF biomarkers improved diagnostic classification 
(controls versus AD). MR imaging morphometry and PET were largely overlapping in 
value for discrimination. Baseline MR imaging and PET measures were more 
predictive of clinical change in MCI than were CSF measures.

Automatic segmentation methods are important tools for quantitative analysis of 
Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Recently, patch-based label fusion approaches 
have demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we 
introduce a new patch-based label fusion framework to perform segmentation of 
anatomical structures. The proposed approach uses an Optimized PAtchMatch Label 
fusion (OPAL) strategy that drastically reduces the computation time required 
for the search of similar patches. The reduced computation time of OPAL opens 
the way for new strategies and facilitates processing on large databases. In 
this paper, we investigate new perspectives offered by OPAL, by introducing a 
new multi-scale and multi-feature framework. During our validation on 
hippocampus segmentation we use two datasets: young adults in the ICBM cohort 
and elderly adults in the EADC-ADNI dataset. For both, OPAL is compared to 
state-of-the-art methods. Results show that OPAL obtained the highest median 
Dice coefficient (89.9% for ICBM and 90.1% for EADC-ADNI). Moreover, in both 
cases, OPAL produced a segmentation accuracy similar to inter-expert 
variability. On the EADC-ADNI dataset, we compare the hippocampal volumes 
obtained by manual and automatic segmentation. The volumes appear to be highly 
correlated that enables to perform more accurate separation of pathological 
populations.

Functional MRI (fMRI) is a prominent imaging technique to probe brain function, 
however, a substantial proportion of noise from multiple sources influences the 
reliability and reproducibility of fMRI data analysis and limits its clinical 
applications. Extensive effort has been devoted to improving fMRI data quality, 
but in the last two decades, there is no consensus reached which technique is 
more effective. In this study, we developed a novel deep neural network for 
denoising fMRI data, named denoising neural network (DeNN). This deep neural 
network is 1) applicable without requiring externally recorded data to model 
noise; 2) spatially and temporally adaptive to the variability of noise in 
different brain regions at different time points; 3) automated to output 
denoised data without manual interference; 4) trained and applied on each 
subject separately and 5) insensitive to the repetition time (TR) of fMRI data. 
When we compared DeNN with a number of nuisance regression methods for denoising 
fMRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, only 
DeNN had connectivity for functionally uncorrelated regions close to zero and 
successfully identified unbiased correlations between the posterior cingulate 
cortex seed and multiple brain regions within the default mode network or task 
positive network. The whole brain functional connectivity maps computed with 
DeNN-denoised data are approximately three times as homogeneous as the 
functional connectivity maps computed with raw data. Furthermore, the improved 
homogeneity strengthens rather than weakens the statistical power of fMRI in 
detecting intrinsic functional differences between cognitively normal subjects 
and subjects with Alzheimer's disease.

This paper presents homogeneous clusters of patients, identified in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data population of 317 
females and 342 males, described by a total of 243 biological and clinical 
descriptors. Clustering was performed with a novel methodology, which supports 
identification of patient subpopulations that are homogeneous regarding both 
clinical and biological descriptors. Properties of the constructed clusters 
clearly demonstrate the differences between female and male Alzheimer's disease 
patient groups. The major difference is the existence of two male subpopulations 
with unexpected values of intracerebral and whole brain volumes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive deterioration of brain 
function among elderly people. Studies revealed aberrant correlations in 
spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals in resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) over a wide range of temporal 
scales. However, the study of the temporal dynamics of BOLD signals in subjects 
with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains largely unexplored. 
Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis is a method for estimating the complexity of 
finite time series over multiple time scales. In this research, we applied MSE 
analysis to investigate the abnormal complexity of BOLD signals using the 
rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) 
database. There were 30 normal controls (NCs), 33 early MCI (EMCI), 32 late MCI 
(LMCI), and 29 AD patients. Following preprocessing of the BOLD signals, 
whole-brain MSE maps across six time scales were generated using the Complexity 
Toolbox. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis on the MSE maps of four 
groups revealed significant differences in the thalamus, insula, lingual gyrus 
and inferior occipital gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and olfactory cortex, 
supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus on 
multiple time scales. Compared with the NC group, MCI and AD patients had 
significant reductions in the complexity of BOLD signals and AD patients 
demonstrated lower complexity than that of the MCI subjects. Additionally, the 
complexity of BOLD signals from the regions of interest (ROIs) was found to be 
significantly associated with cognitive decline in patient groups on multiple 
time scales. Consequently, the complexity or MSE of BOLD signals may provide an 
imaging biomarker of cognitive impairments in MCI and AD.

Hippocampus volumetry based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not yet been 
translated into everyday clinical diagnostic patient care, at least in part due 
to limited availability of appropriate software tools. In the present study, we 
evaluate a fully-automated and computationally efficient processing pipeline for 
atlas based hippocampal volumetry using freely available Statistical Parametric 
Mapping (SPM) software in 198 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1). Subjects were 
grouped into MCI stable and MCI to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) converters 
according to follow-up diagnoses at 12, 24, and 36 months. Hippocampal grey 
matter volume (HGMV) was obtained from baseline T1-weighted MRI and then 
corrected for total intracranial volume and age. Average processing time per 
subject was less than 4 minutes on a standard PC. The area under the receiver 
operator characteristic curve of the corrected HGMV for identification of MCI to 
probable AD converters within 12, 24, and 36 months was 0.78, 0.72, and 0.71, 
respectively. Thus, hippocampal volume computed with the fully-automated 
processing pipeline provides similar power for prediction of MCI to probable AD 
conversion as computationally more expensive methods. The whole processing 
pipeline has been made freely available as an SPM8 toolbox. It is easily set up 
and integrated into everyday clinical patient care.

Automatic and reliable segmentation of the hippocampus from magnetic resonance 
(MR) brain images is extremely important in a variety of neuroimage studies. To 
improve the hippocampus segmentation performance, a local binary pattern based 
feature extraction method is developed for machine learning based multi-atlas 
hippocampus segmentation. Under the framework of multi-atlas image segmentation 
(MAIS), a set of selected atlases are registered to images to be segmented using 
a non-linear image registration algorithm. The registered atlases are then used 
as training data to build linear regression models for segmenting the images 
based on the image features, referred to as random local binary pattern (RLBP), 
extracted using a novel image feature extraction method. The RLBP based MAIS 
algorithm has been validated for segmenting hippocampus based on a data set of 
135 T1 MR images which are from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
database (adni.loni.usc.edu). By using manual segmentation labels produced by 
experienced tracers as the standard of truth, six segmentation evaluation 
metrics were used to evaluate the image segmentation results by comparing 
automatic segmentation results with the manual segmentation labels. We further 
computed Cohen's d effect size to investigate the sensitivity of each segmenting 
method in detecting volumetric differences of the hippocampus between different 
groups of subjects. The evaluation results showed that our method was 
competitive to state-of-the-art label fusion methods in terms of accuracy. 
Hippocampal volumetric analysis showed that the proposed RLBP method performed 
well in detecting the volumetric differences of the hippocampus between groups 
of Alzheimer's disease patients, mild cognitive impairment subjects, and normal 
controls. These results have demonstrated that the RLBP based multi-atlas image 
segmentation method could facilitate efficient and accurate extraction of the 
hippocampus and may help predict Alzheimer's disease. The codes of the proposed 
method is available (https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=1242).

Prediction of Alzheimers disease (AD) progression based on baseline measures 
allows us to understand disease progression and has implications in decisions 
concerning treatment strategy. To this end we combine a predictive multi-task 
machine learning method1 with novel MR-based multivariate morphometric surface 
map of the hippocampus2 to predict future cognitive scores of patients. Previous 
work by Zhou et al.1 has shown that a multi-task learning framework that 
performs prediction of all future time points (or tasks) simultaneously can be 
used to encode both sparsity as well as temporal smoothness. They showed that 
this can be used in predicting cognitive outcomes of Alzheimers Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects based on FreeSurfer-based baseline MRI 
features, MMSE score demographic information and ApoE status. Whilst volumetric 
information may hold generalized information on brain status, we hypothesized 
that hippocampus specific information may be more useful in predictive modeling 
of AD. To this end, we applied Shi et al.2s recently developed multivariate 
tensor-based (mTBM) parametric surface analysis method to extract features from 
the hippocampal surface. We show that by combining the power of the multi-task 
framework with the sensitivity of mTBM features of the hippocampus surface, we 
are able to improve significantly improve predictive performance of ADAS 
cognitive scores 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months from baseline.

Modern deep networks have proven to be very effective for analyzing real world 
images. However, their application in medical imaging is still in its early 
stages, primarily due to the large size of three-dimensional images, requiring 
enormous convolutional or fully connected layers - if we treat an image (and not 
image patches) as a sample. These issues only compound when the focus moves 
towards longitudinal analysis of 3D image volumes through recurrent structures, 
and when a point estimate of model parameters is insufficient in scientific 
applications where a reliability measure is necessary. Using insights from 
differential geometry, we adapt the tensor train decomposition to construct 
networks with significantly fewer parameters, allowing us to train powerful 
recurrent networks on whole brain image volume sequences. We describe the 
"orthogonal" tensor train, and demonstrate its ability to express a standard 
network layer both theoretically and empirically. We show its ability to 
effectively reconstruct whole brain volumes with faster convergence and stronger 
confidence intervals compared to the standard tensor train decomposition. We 
provide code and show experiments on the ADNI dataset using image sequences to 
regress on a cognition related outcome.

INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal volumetry can discriminate normal subjects from 
patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease 
(AD). We have analyzed the effects of different methods of hippocampal volume 
(HV) adjustment on the diagnostic accuracy of this technique.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 148 subjects of the ADNI database (48 
normal, 66 MCI, 34 AD). Brain volumes were calculated from 3T MRI scans with gm 
extractor, a fully automated script based on FSL. A series of logistic 
regression models was obtained using 9 volumes of reference and 3 methods of 
adjustment (normalization, covariance, bilinear regression). Diagnostic accuracy 
was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve method. External 
validity was assessed with 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The models with the highest area under the curve (AUC) were those 
including the HV normalized by total intracranial volume (TIV). The differences 
with bilinear regression and the covariance method adjusted by TIV were minor 
and not statistically significant. The lowest AUCs corresponded to the models 
based on raw (unadjusted) HVs. The results were qualitatively similar in two 
clinical settings (normal versus MCI, and normal versus AD), but the differences 
were higher in the normal versus MCI context.
CONCLUSION: The accuracy of hippocampal volumetry for the differential diagnosis 
between normal subjects and patients with MCI or AD was maximized by normalizing 
the HV by the TIV. Our results do not exclude the potential superiority of 
non-linear models.

Automatic and reliable segmentation of hippocampus from MR brain images is of 
great importance in studies of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy and 
Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we proposed a novel metric learning method 
to fuse segmentation labels in multi-atlas based image segmentation. Different 
from current label fusion methods that typically adopt a predefined distance 
metric model to compute a similarity measure between image patches of atlas 
images and the image to be segmented, we learn a distance metric model from the 
atlases to keep image patches of the same structure close to each other while 
those of different structures are separated. The learned distance metric model 
is then used to compute the similarity measure between image patches in the 
label fusion. The proposed method has been validated for segmenting hippocampus 
based on the EADC-ADNI dataset with manually labelled hippocampus of 100 
subjects. The experiment results demonstrated that our method achieved 
statistically significant improvement in segmentation accuracy, compared with 
state-of-the-art multi-atlas image segmentation methods.

Amyloid imaging with [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) provides in vivo data on 
plaque deposition in those with, or at risk for, Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
performed a gene-based association analysis of 15 quality-controlled 
amyloid-pathway associated candidate genes in 103 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative participants. The mean normalized PiB uptake value 
across four brain regions known to have amyloid deposition in AD was used as a 
quantitative phenotype. The minor allele of an intronic SNP within DHCR24 was 
identified and associated with a lower average PiB uptake. Further investigation 
at whole-brain voxel-wise level indicated that non-carriers of the minor allele 
had higher PiB uptake in frontal regions compared to carriers. DHCR24 has been 
previously shown to confer resistance against beta-amyloid and oxidative 
stress-induced apoptosis, thus our findings support a neuroprotective role. 
Pathway-based genetic analysis of targeted molecular imaging phenotypes appears 
promising to help elucidate disease pathophysiology and identify potential 
therapeutic targets.

OBJECTIVE: Here we aimed to explore the differences in individual gray matter 
(GM) networks at baseline in mild cognitive impairment patients who converted to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 3 years (MCI-C) and nonconverters (MCI-NC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 461 MCI patients (180 MCI-C and 281 MCI-NC) 
were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For 
each subject, a GM network was constructed using 3D-T1 imaging and the 
Kullback-Leibler divergence method. Gradient and topological analyses of 
individual GM networks were performed, and partial correlations were calculated 
to evaluate relationships among network properties, cognitive function, and 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) €4 alleles. Subsequently, a support vector machine (SVM) 
model was constructed to discriminate the MCI-C and MCI-NC patients at baseline.
RESULTS: The gradient analysis revealed that the principal gradient score 
distribution was more compressed in the MCI-C group than in the MCI-NC group, 
with scores for the left lingual gyrus, right fusiform gyrus and left middle 
temporal gyrus being increased in the MCI-C group (p < 0.05, FDR corrected). The 
topological analysis showed significant differences in nodal efficiency in four 
nodes between the two groups. Furthermore, the regional gradient scores or nodal 
efficiency were found to be significantly related to the neuropsychological test 
scores, and the left middle temporal gyrus gradient scores were positively 
associated with the number of APOE €4 alleles (r = 0.192, p = 0.002). 
Ultimately, the SVM model achieved a balanced accuracy of 79.4% in classifying 
MCI-C and MCI-NC patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The whole-brain GM network hierarchy in the MCI-C group was more 
compressed than that in the MCI-NC group, suggesting more serious cognitive 
impairments in the MCI-C group. The left middle temporal gyrus gradient scores 
were related to both cognitive function and APOE €4 alleles, thus serving as 
potential biomarkers distinguishing MCI-C from MCI-NC at baseline.

Previous studies have shown that hippocampal subfields may be differentially 
affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study used an automated analysis 
technique and two large cohorts to (1) investigate patterns of subfield volume 
loss in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, (2) determine the pattern of 
subfield volume loss due to age, gender, education, APOE ε4 genotype, and 
neuropsychological test scores, (3) compare combined subfield volumes to 
hippocampal volume alone at discriminating between AD and healthy controls (HC), 
and predicting future MCI conversion to AD at 12 months. 1,069 subjects were 
selected from the AddNeuroMed and Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI) cohorts. Freesurfer was used for automated segmentation of the 
hippocampus and hippocampal subfields. Orthogonal partial least squares to 
latent structures (OPLS) was used to train models on AD and HC subjects using 
one cohort for training and the other for testing and the combined cohort was 
used to predict MCI conversion. MANCOVA and linear regression analyses showed 
multiple subfield volumes including Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), subiculum and 
presubiculum were atrophied in AD and MCI and were related to age, gender, 
education, APOE ε4 genotype, and neuropsychological test scores. For classifying 
AD from HC, combined subfield volumes achieved comparable classification 
accuracy (81.7%) to total hippocampal (80.7%), subiculum (81.2%) and 
presubiculum (80.6%) volume. For predicting MCI conversion to AD combined 
subfield volumes and presubiculum volume were more accurate (81.1%) than total 
hippocampal volume. (76.7%).

This work is a feature-extraction and classification study between Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients and normal subjects. Voxel-wise morphological features of 
brain MRI are defined as the Jacobian determinants that measure the local volume 
change between each subject and a given atlas. The goal of this work is to 
determine the region of interest (ROI) which is best suited for classification. 
Two types of ROIs are considered: anatomical regions, that were automatically 
segmented in the atlas (amygdalae, hippocampi and lateral ventricles); and 
statistical regions, defined from group comparison statistical maps. 
Classification performance was assessed with five classifiers on 20 pairs of 
matched training and test groups of subjects from the ADNI database. In this 
study the statistical masks provided the best classification performance.

BACKGROUND: We provide and evaluate an open-source software solution for 
automatically measuring hippocampal volume and hippocampal surface roughness 
based on T1-weighted MRI, which allows for discriminating between patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls 
(NC) using only one scan.
NEW METHOD: This solution is based on a fast multiple-atlas segmentation 
technique, which combines a patch-based labeling method with an atlas-warping 
using non-rigid registrations.
RESULTS: The classifications are comparable to the best classifications in a 
large clinical dataset. For AD vs control, we obtain a high degree of accuracy, 
approximately 90%. For MCI vs control, we obtain accuracies ranging from 70% to 
78%. The average time for the hippocampal segmentation from a T1-MRI is less 
than 17min.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: In this study, we investigate a combination of 
our method with annotations using the Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol (HarP). We 
compare its capabilities with the FreeSurfer method and verify its impact on 
segmentation and diagnostic group separation capabilities. Our approach is 
developed and validated using 134 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database with annotations from HarP. Then, this 
method, tuned with the best parameters, is applied to 162 subjects from a 
private image database.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach with HarP annotations has a high level of accuracy for 
segmentation of the hippocampus and is robust to multi-site data. The 
bio-markers extracted from our proposed method have discriminative power based 
on a scalar feature, showing robustness in generalization and avoid overfitting. 
The computational time in our hippocampal segmentation algorithm has decreased 
considerably compared to other available analysis.

The aim of this paper is to develop a Bayesian functional linear Cox regression 
model (BFLCRM) with both functional and scalar covariates. This new development 
is motivated by establishing the likelihood of conversion to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) in 346 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) and the early markers of 
conversion. These 346 MCI patients were followed over 48 months, with 161 MCI 
participants progressing to AD at 48 months. The functional linear Cox 
regression model was used to establish that functional covariates including 
hippocampus surface morphology and scalar covariates including brain MRI 
volumes, cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog), and APOE status can accurately 
predict time to onset of AD. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient 
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. A simulation study is performed to evaluate 
the finite sample performance of BFLCRM.

Neurodegeneration precedes the onset of dementias such as Alzheimer's by several 
years. Recent advances in volumetric imaging allow quantification of subtle 
neuroanatomical change over time periods as short as six months. This study 
investigates whether neuroanatomical change in medial temporal lobe subregions 
is associated with later memory decline in elderly controls. Using 
high-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance images acquired at baseline and 
six-month follow-up, change in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes was 
measured in 142 healthy elderly subjects (aged 59-90 years) from the ADNI 
cohort. Regression analysis was used to identify whether change in fourteen 
subregions, selected a priori, was associated with declining performance on 
memory tests from baseline to two-year follow-up. Percent thickness change in 
the right fusiform and inferior temporal cortices and expansion of the right 
inferior lateral ventricle were found to be significant predictors of subsequent 
decline on memory-specific neuropsychological measures. These results 
demonstrate that six-month regional neurodegeneration can be quantified in the 
healthy elderly and might help identify those at risk for subsequent cognitive 
decline.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that anxiety in amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI) increases rates of conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 
identify potential neural mechanisms underlying such an association.
METHODS: Participants (N = 376) with aMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were studied over a median period of 36 months. A 
Cox proportional-hazards model was used to assess the association between 
anxiety severity ratings on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and AD 
risk. Other variables were depression, memory loss, and MRI-derived AD-related 
regions of interest (ROIs), including hippocampal, amygdalar, entorhinal 
cortical (EC) volumes, and EC thickness, In addition, a linear regression model 
was used to determine the effect of anxiety in aMCI on rates of atrophy within 
ROIs.
RESULTS: Anxiety severity increased rate of aMCI conversion to AD, after 
controlling for depression and cognitive decline. The association between 
anxiety and AD remained significant even with inclusion of ROI baseline values 
or atrophy rates as explanatory variables. Further, anxiety status predicted 
greater rates of decrease in EC volume. An association between anxiety and EC 
thickness missed significance.
CONCLUSION: Anxiety symptoms in aMCI predict conversion to AD, over and beyond 
the effects of depression, memory loss, or atrophy within AD neuroimaging 
biomarkers. These findings, together with the greater EC atrophy rate predicted 
by anxiety, are compatible with the hypothesis that anxiety is not a prodromal 
noncognitive feature of AD but may accelerate decline toward AD through direct 
or indirect effects on EC.

A published predictor model in a single-site cohort study (questionable 
dementia, QD) that contained episodic verbal memory (SRT total recall), 
informant report of function (FAQ), and MRI measures was tested using logistic 
regression and ROC analyses with comparable measures in a second multisite 
cohort study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI). There were 126 
patients in QD and 282 patients in ADNI with MCI followed for 3 years. Within 
each sample, the differences in AUCs between the statistical models were very 
similar. Adding hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes to the model 
containing AVLT/SRT, FAQ, age and MMSE increased the area under the curve (AUC) 
in ADNI but not QD, with sensitivity increasing by 2% in ADNI and 2% in QD for a 
fixed specificity of 80%. Conversely, adding episodic verbal memory (SRT/AVLT) 
and FAQ to the model containing age, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), hippocampal 
and entorhinal cortex volumes increased the AUC in ADNI and QD, with sensitivity 
increasing by 17% in ADNI and 10% in QD for 80% specificity. The predictor 
models showed similar differences from each other in both studies, supporting 
independent validation. MRI hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes showed 
limited added predictive utility to memory and function measures.

Typically twin studies are used to investigate the aggregate effects of genetic 
and environmental influences on brain phenotypic measures. Although some 
phenotypic measures are highly heritable in twin studies, SNPs (single 
nucleotide polymorphisms) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
account for only a small fraction of the heritability of these measures. We 
mapped the genetic variation (the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by 
variation among SNPs) of volumes of pre-defined regions across the whole brain, 
as explained by 512,905 SNPs genotyped on 747 adult participants from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found that 85% of the 
variance of intracranial volume (ICV) (p = 0.04) was explained by considering 
all SNPs simultaneously, and after adjusting for ICV, total grey matter (GM) and 
white matter (WM) volumes had genetic variation estimates near zero (p = 0.5). 
We found varying estimates of genetic variation across 93 non-overlapping 
regions, with asymmetry in estimates between the left and right cerebral 
hemispheres. Several regions reported in previous studies to be related to 
Alzheimer's disease progression were estimated to have a large proportion of 
volumetric variance explained by the SNPs.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. A lack of 
curative treatments and a rapidly aging global population have amplified the 
need for early biomarkers of the disease process. Recent advances suggest that 
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be one of the earliest symptomatic 
markers of the AD cascade. Previous studies have identified changes in 
variability in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in patients with 
AD, with a possible association between BOLD variability and cerebrovascular 
factors in the aging brain. The objective of the current study was to determine 
whether changes in BOLD variability can be identified in individuals with SCD, 
and whether this signal may be associated with markers of cerebrovascular 
integrity in SCD and older adults without memory complaints. Method: Data were 
obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
from 19 participants with SCD and 19 similarly-aged controls. For each 
participant, a map of BOLD signal variability (SDBOLD) was computed as the 
standard deviation of the BOLD time-series at each voxel. Group comparisons were 
performed to examine differences in resting-state SDBOLD in SCD vs. healthy 
controls. Relationships were then examined between participant SDBOLD maps and 
neuroimaging markers of white matter vascular infarcts in each group separately. 
Results: Between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in 
whole-brain SDBOLD in individuals with SCD and controls. In the healthy aging 
group, higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden was associated with 
greater SDBOLD in right temporal regions (p < 0.05), and lower scores on a 
measure of global executive functioning. These associations were not identified 
in individuals with SCD. Conclusion: The current study underscores previous 
evidence for a relationship between SDBOLD and white matter vascular infarcts in 
the healthy aging brain. The findings also provide evidence for a dissociable 
relationship between healthy aging and SCD, such that in healthy controls, 
increased WMH is associated with declines in executive function that is not 
observed in older adults who present with memory complaints. Further multimodal 
work is needed to better understand the contributions of vascular pathology to 
the BOLD signal, and its potential relationship with pathological aging.

Cerebral atrophy rate is increasingly used as an outcome measure for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) trials. We used the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI) dataset to assess if adjusting for baseline characteristics can reduce 
sample sizes. Controls (n = 199), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
(n = 334) and AD (n = 144) had two MRI scans, 1-year apart; approximately 55% 
had baseline CSF tau, p-tau, and Abeta1-42. Whole brain (KN-BSI) and hippocampal 
(HMAPS-HBSI) atrophy rate, and ventricular expansion (VBSI) were calculated for 
each group; numbers required to power a placebo-controlled trial were estimated. 
Sample sizes per arm (80% power, 25% absolute rate reduction) for AD were (95% 
CI): brain atrophy = 81 (64,109), hippocampal atrophy = 88 (68,119), ventricular 
expansion = 118 (92,157); and for MCI: brain atrophy = 149 (122,188), 
hippocampal atrophy = 201 (160,262), ventricular expansion = 234 (191,295). To 
detect a 25% reduction relative to normal aging required increased sample sizes 
approximately 3-fold (AD), and approximately 5-fold (MCI). Disease severity and 
Abeta1-42 contributed significantly to atrophy rate variability. Adjusting for 
11 predefined covariates reduced sample sizes by up to 30%. Treatment trials in 
AD should consider the effects of normal aging; adjusting for baseline 
characteristics can significantly reduce required sample sizes.

Effects of T2-Weighted MRI Based Cranial Volume Measurements on Studies of the 
Aging Brain.

Vuong P, Drucker D, Schwarz C, Fletcher E, Decarli C, Carmichael O.

Many brain aging studies use total intracranial volume (TIV) as a proxy measure 
of premorbid brain size that is unaffected by neurodegeneration. T1-weighted 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences are commonly used to measure TIV, but 
T2-weighted MRI sequences provide superior contrast between the cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) bounding the premorbid brain space and surrounding dura mater. In 
this study, we compared T1-based and T2-based TIV measurements to assess the 
practical impact of this superior contrast on studies of brain aging. 810 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants, including 
healthy elders and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), received T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI at their baseline 
evaluation. TIV was automatically estimated from T1-weighted images using 
FreeSurfer version 4.3 (T1TIV), and an automated active contour method was used 
to estimate TIV from T2-weighted images (T2TIV). The correlation between T1TIV 
and T2TIV was high (.93), and disagreement was greater on larger heads. However, 
correcting a FreeSurfer-based measure of total parenchymal volume by dividing it 
by T2TIV led to stronger expected associations with a standardized measure of 
cognitive dysfunction (MMSE) in Poisson regression models among individuals with 
AD (z=1.73 vs. 1.09) and MCI (z=3.15 vs. 2.79) than a corresponding parenchymal 
volume measure divided by T1TIV. This effect was enhanced when the analysis was 
restricted to the cases where T1TIV and T2TIV disagreed the most. These findings 
suggest that T2-based TIV measurements may be higher fidelity than T1-based TIV 
measurements, thus leading to greater sensitivity to detect biologically 
plausible brain-behavior associations.

Decision-making systems trained on structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 
subjects affected by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (CTRL) 
are becoming widespread prognostic tools for subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). This study compares the performances of three classification 
methods based on support vector machines (SVMs), using as initial sets of brain 
voxels (ie, features): (1) the segmented grey matter (GM); (2) regions of 
interest (ROIs) by voxel-wise t-test filtering; (3) parceled ROIs, according to 
prior knowledge. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) is applied in all cases 
to investigate whether feature reduction improves the classification accuracy. 
We analyzed more than 600 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects, training 
the SVMs on the AD/CTRL dataset, and evaluating them on a trial MCI dataset. The 
classification performance, evaluated as the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), reaches AUC = (88.9 ± .5)% in 20-fold 
cross-validation on the AD/CTRL dataset, when the GM is classified as a whole. 
The highest discrimination accuracy between MCI converters and nonconverters is 
achieved when the SVM-RFE is applied to the whole GM: with AUC reaching (70.7 ± 
.9)%, it outperforms both ROI-based approaches in predicting the AD conversion.

BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease 
(AD) is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified 
AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been 
integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 
controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), 
we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p < 10-5). We then integrated these 
AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from 
a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard 
score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates 
and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of 
instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested 
replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on 
Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, 
individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age 
and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE ε3/3 individuals, the 
PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and 
highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 × 10-22). In 
independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC 
Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 × 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal 
aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 × 10-10), and was 
associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, 
p = 3.9 × 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease 
score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 × 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD 
neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 × 
10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 × 10-5). Additional prospective validation of 
these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is 
necessary before clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in 
age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic 
architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With 
thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove 
useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic 
trials.

Automated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) processing pipelines are 
gaining popularity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. They generate regional 
volumes, cortical thickness measures and other measures, which can be used as 
input for multivariate analysis. It is not clear which combination of measures 
and normalization approach are most useful for AD classification and to predict 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion. The current study includes MRI scans 
from 699 subjects [AD, MCI and controls (CTL)] from the Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The Freesurfer pipeline was used to generate 
regional volume, cortical thickness, gray matter volume, surface area, mean 
curvature, gaussian curvature, folding index and curvature index measures. 259 
variables were used for orthogonal partial least square to latent structures 
(OPLS) multivariate analysis. Normalisation approaches were explored and the 
optimal combination of measures determined. Results indicate that cortical 
thickness measures should not be normalized, while volumes should probably be 
normalized by intracranial volume (ICV). Combining regional cortical thickness 
measures (not normalized) with cortical and subcortical volumes (normalized with 
ICV) using OPLS gave a prediction accuracy of 91.5 % when distinguishing AD 
versus CTL. This model prospectively predicted future decline from MCI to AD 
with 75.9 % of converters correctly classified. Normalization strategy did not 
have a significant effect on the accuracies of multivariate models containing 
multiple MRI measures for this large dataset. The appropriate choice of input 
for multivariate analysis in AD and MCI is of great importance. The results 
support the use of un-normalised cortical thickness measures and volumes 
normalised by ICV.

Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic 
resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its 
structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are 
already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL)-based methods 
have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation 
tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework 
that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the 
deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with 
three main steps: (1) a U-Net-based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation, 
and (3) a second U-Net-based segmentation which uses both the original input 
data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on 
image data of three diagnostic groups [AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and controls] from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both 
intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared 
with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of 
context information (i.e., autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results 
suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in 
cross-cohort validation, i.e., when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied 
to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort 
validation, i.e., training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. 
Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape 
context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while 
keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.

With 90% of neuroscience clinical trials failing to see efficacy, there is a 
clear need for the development of disease biomarkers that can improve the 
ability to predict human Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial outcomes from animal 
studies. Several lines of evidence, including genetic susceptibility and disease 
studies, suggest the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) as a potential biomarker with congruency between humans and animal 
models. For example, early in AD, patients present with decreased glucose 
metabolism in the entorhinal cortex and several regions of the brain associated 
with disease pathology and cognitive decline. While several of the commonly used 
AD mouse models fail to show all the hallmarks of the disease or the limbic to 
cortical trajectory, there has not been a systematic evaluation of 
imaging-derived biomarkers across animal models of AD, contrary to what has been 
achieved in recent years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) (Miller, 2009). If animal AD models were found to mimic endpoints that 
correlate with the disease onset, progression, and relapse, then the 
identification of such markers in animal models could afford the field a 
translational tool to help bridge the preclinical-clinical gap. Using a 
combination of FDG-PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we 
examined the Tg2576 mouse for global and regional measures of brain glucose 
metabolism at 7 and 19 months of age. In experiment 1 we observed that at 
younger ages, when some plaque burden and cognitive deficits have been reported, 
Tg2576 mice showed hypermetabolism as assessed with FDG-PET. This 
hypermetabolism decreased with age to levels similar to wild type (WT) 
counterparts such that the 19-month-old transgenic (Tg) mice did not differ from 
age matched WTs. In experiment 2, using cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI, we 
demonstrated that the hypermetabolism observed in Tg mice at 7 months could not 
be explained by changes in hemodynamic parameters as no differences were 
observed when compared with WTs. Taken together, these data identify brain 
hypermetabolism in Tg2576 mice which cannot be accounted for by changes in 
vascular compliance. Instead, the hypermetabolism may reflect a neuronal 
compensatory mechanism. Our data are discussed in the context of disease 
biomarker identification and target validation, suggesting little or no utility

Ephrin type-A receptor 1 (EPHA1) (11771145) was documented to be one of the most 
strongly associated locus with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a recent 
meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies. However, its contribution 
to the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear to date. Here, we addressed the role 
of EPHA1 in AD by investigating the influence of EPHA1 on cerebrospinal fluid 
and neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical stages from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We did not detect significant 
association of EPHA1 with amyloid-β deposition or tau protein. However, the 
A-allele in the mild cognitive impairment group remarkably prevented hippocampal 
atrophy (partial correlation coefficient 2.812, 95% CI 0.651 to 4.973) at 
two-year follow-up. Additionally, AD subjects with the A-allele displayed less 
atrophy and greater cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in the right 
lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation coefficient 540.10, 
95% CI 247.26 to 832.95; CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.056, 95% CI 
0.024 to 0.087) and inferior temporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation 
coefficient 327.98, 95% CI 11.65 to 644.31; CMRgl: partial correlation 
coefficient 0.055, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.091) at baseline. This study suggests EPHA1 
(rs11771145) interferes with the pathological alteration of the hippocampus and 
the lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri throughout the AD 
process, leading to a lower risk of AD. However, the limited sample size and 
follow-up as well as the diversity across ethnicities precluded explanation of 
these findings.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied in the 
neuroimaging field to discover genetic variants associated with brain-related 
traits. So far, almost all GWASs conducted in neuroimaging genetics are 
performed on univariate quantitative features summarized from brain images. On 
the other hand, powerful deep learning technologies have dramatically improved 
our ability to classify images. In this study, we proposed and implemented a 
novel machine learning strategy for systematically identifying genetic variants 
that lead to detectable nuances on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). For a 
specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), if MRI images labeled by 
genotypes of this SNP can be reliably distinguished using machine learning, we 
then hypothesized that this SNP is likely to be associated with brain anatomy or 
function which is manifested in MRI brain images. We applied this strategy to a 
catalog of MRI image and genotype data collected by the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortium. From the results, we identified novel 
variants that show strong association to brain phenotypes.

Multi-centre data repositories like the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) offer a unique research platform, but pose questions 
concerning comparability of results when using a range of imaging protocols and 
data processing algorithms. The variability is mainly due to the 
non-quantitative character of the widely used structural T1-weighted magnetic 
resonance (MR) images. Although the stability of the main effect of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) on brain structure across platforms and field strength has been 
addressed in previous studies using multi-site MR images, there are only sparse 
empirically-based recommendations for processing and analysis of pooled 
multi-centre structural MR data acquired at different magnetic field strengths 
(MFS). Aiming to minimise potential systematic bias when using ADNI data we 
investigate the specific contributions of spatial registration strategies and 
the impact of MFS on voxel-based morphometry in AD. We perform a whole-brain 
analysis within the framework of Statistical Parametric Mapping, testing for 
main effects of various diffeomorphic spatial registration strategies, of MFS 
and their interaction with disease status. Beyond the confirmation of medial 
temporal lobe volume loss in AD, we detect a significant impact of spatial 
registration strategy on estimation of AD related atrophy. Additionally, we 
report a significant effect of MFS on the assessment of brain anatomy (i) in the 
cerebellum, (ii) the precentral gyrus and (iii) the thalamus bilaterally, 
showing no interaction with the disease status. We provide empirical evidence in 
support of pooling data in multi-centre VBM studies irrespective of disease 
status or MFS.

Automatic anatomical segmentation of magnetic resonance human brain images has 
been shown to be accurate and robust when based on multiple atlases that 
encompass the anatomical variability of the cohort of subjects. We observed that 
the method tends to fail when the segmentation target shows ventricular 
enlargement that is not captured by the atlas database. By incorporating tissue 
classification information into the image registration process, we aimed to 
increase the robustness of the method. For testing, subjects who participated in 
the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging (OPTIMA) and the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were selected for ventriculomegaly. 
Segmentation quality was substantially improved in the ventricles and 
surrounding structures (9/9 successes on visual rating versus 4/9 successes 
using the baseline method). In addition, the modification resulted in a 
significant increase of segmentation accuracy in healthy subjects' brain images. 
Hippocampal segmentation results in a group of patients with temporal lobe 
epilepsy were near identical with both approaches. The modified approach (MAPER, 
multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration) extends the applicability of 
multi-atlas based automatic whole-brain segmentation to subjects with 
ventriculomegaly, as seen in normal aging as well as in numerous 
neurodegenerative diseases.

We used longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to determine whether 
there are any gender differences in grey matter atrophy patterns over time in 
197 individuals with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 266 with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), compared with 224 healthy controls 
participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). While 
previous research has differentiated probable AD and aMCI groups from controls 
in brain atrophy, it is unclear whether and how sex plays a role in patterns of 
change over time. Using regional volumetric maps, we fit longitudinal models to 
the grey matter data collected at repeated occasions, seeking differences in 
patterns of volume change over time by sex and diagnostic group in a voxel-wise 
analysis. Additionally, using a region-of-interest approach, we fit longitudinal 
models to the global volumetric data of predetermined brain regions to determine 
whether this more conventional approach is sufficient for determining sex and 
group differences in atrophy. Our longitudinal analyses revealed that, of the 
various grey matter regions investigated, males and females in the AD group and 
the aMCI group showed different patterns of decline over time compared to 
controls in the bilateral precuneus, bilateral caudate nucleus, right entorhinal 
gyrus, bilateral thalamus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left insula, and 
right amygdala. As one of the first investigation to model more than two time 
points of structural MRI data over time, our findings add insight into how AD 
and aMCI males and females differ from controls and from each other over time.

Recently, several pattern recognition methods have been proposed to 
automatically discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimer's disease 
using different imaging modalities: sMRI, fMRI, PET and SPECT. Classical 
approaches in visual information retrieval have been successfully used for 
analysis of structural MRI brain images. In this paper, we use the visual 
indexing framework and pattern recognition analysis based on structural MRI data 
to discriminate three classes of subjects: normal controls (NC), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The approach uses the circular 
harmonic functions (CHFs) to extract local features from the most involved areas 
in the disease: hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in each slice 
in all three brain projections. The features are quantized using the 
Bag-of-Visual-Words approach to build one signature by brain (subject). This 
yields a transformation of a full 3D image of brain ROIs into a 1D signature, a 
histogram of quantized features. To reduce the dimensionality of the signature, 
we use the PCA technique. Support vector machines classifiers are then applied 
to classify groups. The experiments were conducted on a subset of ADNI dataset 
and applied to the "Bordeaux-3City" dataset. The results showed that our 
approach achieves respectively for ADNI dataset and "Bordeaux-3City" dataset; 
for AD vs NC classification, an accuracy of 83.77% and 78%, a specificity of 
88.2% and 80.4% and a sensitivity of 79.09% and 74.7%. For NC vs MCI 
classification we achieved for the ADNI datasets an accuracy of 69.45%, a 
specificity of 74.8% and a sensitivity of 62.52%. For the most challenging 
classification task (AD vs MCI), we reached an accuracy of 62.07%, a specificity 
of 75.15% and a sensitivity of 49.02%. The use of PCC visual features 
description improves classification results by more than 5% compared to the use 
of hippocampus features only. Our approach is automatic, less time-consuming and 
does not require the intervention of the clinician during the disease diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) dementia, particularly in patients with DLB and concomitant AD 
pathology (DLB/AD+), can be challenging and there is no specific MRI signature 
for DLB. The aim of this study is to examine the additional value of MRI-based 
brain volumetry in separating patients with DLB (AD+/-) from patients with AD 
and controls.
METHODS: We included 1518 participants from four cohorts (ADC, ADNI, PDBP and 
PredictND); 147 were patients with DLB (n = 76, DLB/AD+; n = 71, DLB/AD-), 668 
patients with AD dementia, and 703 controls. We used an automatic segmentation 
tool to compute volumes of 70 brain regions, for which age, sex, and head 
size-dependent z-scores were calculated. We compared individual regions between 
the diagnostic groups and evaluated whether combining multiple regions improves 
differentiation. To assess the diagnostic performance, we used the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity.
RESULTS: The classifier using the combination of 70 volumetric brain regions 
correctly classified 60% of patients with DLB and 70% of patients with AD 
dementia. For DLB vs. AD, the classifier produced an AUC of 0.80 (0.77-0.83), 
which outperformed the best individual region, hippocampus (AUC: 0.73 
[0.69-0.76], p < 0.01). For the comparison of DLB/AD+ vs. AD, the classifier 
increased the AUC to 0.74 (0.68-0.80), which was 0.70 (0.64-0.76) for the 
hippocampus, p = 0.25.
CONCLUSION: Using a combination of volumetric brain regions improved the 
classification accuracy, and thus the discrimination, of patients with DLB with 
and without concomitant AD pathology and AD.
KEY POINTS: Question No specific MRI signature for dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) exists, making the differential diagnosis challenging, especially with 
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Findings Volumes of individual brain 
regions defined by automatic MRI segmentation differed between DLB and AD 
patients and controls. Clinical relevance Automatic MRI segmentation can 
contribute to improving the discrimination of patients with DLB and AD, 
especially in non-specialized memory clinics.

Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, 
present as low burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their 
effectiveness in diagnosis of Alzheimer's or predicting its trajectory is still 
unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive 
assessments provide for identifying those at high risk for cognitive decline. We 
analyzed >500 ADNI participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive 
assessment and Aβ/tau PET scans, examining their ability to distinguish 
cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. Performance on the digital 
cognitive assessment were superior to both cortical Aβ and entorhinal tau in 
detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic 
discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting 
decline and future tau accumulation. Digital assessments are effective in 
identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools 
for early Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.

The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is declarative memory loss, but 
deficits in semantic fluency are also observed. We assessed how semantic fluency 
relates to cortical atrophy to identify specific regions that play a role in the 
loss of access to semantic information. Whole-brain structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed from 9 Normal Control (NC)(M=76.7, 
SD=5.6), 40 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (M=74.4, SD=8.6), and 10 probable AD 
(M=72.4, SD=8.0) subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). They all were administered the Category Fluency (CF) animals and 
vegetables tests. Poorer semantic fluency was associated with bilateral cortical 
atrophy of the inferior parietal lobule (Brodman areas (BA) 39 and 40) and BA 6, 
8, and 9 in the frontal lobe, as well as BA 22 in the temporal lobe. More 
diffuse frontal associations were seen in the left hemisphere involving BA 9, 
10, 32, 44, 45, and 46. Additional cortical atrophy was seen in the 
temporoparietal (BA 37) and the right parastriate (BA 19, 18) cortices. 
Associations were more diffuse for performance on vegetable fluency than animal 
fluency. The permutation-corrected map-wise significance for CF animals was 
pcorrected=0.01 for the left hemisphere, and pcorrected=0.06 for the right 
hemisphere. The permutation-corrected map-wise significance for CF vegetables 
was pcorrected=0.009 for the left hemisphere, and pcorrected=0.03 for the right 
hemisphere. These results demonstrate the profound effect of cortical atrophy on 
semantic fluency. Specifically, tapping into semantic knowledge involves the 
frontal lobe in addition to the language cortices of the temporoparietal region.

Measurement of brain change due to neurodegenerative disease and treatment is 
one of the fundamental tasks of neuroimaging. Deformation-based morphometry 
(DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive tool for estimating 
the change in the volume of brain regions over time. This paper demonstrates 
that a straightforward application of DBM to estimate the change in the volume 
of the hippocampus can result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of 
the rate of change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested 
as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and 12 month 
rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed by applying DBM to 
repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same day. This bias appears to be the 
result of asymmetry in the interpolation of baseline and followup images during 
longitudinal image registration. Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free 
atrophy estimation.

Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common brain disease in older 
adults with a clinical course that is similar to Alzheimer's disease. Four 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have previously shown association with 
HS-Aging. The present study investigated structural brain changes associated 
with these SNPs using surface-based analysis. Participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI; n = 1,239), with both MRI scans 
and genotype data, were used to assess the association between brain atrophy and 
previously identified HS-Aging risk SNPs in the following genes: GRN, TMEM106B, 
ABCC9, and KCNMB2 (minor allele frequency for each is >30%). A fifth SNP (near 
the ABCC9 gene) was evaluated in post-hoc analysis. The GRN risk SNP (rs5848_T) 
was associated with a pattern of atrophy in the dorsomedial frontal lobes 
bilaterally, remarkable since GRN is a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia. 
The ABCC9 risk SNP (rs704180_A) was associated with multifocal atrophy whereas a 
SNP (rs7488080_A) nearby (∼50 kb upstream) ABCC9 was associated with atrophy in 
the right entorhinal cortex. Neither TMEM106B (rs1990622_T), KCNMB2 
(rs9637454_A), nor any of the non-risk alleles were associated with brain 
atrophy. When all four previously identified HS-Aging risk SNPs were summed into 
a polygenic risk score, there was a pattern of associated multifocal brain 
atrophy in a predominately frontal pattern. We conclude that common SNPs 
previously linked to HS-Aging pathology were associated with a distinct pattern 
of anterior cortical atrophy. Genetic variation associated with HS-Aging 
pathology may represent a non-Alzheimer's disease contribution to atrophy 
outside of the hippocampus in older adults.

Hippocampal volumetry derived from structural MRI is increasingly used to 
delineate regions of interest for functional measurements, assess efficacy in 
therapeutic trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been endorsed by the new 
AD diagnostic guidelines as a radiological marker of disease progression. 
Unfortunately, morphological heterogeneity in AD can prevent accurate 
demarcation of the hippocampus. Recent developments in automated volumetry 
commonly use multi-template fusion driven by expert manual labels, enabling 
highly accurate and reproducible segmentation in disease and healthy subjects. 
However, there are several protocols to define the hippocampus anatomically in 
vivo, and the method used to generate atlases may impact automatic accuracy and 
sensitivity - particularly in pathologically heterogeneous samples. Here we 
report a fully automated segmentation technique that provides a robust platform 
to directly evaluate both technical and biomarker performance in AD among 
anatomically unique labeling protocols. For the first time we test head-to-head 
the performance of five common hippocampal labeling protocols for multi-atlas 
based segmentation, using both the Sunnybrook Longitudinal Dementia Study and 
the entire Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) baseline and 
24-month dataset. We based these atlas libraries on the protocols of (Haller et 
al., 1997; Killiany et al., 1993; Malykhin et al., 2007; Pantel et al., 2000; 
Pruessner et al., 2000), and a single operator performed all manual tracings to 
generate de facto "ground truth" labels. All methods distinguished between 
normal elders, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD in the expected 
directions, and showed comparable correlations with measures of episodic memory 
performance. Only more inclusive protocols distinguished between stable MCI and 
MCI-to-AD converters, and had slightly better associations with episodic memory. 
Moreover, we demonstrate that protocols including more posterior anatomy and 
dorsal white matter compartments furnish the best voxel-overlap accuracies (Dice 
Similarity Coefficient=0.87-0.89), compared to expert manual tracings, and 
achieve the smallest sample sizes required to power clinical trials in MCI and 
AD. The greatest distribution of errors was localized to the caudal hippocampus 
and the alveus-fimbria compartment when these regions were excluded. The 
definition of the medial body did not significantly alter accuracy among more 
comprehensive protocols. Voxel-overlap accuracies between automatic and manual 
labels were lower for the more pathologically heterogeneous Sunnybrook study in 
comparison to the ADNI-1 sample. Finally, accuracy among protocols appears to 
significantly differ the most in AD subjects compared to MCI and normal elders. 
Together, these results suggest that selection of a candidate protocol for fully 
automatic multi-template based segmentation in AD can influence both 
segmentation accuracy when compared to expert manual labels and performance as a 
biomarker in MCI and AD.

Ideal biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) should correlate with accepted 
measures of pathology in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); they should also 
correlate with, or predict, future clinical decline, and should be readily 
measured in hundreds to thousands of subjects. Here we explored the utility of 
automated 3D maps of the lateral ventricles as a possible biomarker of AD. We 
used our multi-atlas fluid image alignment (MAFIA) method, to compute 
ventricular models automatically, without user intervention, from 804 brain MRI 
scans with 184 AD, 391 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 229 healthy elderly 
controls (446 men, 338 women; age: 75.50 +/- 6.81 [SD] years). Radial expansion 
of the ventricles, computed pointwise, was strongly correlated with current 
cognition, depression ratings, Hachinski Ischemic scores, language scores, and 
with future clinical decline after controlling for any effects of age, gender, 
and educational level. In statistical maps ranked by effect sizes, ventricular 
differences were highly correlated with CSF measures of Abeta(1-42), and 
correlated with ApoE4 genotype. These statistical maps are highly automated, and 
offer a promising biomarker of AD for large-scale studies.

Recent studies found the variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene PLD3 
were associated with cognitive function, but its detailed mechanism before 
typical AD onset was unknown. Our current study examined the impact of PLD3 
common variant rs11667768 on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total-tau and 
phosphorylated-tau levels and structural MRI from the ADNI database. We found 
rs11667768 was significantly associated with CSF total-tau levels and 
hippocampal volumes at baseline and six-year follow-up in the total non-demented 
elderly group and the mild cognitive impairment subgroup, indicating a potential 
role of PLD3 common variants in influencing cognitive function through changing 
CSF total-tau levels and hippocampal volumes.

Patterns of brain atrophy measured by magnetic resonance structural imaging have 
been utilized as significant biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, brain atrophy is variable across patients and is non-specific for 
AD in general. Thus, automatic methods for AD classification require a large 
number of structural data due to complex and variable patterns of brain atrophy. 
In this paper, we propose an incremental method for AD classification using 
cortical thickness data. We represent the cortical thickness data of a subject 
in terms of their spatial frequency components, employing the manifold harmonic 
transform. The basis functions for this transform are obtained from the 
eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which are dependent only on the 
geometry of a cortical surface but not on the cortical thickness defined on it. 
This facilitates individual subject classification based on incremental 
learning. In general, methods based on region-wise features poorly reflect the 
detailed spatial variation of cortical thickness, and those based on vertex-wise 
features are sensitive to noise. Adopting a vertex-wise cortical thickness 
representation, our method can still achieve robustness to noise by filtering 
out high frequency components of the cortical thickness data while reflecting 
their spatial variation. This compromise leads to high accuracy in AD 
classification. We utilized MR volumes provided by Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to validate the performance of the method. Our 
method discriminated AD patients from Healthy Control (HC) subjects with 82% 
sensitivity and 93% specificity. It also discriminated Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) patients, who converted to AD within 18 months, from non-converted MCI 
subjects with 63% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Moreover, it showed that the 
entorhinal cortex was the most discriminative region for classification, which 
is consistent with previous pathological findings. In comparison with other 
classification methods, our method demonstrated high classification performance 
in both categories, which supports the discriminative power of our method in 
both AD diagnosis and AD prediction.

Recently, a large meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies (GWAS) 
identified a novel locus (rs2718058) adjacent to NME8 that played a preventive 
role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this link between the single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058 and the pathology of AD have not been 
mentioned yet. Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association 
between the NME8 rs2718058 genotypes and AD-related measures including the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, tau, P-tau concentrations, neuroimaging 
biomarkers and cognitive performance, in a large cohort from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used information of a total of 719 
individuals, including 211 normal cognition (NC), 346 mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and 162 AD. Although we didn't observe a positive relationship between 
rs2718058 and AD, it was significantly associated with several AD related 
endophenotypes. Among the normal cognitively normal participants, the minor 
allele G carriers showed significantly associated with higher CDRSB score than A 
allele carriers (P = 0.021). Occipital gyrus atrophy were significantly 
associated with NME8 genotype status (P = 0.002), with A allele carriers has 
more atrophy than the minor allele G carriers in AD patients; lateral ventricle 
(both right and left) cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) were 
significantly associated with NME8 genotype (P < 0.05), with GA genotype had 
higher metabolism than GG and AA genotypes in MCI group; the atrophic right 
hippocampus in 18 months is significantly different between the three group, 
with GG and AA genotypes had more hippocampus atrophy than GA genotypes in the 
whole group. Together, our results are consistent with the direction of previous 
research, suggesting that NME8 rs2718058 appears to play a role in lowering the 
brain neurodegeneration.

Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the first stages of the pathology is an 
important task to accelerate the development of new therapies and improve 
treatment. Compared to AD detection, the prediction of AD using structural MRI 
at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or pre-MCI stage is more complex because 
the associated anatomical changes are more subtle. In this study, we analyzed 
the capability of a recently proposed method, SNIPE (Scoring by Nonlocal Image 
Patch Estimator), to predict AD by analyzing entorhinal cortex (EC) and 
hippocampus (HC) scoring over the entire ADNI database (834 scans). Detection 
(AD vs. CN) and prediction (progressive - pMCI vs. stable - sMCI) efficiency of 
SNIPE were studied using volumetric and grading biomarkers. First, our results 
indicate that grading-based biomarkers are more relevant for prediction than 
volume-based biomarkers. Second, we show that HC-based biomarkers are more 
important than EC-based biomarkers for prediction. Third, we demonstrate that 
the results obtained by SNIPE are similar to or better than results obtained in 
an independent study using HC volume, cortical thickness, and tensor-based 
morphometry, individually and in combination. Fourth, a comparison of new 
patch-based methods shows that the nonlocal redundancy strategy involved in 
SNIPE obtained similar results to a new local sparse-based approach. Finally, we 
present the first results of patch-based morphometry to illustrate the 
progression of the pathology.

Resting-state functional connectivity is one promising biomarker for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it is still not known 
how accurately network analysis identifies AD and MCI across multiple sites. In 
this study, we examined whether resting-state functional connectivity data from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) could identify patients 
with AD and MCI at our site. We implemented an index based on the functional 
connectivity frequency distribution and compared performance for AD and MCI 
identification with multivoxel pattern analysis. The multivoxel pattern analysis 
using a connectivity map of the default mode network showed good performance, 
with an accuracy of 81.9% for AD and MCI identification within the ADNI, but the 
classification model obtained from the ADNI failed to classify AD, MCI, and 
healthy elderly adults from our site, with an accuracy of only 43.1%. In 
contrast, a functional connectivity index of the medial temporal lobe based on 
the frequency distribution showed moderate performance, with an accuracy of 
76.5-80.3% for AD identification within the ADNI. The performance of this index 
was similar for our data, with an accuracy of 73.9-82.6%. The frequency 
distribution-based index of functional connectivity could be a good biomarker 
for AD across multiple sites.

BACKGROUND: MRI-based hippocampus volume is a core clinical biomarker for 
identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To assess robustness of automatic hippocampus volumetry with the 
freely available FSL-FIRST software with respect to short-term repeat and across 
field strength imaging. FSL-FIRST hippocampus volume (FIRST-HV) was also 
evaluated as enrichment biomarker for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) trials.
METHODS: Robustness of FIRST-HV was assessed in 51 healthy controls (HC), 74 MCI 
subjects, and 28 patients with AD dementia from ADNI1, each with two pairs of 
back-to-back scans, one at 1.5T one at 3T. Enrichment performance was tested in 
a second sample of 287 ADNI MCI subjects.
RESULTS: FSL-FIRST worked properly in all four scans in 147 out of 153 subjects 
of the first sample (49 HC, 72 MCI, 26 AD). In these subjects, FIRST-HV did not 
differ between the first and the second scan within an imaging session, neither 
at 1.5T nor at 3T (p≥0.302). FIRST-HV was on average 0.78% larger at 3T compared 
to 1.5T (p = 0.012). The variance of the FIRST-HV difference was larger in the 
inter-field strength setting than in the intra-scanner settings (p < 0.0005). 
Computer simulations suggested that the additional variability encountered in 
the inter-field strength scenario does not cause a relevant degradation of 
FIRST-HV's prognostic performance in MCI. FIRST-HV based enrichment resulted in 
considerably increased effect size of the 2-years change of cognitive measures.
CONCLUSION: The impact of intra-scanner test-retest and inter-field strength 
variability of FIRST-HV on clinical tasks is negligible. In addition, FIRST-HV 
is useful for enrichment in clinical MCI trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia (accounting for 60% 
to 80%) and is the fifth leading cause of death for those people who are 65 or 
older. By 2050, one new case of AD in United States is expected to develop every 
33 sec. Unfortunately, there is no available effective treatment that can stop 
or slow the death of neurons that causes AD symptoms. On the other hand, it is 
widely believed that AD starts before development of the associated symptoms, so 
its prestages, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even significant 
memory concern (SMC), have received increasing attention, not only because of 
their potential as a precursor of AD, but also as a possible predictor of 
conversion to other neurodegenerative diseases. Although these prestages have 
been defined clinically, accurate/efficient diagnosis is still challenging. 
Moreover, brain functional abnormalities behind those alterations and 
conversions are still unclear. In this article, by developing novel sparse 
representations of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging signals and by using the most updated Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we successfully identified multiple functional 
components simultaneously, and which potentially represent those intrinsic 
functional networks involved in the resting-state activities. Interestingly, 
these identified functional components contain all the resting-state networks 
obtained from traditional independent-component analysis. Moreover, by using the 
features derived from those functional components, it yields high classification 
accuracy for both AD (94%) and MCI (92%) versus normal controls. Even for SMC we 
can still have 92% accuracy.

While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady degeneration over 
relatively long timelines, it is widely believed that the early stages are the 
most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible neuronal loss 
occurs. Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease 
progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, 
obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal 
databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of 
validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational 
methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a 
disease progression score (DPS), using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a 
neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the publicly available AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database, yielding an Alzheimer's DPS or ADPS score for each subject and 
each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker 
changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest 
biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of 
the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in 
the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The 
proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their 
state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common 
behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases 
in elderly and the incidence of this disease is increasing with older ages. One 
of the hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ) in human 
brains. Most of prior brain imaging researchers used the clinical symptom based 
diagnosis without the confirmation of imaging or fluid Aβ information. In this 
work, we study hippocampus morphometry on a cohort consisting of Aβ positive AD 
(N = 151) and matched Aβ negative cognitively unimpaired subjects (N = 271) with 
Aβ positivity determined via florbetapir PET. The brain images are obtained from 
publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We 
compute our surface multivariate morphometry statistics from segmented 
hippocampus structure in structural MR images. With these features, we find 
statistically significant difference by using Hotelling's T2 tests. Meanwhile, 
we apply a patch-based analysis of sparse coding system for binary group 
classification and achieve an accuracy rate of 90.48%. Our results demonstrate 
that our surface multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) perform better than 
traditional hippocampal volume measures in classification and it may be applied 
as a potential biomarker for distinguishing dementia due to AD from age matched 
normal aging individuals.

We introduce a new method for brain MRI segmentation, called the auto context 
model (ACM), to segment the hippocampus automatically in 3D T1-weighted 
structural brain MRI scans of subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). In a training phase, our algorithm used 21 hand-labeled 
segmentations to learn a classification rule for hippocampal versus 
non-hippocampal regions using a modified AdaBoost method, based on approximately 
18,000 features (image intensity, position, image curvatures, image gradients, 
tissue classification maps of gray/white matter and CSF, and mean, standard 
deviation, and Haar filters of size 1x1x1 to 7x7x7). We linearly registered all 
brains to a standard template to devise a basic shape prior to capture the 
global shape of the hippocampus, defined as the pointwise summation of all the 
training masks. We also included curvature, gradient, mean, standard deviation, 
and Haar filters of the shape prior and the tissue classified images as 
features. During each iteration of ACM - our extension of AdaBoost - the 
Bayesian posterior distribution of the labeling was fed back in as an input, 
along with its neighborhood features as new features for AdaBoost to use. In 
validation studies, we compared our results with hand-labeled segmentations by 
two experts. Using a leave-one-out approach and standard overlap and distance 
error metrics, our automated segmentations agreed well with human raters; any 
differences were comparable to differences between trained human raters. Our 
error metrics compare favorably with those previously reported for other 
automated hippocampal segmentations, suggesting the utility of the approach for 
large-scale studies.

A comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) has validated the 
identification of the Plexin-A 4 (PLXNA4) gene as a novel susceptibility factor 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, the precise role of PLXNA4 gene 
polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of AD remains to be established. 
Consequently, this study is aimed at exploring the relationship between PLXNA4 
gene polymorphisms and neuroimaging phenotypes intimately linked to AD. This 
study encompassed 812 subjects with PLXNA4 genotype data, procured from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Employing a tagging 
strategy, we identified five common variant sites within the PLXNA4 gene and 
assessed their associations with glucose metabolism, atrophy in AD-related brain 
regions (including the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and parahippocampal 
gyrus), and intracerebral Aβ deposition. We conducted a comprehensive analysis 
using a multiple linear regression model, with neuroimaging phenotypes as the 
dependent variable and PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms as the independent variable 
while incorporating APOE e4 carrier status, education level, age, and gender as 
covariates. The subjects were stratified into three groups based on their 
disease status: the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group, the mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) group, and the cognitively normal healthy control (CN) group. 
Within each group, we examined the associations between PLXNA4 gene 
polymorphisms and various neuroimaging phenotypes. Our study identified 
significant associations between the rs156676-A and rs78036292-G alleles and the 
baseline volumes of the anterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus, 
respectively, across the entire population. After 1 year of follow-up, a 
significant correlation was observed between the rs6467431-G allele and 
accelerated volumetric atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus in the overall 
population. Additionally, at the 2-year follow-up, significant correlations were 
observed between three PLXNA4 loci (rs1863015, rs6467431, rs67468325) and 
volumetric atrophy in the anterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and 
hippocampus across the entire population. Specifically, the rs1863015-G allele 
notably accelerated atrophy of the left middle temporal gyrus and bilateral 
hippocampus, whereas the A alleles of rs6467431 and rs67468325 markedly 
accelerated atrophy specifically in the bilateral hippocampus. Subgroup analysis 
further validated these findings. Additionally, in the baseline CN group, the 
rs78036292 allele showed a significant correlation with intracerebral Aβ 
deposition, while in the 2-year follow-up CN group, rs67468325 was significantly 
associated with alterations in glucose metabolism rates in the right cingulate 
gyrus. Our findings indicate that PLXNA4 genotypes may modulate the development 
of AD through their regulation of intracerebral Aβ deposition. Additionally, 
PLXNA4 genotypes are strongly associated with AD-related brain atrophy and 
glucose metabolism, suggesting that they may alter susceptibility to AD by 
modulating neurodegenerative biomarkers.

surface conformal parameterization by holomorphic 1-forms, inverse consistent 
surface fluid registration, and multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM). 
First, we conformally map a surface onto a planar rectangle space with 
holomorphic 1-forms. Second, we compute surface conformal representation by 
combining its local conformal factor and mean curvature and linearly scale the 
dynamic range of the conformal representation to form the feature image of the 
surface. Third, we align the feature image with a chosen template image via the 
fluid image registration algorithm, which has been extended into the curvilinear 
coordinates to adjust for the distortion introduced by surface parameterization. 
The inverse consistent image registration algorithm is also incorporated in the 
system to jointly estimate the forward and inverse transformations between the 
study and template images. This alignment induces a corresponding deformation on 
the surface. We tested the system on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) baseline dataset to study AD symptoms on hippocampus. In our system, by 
modeling a hippocampus as a 3D parametric surface, we nonlinearly registered 
each surface with a selected template surface. Then we used mTBM to analyze the 
morphometry difference between diagnostic groups. Experimental results show that 
the new system has better performance than two publicly available subcortical 
surface registration tools: FIRST and SPHARM. We also analyzed the genetic 
influence of the Apolipoprotein E[element of]4 allele (ApoE4), which is 
considered as the most prevalent risk factor for AD. Our work successfully 
detected statistically significant difference between ApoE4 carriers and 
non-carriers in both patients of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy 
control subjects. The results show evidence that the ApoE genotype may be 
associated with accelerated brain atrophy so that our work provides a new MRI 
analysis tool that may help presymptomatic AD research.

We propose a new method to maximize biomarker efficiency for detecting 
anatomical change over time in serial MRI. Drug trials using neuroimaging become 
prohibitively costly if vast numbers of subjects must be assessed, so it is 
vital to develop efficient measures of brain change. A popular measure of 
efficiency is the minimal sample size (n80) needed to detect 25% change in a 
biomarker, with 95% confidence and 80% power. For multivariate measures of brain 
change, we can directly optimize n80 based on a Linear Discriminant Analysis 
(LDA). Here we use a supervised learning framework to optimize n80, offering two 
alternative solutions. With a new medial surface modeling method, we track 3D 
dynamic changes in the lateral ventricles in 2065 ADNI scans. We apply our 
LDA-based weighting to the results. Our best average n80-in two-fold nested 
cross-validation-is 104 MCI subjects (95% CI: [94,139]) for a 1-year drug trial, 
and 75AD subjects [64,102]. This compares favorably with other MRI analysis 
methods. The standard "statistical ROI" approach applied to the same ventricular 
surfaces requires 165 MCI or 94AD subjects. At 2 years, the best LDA measure 
needs only 67 MCI and 52AD subjects, versus 119 MCI and 80AD subjects for the 
stat-ROI method. Our surface-based measures are unbiased: they give no 
artifactual additive atrophy over three time points. Our results suggest that 
statistical weighting may boost efficiency of drug trials that use brain maps.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes 
dementia. While molecular basis of AD is not fully understood, genetic factors 
are expected to participate in the development and progression of the disease. 
Our goal was to uncover novel genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease with 
a bioinformatics approach that accounts for tissue specificity.
FINDINGS: We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for hippocampal 
volume in two Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We 
used these GWAS in a subsequent tissue-specific network-wide association study 
(NetWAS), which applied nominally significant associations in the initial GWAS 
to identify disease relevant patterns in a functional network for the 
hippocampus. We compared prioritized gene lists from NetWAS and GWAS with 
literature curated AD-associated genes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in 
Man (OMIM) database. In the ADNI-1 GWAS, where we also observed an enrichment of 
low p-values, NetWAS prioritized disease-gene associations in accordance with 
OMIM annotations. This was not observed in the ADNI-2 dataset. We provide source 
code to replicate these analyses as well as complete results under permissive 
licenses.
CONCLUSIONS: We performed the first analysis of hippocampal volume using NetWAS, 
which uses machine learning algorithms applied to tissue-specific functional 
interaction network to prioritize GWAS results. Our findings support the idea 
that tissue-specific networks may provide helpful context for understanding the 
etiology of common human diseases and reveal challenges that network-based 
approaches encounter in some datasets. Our source code and intermediate results 
files can facilitate the development of methods to address these challenges.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is the most prevalent genetic risk factor 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal volumes are generally smaller in AD 
patients carrying the e4 allele compared to e4 noncarriers. Here we examined the 
effect of APOE e4 on hippocampal morphometry in a large imaging database-the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We automatically segmented 
and constructed hippocampal surfaces from the baseline MR images of 725 subjects 
with known APOE genotype information including 167 with AD, 354 with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 204 normal controls. High-order correspondences 
between hippocampal surfaces were enforced across subjects with a novel inverse 
consistent surface fluid registration method. Multivariate statistics consisting 
of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance were 
computed for surface deformation analysis. Using Hotelling's T(2) test, we found 
significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 carriers relative to 
noncarriers in the entire cohort as well as in the nondemented (pooled MCI and 
control) subjects, affecting the left hippocampus more than the right, and this 
effect was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. Our findings 
are consistent with previous studies that showed e4 carriers exhibit accelerated 
hippocampal atrophy; we extend these findings to a novel measure of hippocampal 
morphometry. Hippocampal morphometry has significant potential as an imaging 
biomarker of early stage AD.

PURPOSE: To assess the extent to which multiple Alzheimer disease (AD) 
biomarkers improve the ability to predict future decline in subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with predictions based on clinical 
parameters alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All protocols were approved by the institutional review 
board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 
The study was HIPAA compliant. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and fluorine 18 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) studies for 97 
subjects with MCI were used. MR imaging-derived gray matter probability maps and 
FDG PET images were analyzed by using independent component analysis, an 
unbiased data-driven method to extract independent sources of information from 
whole-brain data. The loading parameters for all MR imaging and FDG components, 
along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, were entered into logistic 
regression models (dependent variable: conversion to AD within 4 years). Eight 
models were considered, including all combinations of MR imaging, PET, and CSF 
markers with the covariates (age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score).
RESULTS: Combining MR imaging, FDG PET, and CSF data with routine clinical tests 
significantly increased the accuracy of predicting conversion to AD compared 
with clinical testing alone. The misclassification rate decreased from 41.3% to 
28.4% (P < .00001). FDG PET contributed more information to routine tests (P < 
.00001) than CSF (P = .32) or MR imaging (P = .08).
CONCLUSION: Imaging and CSF biomarkers can improve prediction of conversion from 
MCI to AD compared with baseline clinical testing. FDG PET appears to add the 
greatest prognostic information.

Proposal of a new tractographic feature for analysis of white matter in 
Alzheimer diffusion mr images.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia in elderly adults. In 
this, the white matter (WM) tracts in brain are disintegrated leading to loss of 
important cognitive functionality. Recent analysis have shown that early 
diagnosis of AD is still a challenging task. Although several reports are 
available, tractography remains the most promising and clinically relevant 
method for in-vivo study of WM tracts. In tractography, continuous WM pathways 
are reconstructed from voxel based models of discrete fiber orientation 
generated using diffusion tensor images. In this work an attempt has been made 
to classify AD using average length of tracts, a significant feature extracted 
from tractographic brain maps. The diffusion weighted images for AD and matched 
controls were obtained from ADNI, an international open access repository for 
Alzheimer's study. Data from equal number of AD and controls were used for this 
study. Fiber tracking was performed for the whole brain using tract based 
spatial statistics algorithm. ICBM Mori Labels 1 atlas provided in the Network 
Analysis option of ExploreDTI was used to divide the WM into 48 anatomical 
regions. Classification was performed using random forest, random tree and 
decision stumps, and their performance indices were compared. The results show 
that all the classifiers are able to classify AD and controls using the 
extracted feature. An accuracy of 78.4% is obtained using decision stumps. 
Random forest and random tree provide an increased accuracy of 96% and 97% 
respectively. The precision and recall is also found to be higher for random 
forest and random tree as compared to decision stumps. These results suggest 
that random forest and random tree are suitable for classification of AD and 
controls using average tract length as a feature. In this paper, the 
introduction, objectives, materials and methods, results and discussions and 
conclusions are presented in detail.

There are growing numbers of studies using machine learning approaches to 
characterize patterns of anatomical difference discernible from neuroimaging 
data. The high-dimensionality of image data often raises a concern that feature 
selection is needed to obtain optimal accuracy. Among previous studies, mostly 
using fixed sample sizes, some show greater predictive accuracies with feature 
selection, whereas others do not. In this study, we compared four common feature 
selection methods. 1) Pre-selected region of interests (ROIs) that are based on 
prior knowledge. 2) Univariate t-test filtering. 3) Recursive feature 
elimination (RFE), and 4) t-test filtering constrained by ROIs. The predictive 
accuracies achieved from different sample sizes, with and without feature 
selection, were compared statistically. To demonstrate the effect, we used grey 
matter segmented from the T1-weighted anatomical scans collected by the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as the input features to a 
linear support vector machine classifier. The objective was to characterize the 
patterns of difference between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and cognitively 
normal subjects, and also to characterize the difference between mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) patients and normal subjects. In addition, we also compared the 
classification accuracies between MCI patients who converted to AD and MCI 
patients who did not convert within the period of 12 months. Predictive 
accuracies from two data-driven feature selection methods (t-test filtering and 
RFE) were no better than those achieved using whole brain data. We showed that 
we could achieve the most accurate characterizations by using prior knowledge of 
where to expect neurodegeneration (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). 
Therefore, feature selection does improve the classification accuracies, but it 
depends on the method adopted. In general, larger sample sizes yielded higher 
accuracies with less advantage obtained by using knowledge from the existing 
literature.

Many brain morphometry studies have been performed in order to characterize the 
brain atrophy pattern of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The earliest studies focused 
on the volume of particular brain structures, such as hippocampus and entorhinal 
cortex. Even though volumetry is a powerful, robust and intuitive technique that 
has yielded a wealth of findings, more complex shape descriptors have been used 
to perform statistical shape analysis of particular brain structures. However, 
in shape analysis studies of brain structures the information of the relative 
pose between neighbor structures is typically disregarded. This work presents a 
framework to analyse pose information including the following approaches: 
similarity transformations with either pseudo-Riemannian or left-invariant 
Riemannian metric, and centered transformations with a bi-invariant Riemannian 
metric. As an illustration, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a 
discrimination analysis were performed on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) data.

Recently, several high dimensional classification methods have been proposed to 
automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls (CN) based on T1-weighted 
MRI. However, these methods were assessed on different populations, making it 
difficult to compare their performance. In this paper, we evaluated the 
performance of ten approaches (five voxel-based methods, three methods based on 
cortical thickness and two methods based on the hippocampus) using 509 subjects 
from the ADNI database. Three classification experiments were performed: CN vs 
AD, CN vs MCIc (MCI who had converted to AD within 18 months, MCI converters - 
MCIc) and MCIc vs MCInc (MCI who had not converted to AD within 18 months, MCI 
non-converters - MCInc). Data from 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 39 MCIc and 69 AD were used 
for training and hyperparameters optimization. The remaining independent samples 
of 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 37 MCIc and 68 AD were used to obtain an unbiased estimate 
of the performance of the methods. For AD vs CN, whole-brain methods 
(voxel-based or cortical thickness-based) achieved high accuracies (up to 81% 
sensitivity and 95% specificity). For the detection of prodromal AD (CN vs 
MCIc), the sensitivity was substantially lower. For the prediction of 
conversion, no classifier obtained significantly better results than chance. We 
also compared the results obtained using the DARTEL registration to that using 
SPM5 unified segmentation. DARTEL significantly improved six out of 20 
classification experiments and led to lower results in only two cases. Overall, 
the use of feature selection did not improve the performance but substantially 
increased the computation times.

Structural changes in neuroanatomical subregions can be measured using serial 
magnetic resonance imaging scans, and provide powerful biomarkers for detecting 
and monitoring Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) has made a large database of longitudinal scans available, 
with one of its primary goals being to explore the utility of structural change 
measures for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials of putative 
disease-modifying therapies. Several ADNI-funded research laboratories have 
calculated such measures from the ADNI database and made their results publicly 
available. Here, using sample size estimates, we present a comparative analysis 
of the overall results that come from the application of each laboratory's 
extensive processing stream to the ADNI database. Obtaining accurate measures of 
change requires correcting for potential bias due to the measurement methods 
themselves; and obtaining realistic sample size estimates for treatment 
response, based on longitudinal imaging measures from natural history studies 
such as ADNI, requires calibrating measured change in patient cohorts with 
respect to longitudinal anatomical changes inherent to normal aging. We present 
results showing that significant longitudinal change is present in healthy 
control subjects who test negative for amyloid-β pathology. Therefore, sample 
size estimates as commonly reported from power calculations based on total 
structural change in patients, rather than change in patients relative to change 
in healthy controls, are likely to be unrealistically low for treatments 
targeting amyloid-related pathology. Of all the measures publicly available in 
ADNI, thinning of the entorhinal cortex quantified with the Quarc methodology 
provides the most powerful change biomarker.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 genotype is a powerful risk factor for late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort, we previously reported significant baseline structural 
differences in APOE e4 carriers relative to non-carriers, involving the left 
hippocampus more than the right--a difference more pronounced in e4 homozygotes 
than heterozygotes. We now examine the longitudinal effects of APOE genotype on 
hippocampal morphometry at 6-, 12- and 24-months, in the ADNI cohort. We 
employed a new automated surface registration system based on conformal geometry 
and tensor-based morphometry. Among different hippocampal surfaces, we computed 
high-order correspondences, using a novel inverse-consistent surface-based fluid 
registration method and multivariate statistics consisting of multivariate 
tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance. At each time point, using 
Hotelling's T(2) test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 
carriers relative to non-carriers in the full cohort as well as in the 
non-demented (pooled MCI and control) subjects at each follow-up interval. In 
the complete ADNI cohort, we found greater atrophy of the left hippocampus than 
the right, and this asymmetry was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than 
heterozygotes. These findings, combined with our earlier investigations, 
demonstrate an e4 dose effect on accelerated hippocampal atrophy, and support 
the enrichment of prevention trial cohorts with e4 carriers.

Neuroimage analysis based on machine learning technologies has been widely 
employed to assist the diagnosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease 
and its prodromal stage--mild cognitive impairment. One of the major problems in 
brain image analysis involves learning the most relevant features from a huge 
set of raw imaging features, which are far more numerous than the training 
samples. This makes the tasks of both disease classification and interpretation 
extremely challenging. Sparse coding via L1 regularization, such as Lasso, can 
provide an effective way to select the most relevant features for alleviating 
the curse of dimensionality and achieving more accurate classification. However, 
the selected features may distribute randomly throughout the whole brain, 
although in reality disease-induced abnormal changes often happen in a few 
contiguous regions. To address this issue, we investigate a tree-guided sparse 
coding method to identify grouped imaging features in the brain regions for 
guiding disease classification and interpretation. Spatial relationships of the 
image structures are imposed during sparse coding with a tree-guided 
regularization. Our experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that the 
tree-guided sparse coding method not only achieves better classification 
accuracy, but also allows for more meaningful diagnosis of brain diseases 
compared with the conventional L1-regularized LASSO.

Understanding the time-dependent changes of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is a key to assessing disease progression and measuring the 
outcomes of disease-modifying therapies. In this article, we validate an AD 
progression score model which uses multiple biomarkers to quantify the AD 
progression of subjects following 3 assumptions: (1) there is a unique disease 
progression for all subjects; (2) each subject has a different age of onset and 
rate of progression; and (3) each biomarker is sigmoidal as a function of 
disease progression. Fitting the parameters of this model is a challenging 
problem which we approach using an alternating least squares optimization 
algorithm. To validate this optimization scheme under realistic conditions, we 
use the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. With the help of 
Monte Carlo simulations, we show that most of the global parameters of the model 
are tightly estimated, thus enabling an ordering of the biomarkers that fit the 
model well, ordered as: the Rey auditory verbal learning test with 30 minutes 
delay, the sum of the 2 lateral hippocampal volumes divided by the intracranial 
volume, followed (by the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes score and the 
mini-mental state examination score) in no particular order and at last the AD 
assessment scale-cognitive subscale.

Manual segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MR) is the gold standard 
for evaluating hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, 
different segmentation protocols provide up to 2.5-fold volume differences. Here 
we surveyed the most frequently used segmentation protocols in the AD literature 
as a preliminary step for international harmonization. The anatomical landmarks 
(anteriormost and posteriormost slices, superior, inferior, medial, and lateral 
borders) were identified from 12 published protocols for hippocampal manual 
segmentation ([Abbreviation] first author, publication year: [B] Bartzokis, 
1998; [C] Convit, 1997; [dTM] deToledo-Morrell, 2004; [H] Haller, 1997; [J] 
Jack, 1994; [K] Killiany, 1993; [L] Lehericy, 1994; [M] Malykhin, 2007; [Pa] 
Pantel, 2000; [Pr] Pruessner, 2000; [S] Soininen, 1994; [W] Watson, 1992). The 
hippocampi of one healthy control and one AD patient taken from the 1.5T MR ADNI 
database were segmented by a single rater according to each protocol. The 
accuracy of the protocols' interpretation and translation into practice was 
checked with lead authors of protocols through individual interactive web 
conferences. Semantically harmonized landmarks and differences were then 
extracted, regarding: (a) the posteriormost slice, protocol [B] being the most 
restrictive, and [H, M, Pa, Pr, S] the most inclusive; (b) inclusion [C, dTM, J, 
L, M, Pr, W] or exclusion [B, H, K, Pa, S] of alveus/fimbria; (c) separation 
from the parahippocampal gyrus, [C] being the most restrictive, [B, dTM, H, J, 
Pa, S] the most inclusive. There were no substantial differences in the 
definition of the anteriormost slice. This survey will allow us to 
operationalize differences among protocols into tracing units, measure their 
impact on the repeatability and diagnostic accuracy of manual hippocampal 
segmentation, and finally develop a harmonized protocol.

In this paper, we present a new metric combining regional measurements to 
improve image based population studies that use manifold learning techniques. 
These studies currently rely on a single score over the whole brain image 
domain. Thus, they require large amount of training data to uncover spatially 
complex variation in the whole brain impacted by diseases. We reduce the impact 
of this issue by first computing pairwise measurements in local regions 
separately and then combining regional measurements into a single pairwise 
metric. We apply the new metric to learn the manifold of ADNI data and evaluate 
the resulting morphological representation by fitting multiple linear regression 
models to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. The regression models 
show that the morphological representations from the proposed metric achieves 
higher estimation accuracy of MMSE score compared to those from the conventional 
global scores.

There is an urgent need for neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
that correlate with cognitive decline, and with accepted measures of pathology 
detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ideal biomarkers should also be able to 
predict future decline, and should be computable automatically from hundreds to 
thousands of images without user intervention. Here we used our multi-atlas 
fluid image alignment method (MAFIA [1]), to automatically segment parametric 3D 
surface models of the lateral ventricles in brain MRI scans from 184 AD, 391 
MCI, and 229 healthy elderly controls. Radial expansion of the ventricles, 
computed pointwise, was correlated with measures of (1) clinical decline, (2) 
pathology from CSF, and (3) future deterioration. Surface-based correlation maps 
were assessed using a cumulative distribution function method to rank 
influential covariates according to their effect sizes. The resulting approach 
is highly automated, and boosts the power of fluid image registration by 
integrating multiple independent registrations to reduce segmentation errors.

The hippocampus is widely studied with neuroimaging techniques given its 
importance in learning and memory and its potential as a biomarker for brain 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. However, its complex folding 
anatomy often presents analytical challenges. In particular, the critical 
hippocampal subfield information is usually ignored by hippocampal registration 
in detailed morphometric studies. Such an approach is thus inadequate to 
accurately characterize hippocampal morphometry and effectively identify 
hippocampal structural changes related to different conditions. To bridge this 
gap, we present our initial effort towards building a computational framework 
for subfield-guided hippocampal morphometry. This initial effort is focused on 
surface-based morphometry and aims to build a surface atlas of hippocampal 
subfields. Using the FreeSurfer software package, we obtain valuable hippocampal 
subfield information. Using the FIRST software package, we extract reliable 
hippocampal surface information. Using SPHARM, we develop an approach to create 
an atlas by mapping interpolated subfield information onto an average surface. 
The empirical result using ADNI data demonstrates the promise and good 
reproducibility of the proposed method.

Getting volume change of hippocampus by segmenting on brain MRI is an important 
step in the diagnose of Alzheimer's disease and other brain disease. Three 
dimensional segmentation can make use of the correlation of image in gray and 
spatial position, so it has high accuracy. This paper proposes a novel 
three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model combined with the surface evolution of 
deformable model and taking the prior information as an external force term to 
constrain the evolution of three dimensional surfaces. In order to solve the 
problem of high computational cost caused by 3D segmentation, the 
parallelization of the method is programmed on single GPU platform and dual GPU 
platform. Comparison experiments were set to test the accuracy of segmentation 
and computational efficiency between the novel LB method and another method by 
using 20 real AD patient's MRI from ADNI. In ensuring the accuracy of the 
segmentation, the time can be reduced to 12.76 s on single GPU platform, and 
17.32 s on dual GPU platform, contrasting 132.43 s on CPU platform. It fully 
validates the characteristics of lattice Boltzmann method which can be highly 
parallelized.

The genetic basis of resilience, defined as better cognitive functioning than 
predicted based on neuroimaging or neuropathology, is not well understood. Our 
objective was to identify genetic variation associated with executive 
functioning resilience. We computed residuals from regression models of 
executive functioning, adjusting for age, sex, education, Hachinski score, and 
MRI findings (lacunes, cortical thickness, volumes of white matter 
hyperintensities and hippocampus). We estimated heritability and analyzed these 
residuals in models for each SNP. We further evaluated our most promising SNP 
result by evaluating cis-associations with brain levels of nearby (±100 kb) 
genes from a companion data set, and comparing expression levels in cortex and 
cerebellum from decedents with AD with those from other non-AD diseases. 
Complete data were available for 750 ADNI participants of European descent. 
Executive functioning resilience was highly heritable (H² = 0.76; S.E. = 0.44). 
rs3748348 on chromosome 14 in the region of RNASE13 was associated with 
executive functioning resilience (p-value = 4.31 × 10⁻⁷). rs3748348 is in strong 
linkage disequilibrium (D' of 1.00 and 0.96) with SNPs that map to TPPP2, a 
member of the α-synuclein family of proteins. We identified nominally 
significant associations between rs3748348 and expression levels of three genes 
(FLJ10357, RNASE2, and NDRG2). The strongest association was for FLJ10357 in 
cortex, which also had the most significant difference in expression between AD 
and non-AD brains, with greater expression in cortex of decedents with AD 
(p-value = 7 × 10⁻⁷). Further research is warranted to determine whether this 
signal can be replicated and whether other loci may be associated with cognitive 
resilience.

Most current research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on transverse 
measurements. Given the nature of neurodegeneration in AD progression, observing 
longitudinal changes in the structural features of brain networks over time may 
improve the accuracy of the predicted transformation and provide a good measure 
of the progression of AD. Currently, there is no cure for patients with existing 
AD dementia, but patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the prodromal 
stage of AD dementia may be diagnosed. The study of the early diagnosis of MCI 
and the prediction of MCI to AD transformation is of great significance for the 
monitoring of the MCI to AD transformation process. Despite the high rate of MCI 
conversion to AD, the neuropathological cause of MCI is heterogeneous. However, 
many people with MCI remain stable. Treatment options are different for patients 
with stable MCI and those with underlying dementia. Therefore, it is of great 
significance for clinical practice to predict whether patients with MCI will 
develop AD dementia. This paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on 
a convolution neural network (CNN) with residuals combined with multi-layer long 
short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose AD and predict MCI. Firstly, multi-time 
resting-state fMRI images were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for preprocessing, and then an AAL brain 
partition template was used to construct a 90 × 90 functional connectivity (FC) 
network matrix of a whole-brain region of interest (ROI). Secondly, the 
diversity of training samples was increased by generating an adversarial network 
(GAN). Finally, a CNN with residuals and a multi-layer LSTM model were 
constructed to automatically classify and predict the functional adjacency 
matrix. This method can not only distinguish Alzheimer's disease from normal 
health conditions at multiple time points, but can also predict progressive MCI 
(pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI) at multiple time points. The classification 
accuracies in AD vs. NC and sMCI vs.pMCI reached 93.5% and 75.5%, respectively.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequently observed, irreversible brain function 
disorder among elderly individuals. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (rs-fMRI) has been introduced as an alternative approach to assessing 
brain functional abnormalities in AD patients. However, alterations in the brain 
rs-fMRI signal complexities in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients 
remain unclear. Here, we described the novel application of permutation entropy 
(PE) to investigate the abnormal complexity of rs-fMRI signals in MCI and AD 
patients. The rs-fMRI signals of 30 normal controls (NCs), 33 early MCI (EMCI), 
32 late MCI (LMCI), and 29 AD patients were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. After preprocessing, 
whole-brain entropy maps of the four groups were extracted and subjected to 
Gaussian smoothing. We performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the 
brain entropy maps of the four groups. The results after adjusting for age and 
sex differences together revealed that the patients with AD exhibited lower 
complexity than did the MCI and NC controls. We found five clusters that 
exhibited significant differences and were distributed primarily in the 
occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes. The average PE of the five clusters 
exhibited a decreasing trend from MCI to AD. The AD group exhibited the least 
complexity. Additionally, the average PE of the five clusters was significantly 
positively correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and 
significantly negatively correlated with Functional Assessment Questionnaire 
(FAQ) scores and global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores in the patient 
groups. Significant correlations were also found between the PE and regional 
homogeneity (ReHo) in the patient groups. These results indicated that declines 
in PE might be related to changes in regional functional homogeneity in AD. 
These findings suggested that complexity analyses using PE in rs-fMRI signals

BACKGROUND: Blood adiponectin and leptin are adipokines that emerged as 
potential biomarkers for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to their 
strong connection with obesity. Although obesity affects the relation between 
beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and cognitive decline, the longitudinal 
interactive effect of adipokines and Aβ on cognition and brain structures in 
humans remains unexplored. Hence, we investigated whether plasma levels of 
adiponectin and leptin are associated with future cognitive decline and cortical 
thinning across Aβ conditions (Aβ [+] and Aβ [-]) in individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Of 156 participants with MCI from the longitudinal cohort study of 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 31 were Aβ (-) and 125 were 
Aβ (+) as determined by CSF analysis. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores and the thickness of the 
parahippocampal and entorhinal cortices were used to evaluate cognition and 
brain structure, respectively. After stratifying groups by Aβ conditions, the 
association of cognitive and brain structural changes with baseline plasma 
levels of adiponectin and leptin was examined.
RESULTS: Of the total 156 participants, 51 were women (32.7%). The mean age of 
participants was 74.5 (standard deviation 7.57), and the mean follow-up period 
was 54.3 months, without a difference between the Aβ (+) and (-) groups. After 
adjustment for confounders, higher plasma adiponectin levels were associated 
with a faster increase in ADAS-Cog scores, indicating faster cognitive decline 
under the Aβ (+) condition (beta = 0.224, p = 0.018). Likewise, participants 
with higher plasma adiponectin presented faster cortical thinning in the 
bilateral parahippocampal cortices under the Aβ (+) condition (beta = - 0.004, p 
= 0.012 for the right side; beta = - 0.004, p = 0.025 for the left side). 
Interestingly, plasma adiponectin levels were not associated with longitudinal 
ADAS-Cog scores or cortical thickness in the Aβ (-) condition. Plasma leptin 
levels were not predictive of cognition or cortical thickness regardless of Aβ 
status.
CONCLUSION: Plasma adiponectin can be a potential biomarker for predicting the 
speed of AD progression in individuals with Aβ (+) MCI.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cortical atrophy and disrupted 
anatomic connectivity, and leads to abnormal interactions between neural 
systems. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and graph theory can be used to 
evaluate major brain networks and detect signs of a breakdown in network 
connectivity. In a longitudinal study using both DWI and standard magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), we assessed baseline white-matter connectivity patterns 
in 30 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, mean age 71.8 ± 7.5 years, 
18 males and 12 females) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 
Using both standard MRI-based cortical parcellations and whole-brain 
tractography, we computed baseline connectivity maps from which we calculated 
global "small-world" architecture measures, including mean clustering 
coefficient and characteristic path length. We evaluated whether these baseline 
network measures predicted future volumetric brain atrophy in MCI subjects, who 
are at risk for developing AD, as determined by 3-dimensional Jacobian 
"expansion factor maps" between baseline and 6-month follow-up anatomic scans. 
This study suggests that DWI-based network measures may be a novel predictor of 
AD progression.

In Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), identifying a high risk of conversion to 
Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (AD) is a primary goal for patient management. 
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely employed to pursue data-driven 
diagnostic and prognostic goals. An agreement on the stability of these 
algorithms -when applied to different biomarkers and other conditions- is far 
from being reached. In this study, we compared the different prognostic 
performances of three supervised ML algorithms fed with multimodal biomarkers of 
MCI subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
algorithms predict MCI conversion to AD. They can also be simultaneously 
employed -with the voting procedure- to improve predictivity. AD prediction 
accuracy is influenced by the nature of the data (i.e., neuropsychological test 
scores, cerebrospinal fluid AD-related proteins and APOE ε4, cerebral structural 
MRI (sMRI) data). In our study, independent of the applied ML algorithms, sMRI 
data showed the lowest accuracy (0.79) compared to other classes. Multimodal 
data were helpful in the algorithms' performances by combining clinical and 
biological measures. Accordingly, using the three ML algorithms, the highest 
accuracy (0.90) was reached by employing neuropsychological and AD-related 
biomarkers. Finally, the feature selection procedure indicated that the most 
critical variables in the respective classes were the ADAS-Cog-13 scale, the 
medial temporal lobe and hippocampus atrophy, and the ratio between 
phosphorylated Tau and Aβ42 proteins. In conclusion, our data support the notion 
that using multiple ML algorithms and multimodal biomarkers helps make more 
accurate and solid predictions.

The probable-amnestic (Pr-a) mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-storage subtype is 
a phenotype with 8.5 times more risk of conversion to dementia, mainly 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), than the possible non-amnestic (Pss-na) MCI. The aim 
of this study was to find the optimized cognitive composites (CCs) domain scores 
most related to neuroimaging biomarkers within Pr-aMCI-storage subtype patients. 
The Fundació ACE (ACE) study with 20 Pr-aMCI-storage subtype subjects (MCI) were 
analyzed. All subjects underwent a neuropsychological assessment, a structural 
MRI, FDG-PET, and PIB-PET. The adjusted hippocampal volume (aHV) on MRI, the 
standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) on FDG-PET and PIB-PET SUVR measures were 
analyzed. The construction of the CCs domain scores, and the aHV on MRI and 
FDG-PET SUVR measures, were replicated in the parental AB255 study database 
(n = 133 MCI). Partial correlations adjusted by age, gender, and education were 
calculated with the associated p-value among every CC domain score and the 
neuroimaging biomarkers. The results were replicated in the "MCI due to AD" with 
memory storage impairments from ADNI. Delayed Recall CC domain score was 
significantly correlated with PIB-PET SUVR (β= -0.61, p = 0.003) in the ACE 
study and also with aHV on MRI (β= 0.27, p = 0.01) and FDG-PET SUVR (β= 0.27, 
p = 0.01) in the AB255 study. After a median survival time of 20.6 months, 85% 
from the ACE MCI converted to AD. The replication of our results in the ADNI 
dataset also confirmed our findings. Delayed Recall is the CC domain score best 
correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers associated with prodromal AD diagnosis.

Objective: It is well-known that the hippocampus presents significant asymmetry 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that difference in volumes between left and 
right exists and varies with disease progression. However, few works 
investigated whether the asymmetry degree of subfields of hippocampus changes 
through the continuum from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Thus, aim of 
the present work was to evaluate the Asymmetry Index (AI) of hippocampal 
substructures as possible MRI biomarkers of Dementia. Moreover, we aimed to 
assess whether the subfields presented peculiar differences between left and 
right hemispheres. We also investigated the relationship between the asymmetry 
magnitude in hippocampal subfields and the decline of verbal memory as assessed 
by Rey's auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). Methods: Four-hundred subjects 
were selected from ADNI, equally divided into healthy controls (HC), AD, stable 
MCI (sMCI), and progressive MCI (pMCI). The structural baseline T1s were 
processed with FreeSurfer 6.0 and volumes of whole hippocampus (WH) and 12 
subfields were extracted. The AI was calculated as: 
(|Left-Right|/(Left+Right))*100. ANCOVA was used for evaluating AI differences 
between diagnoses, while paired t-test was applied for assessing changes between 
left and right volumes, separately for each group. Partial correlation was 
performed for exploring relationship between RAVLT summary scores (Immediate, 
Learning, Forgetting, Percent Forgetting) and hippocampal substructures AI. The 
statistical threshold was Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05/13 = 0.0038. Results: We 
found a general trend of increased degree of asymmetry with increasing severity 
of diagnosis. Indeed, AD presented the higher magnitude of asymmetry compared 
with HC, sMCI and pMCI, in the WH (AI mean 5.13 ± 4.29 SD) and in each of its 
twelve subfields. Moreover, we found in AD a significant negative correlation (r 
= -0.33, p = 0.00065) between the AI of parasubiculum (mean 12.70 ± 9.59 SD) and 
the RAVLT Learning score (mean 1.70 ± 1.62 SD). Conclusions: Our findings showed 
that hippocampal subfields AI varies differently among the four groups HC, sMCI, 
pMCI, and AD. Moreover, we found-for the first time-that hippocampal 
substructures had different sub-patterns of lateralization compared with the 
whole hippocampus. Importantly, the severity in learning rate was correlated 
with pathological high degree of asymmetry in parasubiculum of AD patients.

Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene play an important role in the 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, the APOE ε4 allele is an 
established genetic risk factor for AD, while the APOE ε2 allele is a protective 
factor against AD. However, the mechanism underlying this impact of APOE 
genotype on the pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. This study sought to 
investigate the influence of APOE genotype on cognition and neuroimaging 
features in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals and patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 177 participants were selected from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 101 MCI 
patients and 76 CN individuals. A 2 × 3 (consisting of two groups and three APOE 
genotypes) analysis of covariance was carried out to measure the influences of 
diagnosis and APOE genotype on cognition and brain features, assessed based on 
global functional connectivity density (gFCD) and hippocampal volume. In 
addition, a mediation analysis was carried out to investigate the indirect 
influence of neuroimaging features on the relationship between APOE genotype and 
cognitive performance in the MCI group. This analysis revealed that APOE 
genotype had an influence on brain function in the bilateral precentral gyrus, 
right thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In addition, an 
interactive influence between diagnosis and APOE genotype was found on general 
cognition, immediate memory, executive function, hippocampal volume, and gFCD in 
the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). 
Finally, this mediation analysis revealed that hippocampal volume and gFCD in 
the thalamus may mediate the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive 
performance in the MCI group. Taken together, our findings provide novel 
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the genetically guided pathogenic 
mechanisms of AD.

BACKGROUND: The prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression from its 
early stages is a research priority. In this context, the use of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) in AD has experienced a notable surge in recent years. 
However, existing investigations predominantly concentrate on distinguishing 
clinical phenotypes through cross-sectional approaches. This study aims to 
investigate the potential of modeling additional dimensions of the disease, such 
as variations in brain metabolism assessed via [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET), and utilize this information to identify patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to dementia (pMCI).
METHODS: We analyzed data from 1,617 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had undergone at least one FDG-PET scan. We 
identified the brain regions with the most significant hypometabolism in AD and 
used Deep Learning (DL) models to predict future changes in brain metabolism. 
The best-performing model was then adapted under a multi-task learning framework 
to identify pMCI individuals. Finally, this model underwent further analysis 
using eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques.
RESULTS: Our results confirm a strong association between hypometabolism, 
disease progression, and cognitive decline. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
integrating data on changes in brain metabolism during training enhanced the 
models' ability to detect pMCI individuals (sensitivity=88.4%, 
specificity=86.9%). Lastly, the application of XAI techniques enabled us to 
delve into the brain regions with the most significant impact on model 
predictions, highlighting the importance of the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, 
and some subcortical structures.
CONCLUSION: This study introduces a novel dimension to predictive modeling in 
AD, emphasizing the importance of projecting variations in brain metabolism 
under a multi-task learning paradigm.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder requiring 
accurate and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Resting-state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and gray matter volume analysis from 
structural MRI have emerged as valuable tools for investigating AD-related brain 
alterations. However, the potential benefits of integrating these modalities 
using deep learning techniques remain unexplored. In this study, we propose a 
novel framework that fuses composite images of multiple rs-fMRI networks (called 
voxelwise intensity projection) and gray matter segmentation images through a 
deep learning approach for improved AD classification. We demonstrate the 
superiority of fMRI networks over commonly used metrics such as amplitude of 
low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF in capturing spatial maps 
critical for AD classification. We use a multi-channel convolutional neural 
network incorporating the AlexNet dropout architecture to effectively model 
spatial and temporal dependencies in the integrated data. Extensive experiments 
on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset of AD patients 
and cognitively normal (CN) validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing 
improved classification performance of 94.12% test accuracy and an area under 
the curve (AUC) score of 97.79 compared to existing methods. Our results show 
that the fusion results generally outperformed the unimodal results. The 
saliency visualizations also show significant differences in the hippocampus, 
amygdala, putamen, caudate nucleus, and regions of basal ganglia which are in 
line with the previous neurobiological literature. Our research offers a novel 
method to enhance our grasp of AD pathology. By integrating data from various 
functional networks with structural MRI insights, we significantly improve 
diagnostic accuracy. This accuracy is further boosted by the effective 
visualization of this combined information. This lays the groundwork for further 
studies focused on providing a more accurate and personalized approach to AD 
diagnosis. The proposed framework and insights gained from fMRI networks provide 
a promising avenue for future research in deep multimodal fusion and 
neuroimaging analysis.

BACKGROUND: Loss of autonomy in day-to-day functioning is one of the feared 
outcomes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and relatives may have been worried by 
subtle behavioral changes in ordinary life situations long before these changes 
are given medical attention. In the present study, we ask if such subtle changes 
should be given weight as an early predictor of a future AD diagnosis.
METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were used to define a group of adults with a mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) diagnosis remaining stable across several visits (sMCI, n=360; 55-91 years 
at baseline), and a group of adults who over time converted from having an MCI 
diagnosis to an AD diagnosis (cAD, n=320; 55-88 years at baseline). Eleven 
features were used as input in a Random Forest (RF) binary classifier (sMCI vs. 
cAD) model. This model was tested on an unseen holdout part of the dataset, and 
further explored by three different permutation-driven importance estimates and 
a comprehensive post hoc machine learning exploration.
RESULTS: The results consistently showed that measures of daily life 
functioning, verbal memory function, and a volume measure of hippocampus were 
the most important predictors of conversion from an MCI to an AD diagnosis. 
Results from the RF classification model showed a prediction accuracy of around 
70% in the test set. Importantly, the post hoc analyses showed that even subtle 
changes in everyday functioning noticed by a close informant put MCI patients at 
increased risk for being on a path toward the major cognitive impairment of an 
AD diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that even subtle changes in everyday functioning 
should be noticed when reported by relatives in a clinical evaluation of 
patients with MCI. Information of these changes should also be included in 
future longitudinal studies to investigate different pathways from normal 
cognitive aging to the cognitive decline characterizing different stages of AD 
and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Recent advances in multi-atlas based algorithms address many of the previous 
limitations in model-based and probabilistic segmentation methods. However, at 
the label fusion stage, a majority of algorithms focus primarily on optimizing 
weight-maps associated with the atlas library based on a theoretical objective 
function that approximates the segmentation error. In contrast, we propose a 
novel method-Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields 
(AWoL-MRF)-that aims at mimicking the sequential process of manual segmentation, 
which is the gold-standard for virtually all the segmentation methods. AWoL-MRF 
begins with a set of candidate labels generated by a multi-atlas segmentation 
pipeline as an initial label distribution and refines low confidence regions 
based on a localized Markov random field (L-MRF) model using a novel sequential 
inference process (walks). We show that AWoL-MRF produces state-of-the-art 
results with superior accuracy and robustness with a small atlas library 
compared to existing methods. We validate the proposed approach by performing 
hippocampal segmentations on three independent datasets: (1) Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Database (ADNI); (2) First Episode Psychosis patient cohort; and 
(3) A cohort of preterm neonates scanned early in life and at term-equivalent 
age. We assess the improvement in the performance qualitatively as well as 
quantitatively by comparing AWoL-MRF with majority vote, STAPLE, and Joint Label 
Fusion methods. AWoL-MRF reaches a maximum accuracy of 0.881 (dataset 1), 0.897 
(dataset 2), and 0.807 (dataset 3) based on Dice similarity coefficient metric, 
offering significant performance improvements with a smaller atlas library (< 
10) over compared methods. We also evaluate the diagnostic utility of AWoL-MRF 
by analyzing the volume differences per disease category in the ADNI1: Complete 
Screening dataset. We have made the source code for AWoL-MRF public at: 
https://github.com/CobraLab/AWoL-MRF.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. 
By the time an individual has been diagnosed with AD, it may be too late for 
potential disease modifying therapy to strongly influence outcome. Therefore, it 
is critical to develop better diagnostic tools that can recognize AD at early 
symptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic stages. Mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), introduced to describe a prodromal stage of AD, is presently classified 
into early and late stages (E-MCI, L-MCI) based on severity. Using a graph-based 
semi-supervised learning (SSL) method to integrate multimodal brain imaging data 
and select valid imaging-based predictors for optimizing prediction accuracy, we 
developed a model to differentiate E-MCI from healthy controls (HC) for early 
detection of AD. Multimodal brain imaging scans (MRI and PET) of 174 E-MCI and 
98 HC participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
cohort were used in this analysis. Mean targeted region-of-interest (ROI) values 
extracted from structural MRI (voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer V5) 
and PET (FDG and Florbetapir) scans were used as features. Our results show that 
the graph-based SSL classifiers outperformed support vector machines for this 
task and the best performance was obtained with 66.8% cross-validated AUC (area 
under the ROC curve) when FDG and FreeSurfer datasets were integrated. Valid 
imaging-based phenotypes selected from our approach included ROI values 
extracted from temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala. Employing a graph-based 
SSL approach with multimodal brain imaging data appears to have substantial 
potential for detecting E-MCI for early detection of prodromal AD warranting 
further investigation.

The hippocampus and amygdala are the first brain regions to show early signs of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. AD is preceded by a prodromal stage known as 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a crucial crossroad in the clinical progression 
of the disease. The topographical development of AD has been the subject of 
extended investigation. However, it is still largely unknown how the transition 
from MCI to AD affects specific hippocampal and amygdala subregions. The present 
study is set to answer that question. We analyzed data from 223 subjects: 75 
healthy controls, 52 individuals with MCI, and 96 AD patients obtained from the 
ADNI. The MCI group was further divided into two subgroups depending on whether 
individuals in the 48 months following the diagnosis either remained stable 
(N = 21) or progressed to AD (N = 31). A MANCOVA test evaluated group 
differences in the volume of distinct amygdala and hippocampal subregions 
obtained from magnetic resonance images. Subsequently, a stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) determined which combination of magnetic resonance 
imaging parameters was most effective in predicting the conversion from MCI to 
AD. The predictive performance was assessed through a Receiver Operating 
Characteristic analysis. AD patients displayed widespread subregional atrophy. 
MCI individuals who progressed to AD showed selective atrophy of the hippocampal 
subiculum and tail compared to stable MCI individuals, who were 
undistinguishable from healthy controls. Converter MCI showed atrophy of the 
amygdala's accessory basal, central, and cortical nuclei. The LDA identified the 
hippocampal subiculum and the amygdala's lateral and accessory basal nuclei as 
significant predictors of MCI conversion to AD. The analysis returned a 
sensitivity value of 0.78 and a specificity value of 0.62. These findings 
highlight the importance of targeted assessments of distinct amygdala and 
hippocampus subregions to help dissect the clinical and pathophysiological 
development of the MCI to AD transition.

This study aimed to build automated detection models-one by brain regional 
volume (V-model), and the other by radiomics features of the whole brain 
(R-model)-to differentiate mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from cognitive normal 
(CN), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The 
objectives are to compare the models and identify whether radiomics or volumetry 
can provide a better prediction for differentiating different types of dementia.
METHOD: 582 MRI T1-weighted images were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which is a multicenter operating open 
source database for AD. In total, 97 images of AD, 293 images of MCI patient and 
192 images of cognitive normal were divided into a training, a validation and a 
test group at a ratio of 70:15:15. For each T1-weighted image, volumetric 
segmentation was performed with the image analysis software FreeSurfer, and 
radiomics features were retrieved by imaging research software 3D slicers. Brain 
regional volume and radiomics features were used to build the V-model and 
R-model, respectively, using the random forest algorithm by R. The receiver 
operating characteristics (ROC) curve of both models were used to evaluate their 
diagnostic accuracy and reliability to differentiate AD, MCI and CN.
RESULTS: To differentiate MCI and CN, both V-model and R-model achieved 
excellent performance, with an AUC of 0.9992 ± 0.0022 and 0.9850 ± 0.0032, 
respectively. No significant difference was found between the two AUCs, 
indicating both models attained similar good performance. In MCI and AD 
differentiation, the V-model and R-model yielded AUC of 0.9986 ± 0.0013 and 
0.9714 ± 0.0175, respectively. The best performance was to differentiate AD from 
CN, where the V-model and R-model yielded AUC of 0.9994 ± 0.0019 and 0.9830 ± 
0.009, respectively. The results suggested that both volumetry and radiomics 
approaches could be used in differentiating AD, MCI and CN, based on T1 weighted 
MR images using random forest algorithm successfully.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the radiomics features from T1-weighted MR 
images achieved excellence performance in differentiating AD, MCI and CN. 
Compared to the volumetry method, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 
slightly lower in using radiomics, but still attained very good and reliable 
classification of the three stages of neurodegenerations. In view of the 
convenience and operator independence in feature extraction, radiomics can be a 
quantitative biomarker to differentiate the disease groups.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology reveals progressive 
microstructural alterations of cortical architecture. Recent studies reported 
intriguing biphasic trajectories of cortical structural changes in the early 
stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), comprising decreased mean diffusivity (MD) 
and increased cortical thickness in cognitively normal amyloid-positive 
individuals, ahead of increases and decreases, respectively, in subsequent 
disease stages.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand the cytoarchitectural correlates of these 
observations, we assessed novel cortical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics 
that are correlated with disruption of cortical minicolumns and protein 
deposition.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of whole brain and temporal 
lobe cortical diffusivity measures. Investigation of associations between 
baseline cortical diffusivity values and 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI 
changes. Investigations of the relationships between cortical diffusivity 
measures and biomarkers of neuroinflammation.
SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four amyloid-negative controls (CN-), 28 amyloid-positive 
controls (CN+), 46 amyloid-positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI+) and 22 amyloid-positive subjects with AD were included.
MEASUREMENTS: 3DT1 and DTI scans at baseline and approximately 24-month 
follow-up were used to calculate cortical MD and three novel cortical 
diffusivity measures: the angle between the radial minicolumnar axis and the 
principal diffusion direction (AngleR); the diffusion components perpendicular 
to the minicolumns (PerpPD+), and the principal diffusion component parallel 
with the minicolumns (ParlPD). Cortical macrostructural measurements (cortical 
volume fraction and cortical thickness), were used to test the hypothesis that 
baseline cortical diffusivity values can predict change in structural MRI 
outcomes over approximately 24 months. CSF soluble TREM2 and progranulin (PGRN) 
concentrations were used to investigate associations with microglial activity 
and potentially other aspects of neuroinflammation.
RESULTS: Cortical diffusivity metrics revealed a dependence on disease stage, 
with AngleR and PerpPD+ displaying biphasic relationships and ParlPD a monotonic 
relationship with clinical severity. The novel metrics were able to 
differentiate between Amyloid+ and Amyloid- controls (AngleR) and to 
differentiate among disease stages along the AD continuum (PerpPD+). Linear 
regression revealed significant associations between baseline cortical 
diffusivity values and subsequent 24-month longitudinal structural-MRI changes. 
AngleR values were significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 and PGRN 
concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical diffusivity parameters reflecting minicolumnar 
organization and neuroinflammation may provide a sensitive and biologically 
interpretable measurement of cortex quality and microstructure across the AD 
continuum.

INTRODUCTION: We present the Brain-Age Score (BAS) as a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)-based index for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed a fully 
automated framework for estimating the BAS in healthy controls (HCs) and 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD, using MRI scans.
METHODS: We trained the proposed framework using 385 HCs from the IXI and OASIS 
datasets and evaluated 146 HCs, 102 stable-MCI (sMCI), 112 progressive-MCI 
(pMCI), and 147 AD patients from the J-ADNI dataset. We used a correlation test 
to determine the association between the BAS and four traditional screening 
tools of AD: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Ratio 
(CDR), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score (ADAS), and Functional Assessment 
Questionnaire (FAQ). Furthermore, we assessed the association between BAS and 
anatomical MRI measurements: the normalized gray matter (nGM), normalized white 
matter (nWM), normalized cerebrospinal fluid (nCSF), mean cortical thickness as 
well as hippocampus volume.
RESULTS: The correlation results demonstrated that the BAS is in line with 
traditional screening tools of AD (i.e., the MMSE, CDR, ADAS, and FAQ scores) as 
well as anatomical MRI measurements (i.e., nGM, nCSF, mean cortical thickness, 
and hippocampus volume).
DISCUSSION: The BAS may be useful for diagnosing the brain atrophy level and can 
be a reliable automated index for clinical applications and neuropsychological 
screening tools.

An early intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly essential due to the 
fact that this neuro degenerative disease generates major life-threatening 
issues, especially memory loss among patients in society. Moreover, categorizing 
NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course 
allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is 
important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the 
patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we 
developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) 
classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI 
modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed 
framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI 
regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from 
the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. 
Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through 
Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN 
classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the 
training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This 
newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of 
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is 
carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our 
proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 
96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI. The 
experimental results suggest that the removal of noisy samples from the training 
data can enhance the decision generation process of the expert systems.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is a key outcome of clinical studies in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of global amyloid load as well as hippocampus 
and basal forebrain volumes on longitudinal rates and practice effects from 
repeated testing of domain specific cognitive change in the AD spectrum, 
considering non-linear effects and heterogeneity across cohorts.
METHODS: We included 1,514 cases from three cohorts, ADNI, AIBL, and DELCODE, 
spanning the range from cognitively normal people to people with subjective 
cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used generalized 
Bayesian mixed effects analysis of linear and polynomial models of amyloid and 
volume effects in time. Robustness of effects across cohorts was determined 
using Bayesian random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: We found a consistent effect of amyloid and hippocampus volume, but not 
of basal forebrain volume, on rates of memory change across the three cohorts in 
the meta-analysis. Effects for amyloid and volumetric markers on executive 
function were more heterogeneous. We found practice effects in memory and 
executive performance in amyloid negative cognitively normal controls and MCI 
cases, but only to a smaller degree in amyloid positive controls and not at all 
in amyloid positive MCI cases.
CONCLUSIONS: We found heterogeneity between cohorts, particularly in effects on 
executive functions. Initial increases in cognitive performance in amyloid 
negative, but not in amyloid positive MCI cases and controls may reflect 
practice effects from repeated testing that are lost with higher levels of 
cerebral amyloid.

The objective of this study was to assess the association of sex and the 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele with brain tau deposition and atrophy in older 
adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using quantitative 18F-AV-1451 positron 
emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: 
Preprocessed 18F-AV-1451 tau PET, raw T1-weighted structural MR images, 
demographic information, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) and 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements from 57 elderly individuals with AD were 
downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
An iteratively reblurred Van Cittert partial volume correction (PVC) method was 
applied to all preprocessed PET images. MRI images were used for PET spatial 
normalization and gray matter volume calculation. 18F-AV-1451 PET standardized 
uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated relative to the cerebellum gray matter. 
The effect of sex and APOE ε4 status on SUVR and gray matter volume were 
assessed at both region of interest (ROI) and voxelwise levels. Results: Female 
APOE ε4 carriers (FACs) had significant higher 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs in the lateral 
temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, medial temporal, inferior temporal, 
entorhinal cortex, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus regions, and exhibited 
smaller gray matter volumes in the posterior cingulate, medial temporal, 
inferior temporal and amygdala regions, as compared to the non-FACs (NFACs) 
comprised of female APOE ε4 non-carriers, male APOE ε4 carriers and male APOE ε4 
non-carriers. Voxelwise analysis revealed forebrain and limbic clusters with 
greater 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs and lower gray matter volume between FACs compared to 
the NFACs. Negative correlations between ROI 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs and gray matter 
volumes were significant after adjusting for age and years of education. 
Conclusions: Among elderly individuals with AD, sex modified the effects of the 
APOE ε4 allele on region-specific tau deposition and gray matter volume. FACs 
had elevated brain region-specific tau PET SUVR and decreased gray matter volume 
in comparison to NFACs. The study provides a basis for the use of precision 
medicine in the diagnosis of AD and evaluation of therapeutics using 18F-AV-1451 
PET and structural MRI.

Automatic segmentation of brain anatomy has been a key processing step in 
quantitative neuroimaging analyses. An extensive body of literature has relied 
on Freesurfer segmentations. Yet, in recent years, the multi-atlas segmentation 
framework has consistently obtained results with superior accuracy in various 
evaluations. We compared brain anatomy segmentations from Freesurfer, which uses 
a single probabilistic atlas strategy, against segmentations from Multi-atlas 
region Segmentation utilizing Ensembles of registration algorithms and 
parameters and locally optimal atlas selection (MUSE), one of the leading 
ensemble-based methods that calculates a consensus segmentation through fusion 
of anatomical labels from multiple atlases and registrations. The focus of our 
evaluation was twofold. First, using manual ground-truth hippocampus 
segmentations, we found that Freesurfer segmentations showed a bias towards 
over-segmentation of larger hippocampi, and under-segmentation in older age. 
This bias was more pronounced in Freesurfer-v5.3, which has been used in 
multiple previous studies of aging, while the effect was mitigated in more 
recent Freesurfer-v6.0, albeit still present. Second, we evaluated inter-scanner 
segmentation stability using same day scan pairs from ADNI acquired on 1.5T and 
3T scanners. We also found that MUSE obtains more consistent segmentations 
across scanners compared to Freesurfer, particularly in the deep structures.

We aim to better characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with 
suspected non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (SNAP) based on their 
longitudinal outcome, cognition, biofluid, and neuroimaging profile. MCI 
participants (n = 361) from ADNI-GO/2 were designated "amyloid positive" with 
abnormal amyloid-beta 42 levels (AMY+) and "neurodegeneration positive" (NEU+) 
with abnormal hippocampal volume or hypometabolism using 
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. SNAP was compared with the 
other MCI groups and with AMY- controls. AMY-NEU+/SNAP, 16.6%, were older than 
the NEU- groups but not AMY- controls. They had a lower conversion rate to AD 
after 24 months than AMY+NEU+ MCI participants. SNAP-MCI participants had 
similar amyloid-beta 42 levels, florbetapir and tau levels, but larger white 
matter hyperintensity volumes than AMY- controls and AMY-NEU- MCI participants. 
SNAP participants performed worse on all memory domains and on other cognitive 
domains, than AMY-NEU- participants but less so than AMY+NEU+ participants. 
Subthreshold levels of cerebral amyloidosis are unlikely to play a role in 
SNAP-MCI, but pathologies involving the hippocampus and cerebrovascular disease 
may underlie the neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in this group.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation have been 
independently linked to cognitive deficits in older adults at risk for dementia. 
Less is known about how CBF and Aβ may interact to affect cognition in 
cognitively normal older adults. Therefore, we examined potential statistical 
interactions between CBF and Aβ status in regions typically affected in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a sample of older adults from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Sixty-two cognitively normal 
participants (mean age = 72 years) underwent neuroimaging and memory testing. 
Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify CBF and 
florbetapir PET amyloid imaging was used to measure Aβ deposition. Aβ status 
(i.e., positivity versus negativity) was determined based on established cutoffs 
(Landau et al., 2013). The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was used to assess 
memory. Linear regression models adjusted for age, education, and sex, 
demonstrated significant interactions between CBF and Aβ status on memory 
performance. Among Aβ positive older adults, there were significant negative 
associations between higher CBF in hippocampus, posterior cingulate, and 
precuneus and poorer memory performance. In contrast, among Aβ negative older 
adults, there were no significant associations between CBF and cognition. Our 
findings extend previous CBF studies of dementia risk by reporting interactions 
between Aβ status and CBF on memory performance in a sample of 
well-characterized, cognitively normal older adults. Results suggest that 
differential CBF-cognition associations can be identified in healthy, 
asymptomatic Aβ positive older adults relative to Aβ negative individuals. 
Associations between higherCBF and poorer memory among Aβ positive older adults 
may reflect a cellular and/or vascular compensatory response to pathologic 
processes whereby higher CBF is needed to maintain normal memory abilities. 
Findings indicate that CBF and its associations with cognition may have utility 
as a reliable marker of brain function early in the AD process when 
interventions are likely to be beneficial.

Amyloid (Aβ) pathology is the earliest detectable pathophysiological event along 
the Alzheimer's continuum, which can be measured both in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) and by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Yet, these biomarkers identify 
two distinct Aβ pools, reflecting the clearance of soluble Aβ as opposed to the 
presence of Aβ fibrils in the brain. An open question is whether risk factors 
known to increase Alzheimer's' disease (AD) prevalence may promote an imbalance 
between soluble and deposited Aβ. Unveiling such interactions shall aid our 
understanding of the biological pathways underlying Aβ deposition and foster the 
design of effective prevention strategies. We assessed the impact of three major 
AD risk factors, such as age, APOE-ε4 and female sex, on the association between 
CSF and PET Aβ, in two independent samples of non-demented individuals (ALFA: 
n = 320, ADNI: n = 682). We tested our hypotheses both in candidate regions of 
interest and in the whole brain using voxel-wise non-parametric permutations. 
All of the assessed risk factors induced a higher Aβ deposition for any given 
level of CSF Aβ42/40, although in distinct cerebral topologies. While age and 
sex mapped onto neocortical areas, the effect of APOE-ε4 was prominent in the 
medial temporal lobe, which represents a target of early tau deposition. 
Further, we found that the effects of age and APOE-ε4 was stronger in women than 
in men. Our data indicate that specific AD risk factors affect the spatial 
patterns of cerebral Aβ aggregation, with APOE-ε4 possibly facilitating a 
co-localization between Aβ and tau along the disease continuum.

Current diagnostic systems for Alzheimer's disease (AD) rely upon clinical signs 
and symptoms, despite the fact that the multiplicity of clinical symptoms 
renders various neuropsychological assessments inadequate to reflect the 
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Since putative neuroimaging biomarkers 
play a crucial role in understanding the etiology of AD, we sought to stratify 
the diverse relationships between AD biomarkers and cognitive decline in the 
aging population and uncover risk factors contributing to the diversities in AD. 
To do so, we capitalized on a large amount of neuroimaging data from the ADNI 
study to examine the inflection points along the dynamic relationship between 
cognitive decline trajectories and whole-brain neuroimaging biomarkers, using a 
state-of-the-art statistical model of change point detection. Our findings 
indicated that the temporal relationship between AD biomarkers and cognitive 
decline may differ depending on the synergistic effect of genetic risk and 
biological sex. Specifically, tauopathy-PET biomarkers exhibit a more dynamic 
and age-dependent association with Mini-Mental State Examination scores 
(p<0.05), with inflection points at 72, 78, and 83 years old, compared with 
amyloid-PET and neurodegeneration (cortical thickness from MRI) biomarkers. In 
the landscape of health disparities in AD, our analysis indicated that 
biological sex moderates the rate of cognitive decline associated with APOE4 
genotype. Meanwhile, we found that higher education levels may moderate the 
effect of APOE4, acting as a marker of cognitive reserve.

Personalized neurostimulation has been a potential treatment for many brain 
diseases, which requires insights into brain/skull geometry. Here, we developed 
an open source efficient pipeline BrainCalculator for automatically computing 
the skull thickness map, scalp-to-cortex distance (SCD), and brain volume based 
on T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We examined the 
influence of age and sex cross-sectionally in 407 cognitively normal older 
adults (71.9±8.0 years, 60.2% female) from the ADNI. We demonstrated the 
compatibility of our pipeline with commonly used preprocessing packages and 
found that BrainSuite Skullfinder was better suited for such automatic analysis 
compared to FSL Brain Extraction Tool 2 and SPM12- based unified segmentation 
using ground truth. We found that the sphenoid bone and temporal bone were 
thinnest among the skull regions in both females and males. There was no 
increase in regional minimum skull thickness with age except in the female 
sphenoid bone. No sex difference in minimum skull thickness or SCD was observed. 
Positive correlations between age and SCD were observed, faster in females 
(0.307%/y) than males (0.216%/y) in temporal SCD. A negative correlation was 
observed between age and whole brain volume computed based on brain surface 
(females -1.031%/y, males -0.998%/y). In conclusion, we developed an automatic 
pipeline for MR-based skull thickness map, SCD, and brain volume analysis and 
demonstrated the sex-dependent association between minimum regional skull 
thickness, SCD and brain volume with age. This pipeline might be useful for 
personalized neurostimulation planning.

Emerging evidence suggests that enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) may be a 
clinically significant neuroimaging marker of global cognitive function related 
to cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). We tested this possibility by assessing 
the relationship between ePVS and both a standardized measure of global 
cognitive function, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and an established 
marker of cSVD, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) volume. One hundred and 
eleven community-dwelling older adults (56-86) underwent neuroimaging and MoCA 
testing. Quantification of region-specific ePVS burden was performed using a 
previously validated visual rating method and WMH volumes were computed using 
the standard ADNI pipeline. Separate linear regression models were run with ePVS 
as a predictor of MoCA scores and whole brain WMH volume. Results indicated a 
negative association between MoCA scores and both total ePVS counts (P ≤ 0.001) 
and centrum semiovale ePVS counts (P ≤ 0.001), after controlling for other 
relevant cSVD variables. Further, WMH volumes were positively associated with 
total ePVS (P = 0.010), basal ganglia ePVS (P ≤ 0.001), and centrum semiovale 
ePVS (P = 0.027). Our results suggest that ePVS burden, particularly in the 
centrum semiovale, may be a clinically significant neuroimaging marker of global 
cognitive dysfunction related to cSVD.

Multimodal neuroimaging has gained traction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
diagnosis by integrating information from multiple imaging modalities to enhance 
classification accuracy. However, effectively handling heterogeneous data 
sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods 
remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address 
these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a 
strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations 
include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, 
both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, 
varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image 
characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. 
Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial 
resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and 
instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and 
integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels 
and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the 
model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, 
applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases 
stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. 
This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing 
complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion 
method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 
participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive 
Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 
(OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI 
and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain 
atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various 
stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the 
quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive 
set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement 
(SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image 
resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of 
information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing 
Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between 
two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of 
edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is 
further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer. In the classification of AD 
vs. Cognitive Normal, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.00%, specificity of 
99.00%, and sensitivity of 98.44% on the AANLIB dataset.

BACKGROUND: Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) and chitinase-3-like protein 1 
(CHI3L1 or YKL-40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are newly discovered markers 
indicating neuronal damage and microglial activation, respectively. 
Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) reflects the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and is useful as diagnostic markers for AD. However, it is unknown whether 
these biomarkers have similar or complementary information in AD.
METHODS: We stratified 121 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN), stable 
mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), progressive MCI (pMCI), and dementia due to 
AD. Analysis of covariance (ANOVA) and chi-square analyses, Spearman 
correlation, and logistic regression models were performed to test the 
demographic, associations between biomarkers, and diagnostic accuracies, 
respectively. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of 
CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) on above biomarkers within diagnostic groups, the combination 
of diagnostic group and Aβ status as predictor, and CSF biomarkers as predictors 
of AD features, including cognition measured by Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) and brain structure and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measured by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: P-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 were all predictors of AD diagnosis, but 
combinations of biomarkers did not improve the diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.924 
for p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40) compared to p-tau (AUC 0.922). P-tau and VILIP-1 
were highly correlated (r = 0.639, p < 0.001) and strongly associated with Aβ 
pathology across clinical stages of AD, while YKL-40 was correlated with Aβ 
pathology in CN and AD groups. VILIP-1 was associated with acceleration of 
cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and expansion of ventricles in 
longitudinal analyses. YKL-40 was associated with hippocampal atrophy at 
baseline and follow-up, while p-tau was only associated with worsening WMH at 
baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF levels of p-tau, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 may have utility for 
discriminating between cognitively normal subjects and patients with AD. 
Increased levels of both VILIP-1 and YKL-40 may be associated with disease 
degeneration. These CSF biomarkers should be considered for future assessment in 
the characterization of the natural history of AD.

Random Forest (RF) is a bagging ensemble model and has many important 
advantages, such as robustness to noise, an effective structure for complex 
multimodal data and parallel computing, and also provides important features 
that help investigate biomarkers. Despite these benefits, RF is not used 
actively to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) with brain MRIs. Recent studies 
have reported RF's effectiveness in predicting AD, but the test sample sizes 
were too small to draw any solid conclusions. Thus, it is timely to compare RF 
with other learning model methods, including deep learning, particularly with 
large amounts of data. In this study, we tested RF and various machine learning 
models with regional volumes from 2250 brain MRIs: 687 normal controls (NC), 
1094 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 469 AD that ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database) provided. Three types of features sets (63, 
29, and 22 features) were selected, and classification accuracies were computed 
with RF, Support vector machine (SVM), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and 
Convolutional neural network (CNN). As a result, RF, MLP, and CNN showed high 
performances of 90.2%, 89.6%, and 90.5% with 63 features. Interestingly, when 22 
features were used, RF showed the smallest decrease in accuracy, -3.8%, and the 
standard deviation did not change significantly, while MLP and CNN yielded 
decreases in accuracy of -6.8% and -4.5% with changes in the standard deviation 
from 3.3% to 4.0% for MLP and 2.1% to 7.0% for CNN, indicating that RF predicts 
AD more reliably with fewer features. In addition, we investigated the 
importance of the features that RF provides, and identified the hippocampus, 
amygdala, and inferior lateral ventricle as the major contributors in 
classifying NC, MCI, and AD. On average, AD showed smaller hippocampus and 
amygdala volumes and a larger volume of inferior lateral ventricle than those of 
MCI and NC.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Amyloid plaques are one of the physical hallmarks of 
Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study is to predict amyloid 
positivity non-invasively from FDG-PET images using a radiomics approach.
METHODS: We obtained FDG-PET images of 301 individuals from various groups, 
including control normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), from the ADNI database. Following the utilization of the CSF 
Aβ1-42 (192) and Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) (1.11) thresholds 
derived from Florbetapir scans, the subjects were categorized into two 
categories: those with a positive amyloid status (n = 185) and those with a 
negative amyloid status (n = 116). The process of segmenting the entire brain 
into 95 classes using the DKT-atlas was utilized. Following that, we obtained 
120 characteristics for each of the 95 regions of interest (ROIs). We employed 
eight feature selection methods to analyze the features. Additionally, we 
utilized eight different classifiers on the 20 most significant features 
extracted from each feature selection method. Finally, in order to improve 
interpretability, we selected the most important features and ROIs.
RESULT: We found that the GNB classifier and the LASSO feature selection method 
had the best performance with an average accuracy of (AUC=0.924) while using 18 
features on 15 ROIs. We were then able to reduce the model to three regions 
(Hippocampus, inferior parietal, and isthmus cingulate) and three gray-level 
based features (AUC=0.853).
CONCLUSION: The FDG-PET images which serve to study metabolic activity can be 
used to predict amyloid positivity without the use of invasive methods or 
another PET tracer and study. The proposed method has superior prediction 
accuracy with respect to similar studies reported in the literature using other 
imaging modalities. Only three brain regions had a high impact on amyloid 
positivity results.

INTRODUCTION: Automated brain MRI morphometry, including hippocampal volumetry 
for Alzheimer disease, is increasingly recognized as a biomarker. Consequently, 
a rapidly increasing number of software tools have become available. We tested 
whether modifications of simple MR protocol parameters typically used in 
clinical routine systematically bias automated brain MRI segmentation results.
METHODS: The study was approved by the local ethical committee and included 20 
consecutive patients (13 females, mean age 75.8 ± 13.8 years) undergoing 
clinical brain MRI at 1.5 T for workup of cognitive decline. We compared three 
3D T1 magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequences with the 
following parameter settings: ADNI-2 1.2 mm iso-voxel, no image filtering, 
LOCAL- 1.0 mm iso-voxel no image filtering, LOCAL+ 1.0 mm iso-voxel with image 
edge enhancement. Brain segmentation was performed by two different and 
established analysis tools, FreeSurfer and MorphoBox, using standard parameters.
RESULTS: Spatial resolution (1.0 versus 1.2 mm iso-voxel) and modification in 
contrast resulted in relative estimated volume difference of up to 4.28 % 
(p < 0.001) in cortical gray matter and 4.16 % (p < 0.01) in hippocampus. Image 
data filtering resulted in estimated volume difference of up to 5.48 % 
(p < 0.05) in cortical gray matter.
CONCLUSION: A simple change of MR parameters, notably spatial resolution, 
contrast, and filtering, may systematically bias results of automated brain MRI 
morphometry of up to 4-5 %. This is in the same range as early disease-related 
brain volume alterations, for example, in Alzheimer disease. Automated brain 
segmentation software packages should therefore require strict MR parameter 
selection or include compensatory algorithms to avoid MR parameter-related bias 
of brain morphometry results.

Although much prior work has focused on the known cortical pathology that 
defines Alzheimer's disease (AD) histologically, recent work has additionally 
demonstrated substantial damage to the cerebral white matter in this condition. 
While there is large evidence of diffuse damage to the white matter in AD, it is 
unclear whether specific white matter tracts exhibit a more accelerated pattern 
of damage and whether the damage is associated with the classical 
neurodegenerative changes of AD. In this study, we investigated microstructural 
differences in the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of 
individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using recently 
developed automated diffusion tractography procedures in the Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Eighteen major fiber bundles in a total 
of 36 individuals with AD, 81 MCI and 60 control participants were examined with 
the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) procedure available as 
part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. For each fiber bundle, 
the mean fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, radial and axial diffusivities 
were calculated. Individuals with AD had increased diffusivities in both left 
and right cingulum-angular bundles compared to control participants (p<0.001). 
Individuals with MCI also had increased axial and mean diffusivities and 
increased FA in both cingulum-angular bundles compared to control participants 
(p<0.05) and decreased radial diffusivity compared to individuals with AD 
(p<0.05). We additionally examined how white matter deterioration relates to 
hippocampal volume, a traditional imaging measure of AD pathology, and found the 
strongest negative correlations in AD patients between hippocampal volume and 
the diffusivities of the cingulum-angular and cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundles 
and of the corticospinal tracts (p<0.05). However, statistically controlling for 
hippocampal volume did not remove all group differences in white matter 
measures, suggesting a unique contribution of white matter damage to AD 
unexplained by this disease biomarker. These results suggest that (1) 
AD-associated deterioration of white matter fibers is greatest in tracts known 
to be connected to areas of pathology in AD and (2) lower white matter tract 
integrity is more diffusely associated with lower hippocampal volume indicating 
that the pathology in the white matter follows to some degree the 
neurodegenerative staging and progression of this condition.

In recent years, several high-dimensional, accurate, and effective 
classification methods have been proposed for the automatic discrimination of 
the subject between Alzheimer's disease (AD) or its prodromal phase {i.e., mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI)} and healthy control (HC) persons based on 
T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). These methods emphasis 
only on using the individual feature from sMRI images for the classification of 
AD, MCI, and HC subjects and their achieved classification accuracy is low. 
However, latest multimodal studies have shown that combining multiple features 
from different sMRI analysis techniques can improve the classification accuracy 
for these types of subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel classification 
technique that precisely distinguishes individuals with AD, aAD (stable MCI, who 
had not converted to AD within a 36-month time period), and mAD (MCI caused by 
AD, who had converted to AD within a 36-month time period) from HC individuals. 
The proposed method combines three different features extracted from structural 
MR (sMR) images using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), hippocampal volume (HV), 
and cortical and subcortical segmented region techniques. Three classification 
experiments were performed (AD vs. HC, aAD vs. mAD, and HC vs. mAD) with 326 
subjects (171 elderly controls and 81 AD, 35 aAD, and 39 mAD patients). For the 
development and validation of the proposed classification method, we acquired 
the sMR images from the dataset of the National Research Center for Dementia 
(NRCD). A five-fold cross-validation technique was applied to find the optimal 
hyperparameters for the classifier, and the classification performance was 
compared by using three well-known classifiers: K-nearest neighbor, support 
vector machine, and random forest. Overall, the proposed model with the SVM 
classifier achieved the best performance on the NRCD dataset. For the individual 
feature, the VBM technique provided the best results followed by the HV 
technique. However, the use of combined features improved the classification 
accuracy and predictive power for the early classification of AD compared to the 
use of individual features. The most stable and reliable classification results 
were achieved when combining all extracted features. Additionally, to analyze 
the efficiency of the proposed model, we used the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to compare the classification performance 
of the proposed model with those of several state-of-the-art methods.

PURPOSE: Tau pathology progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained 
through the network degeneration hypothesis and the neuropathological Braak 
stages; however, the compatibility of these models remains unclear.
METHODS: We utilized [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET scans of 39 subjects with AD and 39 
sex-matched amyloid-negative healthy controls (HC) in the ADNI (Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset. The peak cluster of tau-tracer uptake 
was identified in each Braak stage of neuropathological tau deposition and used 
to create a seed-based functional connectivity network (FCN) using 198 HC 
subjects, to identify healthy networks unaffected by neurodegeneration.
RESULTS: Voxel-wise tau deposition was both significantly higher inside relative 
to outside FCNs and correlated significantly and positively with levels of 
healthy functional connectivity. Within many isolated Braak stages and regions, 
the correlation between tau and intrinsic functional connectivity was 
significantly stronger than it was across the whole brain. In this way, each 
peak cluster of tau was related to multiple Braak stages traditionally 
associated with both earlier and later stages of disease.
CONCLUSION: We show specificity of healthy FCN topography for AD-pathological 
tau as well as positive voxel-by-voxel correlations between pathological tau and 
healthy functional connectivity. We propose a model of "up- and downstream" 
functional tau progression, suggesting that tau pathology evolves along 
functional connectivity networks not only "downstream" (i.e., along the expected 
sequence of the established Braak stages) but also in part "upstream" or 
"retrograde" (i.e., against the expected sequence of the established Braak 
stages), with pathology in earlier Braak stages intensified by its functional 
relationship to later disease stages.

with chronic mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared with 
patients with more severe injury. Commercially available software methods 
including NeuroQuant® are being used increasingly to assess MRI brain volume in 
patients with TBI.Methods: 50 patients with mild or moderate TBI were compared 
to the NeuroQuant® normal control database (n = thousands) with respect to MRI 
brain volume.Results: The patients had many areas of abnormal enlargement and 
fewer areas of atrophy, including abnormally small cerebral white matter (CWM) 
limited to the first 10 months after injury. Examination of correlations within 
the patient group between CWM volume and volumes of the abnormally enlarged 
regions showed multiple significant negative correlations, indicating that CWM 
atrophy correlated with enlargement of the other regions.Discussion: The finding 
of many regions of abnormal brain enlargement was relatively new, although a 
couple of previous studies of patients with mild TBI found similar but more 
limited findings. The cause of the abnormal enlargement was unknown, but 
possibilities included: (1) hyperactivity and hypertrophy; or (2) chronic 
neuro-inflammation and edema.Abbreviations: ADNI: Alzheimer's Disease

More and more large-scale imaging genetic studies are being widely conducted to 
collect a rich set of imaging, genetic, and clinical data to detect putative 
genes for complexly inherited neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. 
Several major big-data challenges arise from testing genome-wide (NC>12 million 
known variants) associations with signals at millions of locations (NV~10(6)) in 
the brain from thousands of subjects (n~10(3)). The aim of this paper is to 
develop a Fast Voxelwise Genome Wide Association analysiS (FVGWAS) framework to 
efficiently carry out whole-genome analyses of whole-brain data. FVGWAS consists 
of three components including a heteroscedastic linear model, a global sure 
independence screening (GSIS) procedure, and a detection procedure based on wild 
bootstrap methods. Specifically, for standard linear association, the 
computational complexity is O (nNVNC) for voxelwise genome wide association 
analysis (VGWAS) method compared with O ((NC+NV)n(2)) for FVGWAS. Simulation 
studies show that FVGWAS is an efficient method of searching sparse signals in 
an extremely large search space, while controlling for the family-wise error 
rate. Finally, we have successfully applied FVGWAS to a large-scale imaging 
genetic data analysis of ADNI data with 708 subjects, 193,275voxels in RAVENS 
maps, and 501,584 SNPs, and the total processing time was 203,645s for a single 
CPU. Our FVGWAS may be a valuable statistical toolbox for large-scale imaging 
genetic analysis as the field is rapidly advancing with ultra-high-resolution 
imaging and whole-genome sequencing.

BACKGROUND: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive 
neuroimaging tool, used in brain function research and is also a low-frequency 
signal, showing brain activation by means of Oxygen consumption.
OBJECTIVE: One of the reliable methods in brain functional connectivity analysis 
is the correlation method. In correlation analysis, the relationship between two 
time-series has been investigated. In fMRI analysis, the Pearson correlation is 
used while there are other methods. This study aims to investigate the different 
correlation methods in functional connectivity analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this analytical research, based on fMRI signals of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy individuals from the ADNI database, brain 
functional networks were generated using correlation techniques, including 
Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman. Then, the global and nodal measures were 
calculated in the whole brain and in the most important resting-state network 
called Default Mode Network (DMN). The statistical analysis was performed using 
non-parametric permutation test.
RESULTS: Results show that although in nodal analysis, the performance of 
correlation methods was almost similar, in global features, the Spearman and 
Kendall were better in distinguishing AD subjects. Note that, nodal analysis 
reveals that the functional connectivity of the posterior areas in the brain was 
more damaged because of AD in comparison to frontal areas. Moreover, the 
functional connectivity of the dominant hemisphere was disrupted more.
CONCLUSION: Although the Pearson method has limitations in capturing non-linear 
relationships, it is the most prevalent method. To have a comprehensive 
analysis, investigating non-linear methods such as distance correlation is 
recommended.

Categorical predictive and disease progression modeling in the early stage of 
Alzheimer's disease.

Valencia 3, 28012 Madrid, Spain.

BACKGROUND: A preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precedes the 
symptomatic phases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, which 
constitutes a window of opportunities for preventive therapies or delaying 
dementia onset.
NEW METHOD: We propose to use categorical predictive models based on survival 
analysis with longitudinal data which are capable of determining subsets of 
markers to classify cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects who progress into 
MCI/dementia or not. Subsequently, the proposed combination of markers was used 
to construct disease progression models (DPMs), which reveal long-term 
pathological trajectories from short-term clinical data. The proposed 
methodology was applied to a population recruited by the ADNI.
RESULTS: A very small subset of standard MRI-based data, CSF markers and 
cognitive measures was used to predict CU-to-MCI/dementia progression. The 
longitudinal data of these selected markers were used to construct DPMs using 
the algorithms of growth models by alternating conditional expectation (GRACE) 
and the latent time joint mixed effects model (LTJMM). The results show that the 
natural history of the proposed cognitive decline classifies the subjects well 
according to the clinical groups and shows a moderate correlation between the 
conversion times and their estimates by the algorithms.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Unlike the training of the DPM algorithms 
without preselection of the markers, here, it is proposed to construct and 
evaluate the DPMs using the subsets of markers defined by the categorical 
predictive models.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimates of the natural history of the proposed cognitive 
decline from GRACE were more robust than those using LTJMM. The transition from 
normal to cognitive decline is mostly associated with an increase in temporal 
atrophy, worsening of clinical scores and pTAU/Aβ. Furthermore, pTAU/Aβ, 
Everyday Cognition score and the normalized volume of the entorhinal cortex show 
alterations of more than 20% fifteen years before the onset of cognitive 
decline.

BACKGROUND: Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) has been identified as one of the most 
associated loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and recently was reported to 
modulate tau pathology to mediate AD in vitro. However, the effects of BIN1 on 
the AD related biomarkers in AD continuum were not specifically assessed.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the effects of BIN1 loci on AD specific biomarkers (CSF 
proteins, brain structures, glucose and amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolisms) to 
investigate the role BIN1 in AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: We calculated the associations of BIN1 loci with these markers at 
baseline and follow-up in multiple linear models in 812 ADNI subjects.
RESULTS: BIN1 loci were significantly associated with the levels of T-tau 
(rs744373: pc = 0.047, rs13031703: pc = 0.042) and P-tau (rs744373: pc = 0.044, 
rs13031703: pc = 0.019), but not with Aβ in CSF test. BIN1 genotypes were 
strongly related to atrophy of hippocampus (rs7561528: pc = 0.011), CA1 
(rs1469980: pc = 0.029) and parahippocampus (rs72838284, pc = 0.017) on MRI, and 
to glucose metabolism on FDG-PET, but not to Aβ deposition on AV45-PET imaging. 
Furthermore, haplotype and subgroup analysis confirmed these significant 
findings. In addition, the loci associated with these markers were also 
identified to influence the risk for AD in the meta-analysis of 74 046 European 
individuals.
CONCLUSION: This study supported that BIN1 contributes to the risk of AD by 
altering neural degeneration (abnormal tau, brain atrophy and glucose 
metabolism) but not Aβ pathology.

Accurate cortical thickness estimation is important for the study of many 
neurodegenerative diseases. Many approaches have been previously proposed, which 
can be broadly categorised as mesh-based and voxel-based. While the mesh-based 
approaches can potentially achieve subvoxel resolution, they usually lack the 
computational efficiency needed for clinical applications and large database 
studies. In contrast, voxel-based approaches, are computationally efficient, but 
lack accuracy. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel voxel-based method 
based upon the Laplacian definition of thickness that is both accurate and 
computationally efficient. A framework was developed to estimate and integrate 
the partial volume information within the thickness estimation process. Firstly, 
in a Lagrangian step, the boundaries are initialized using the partial volume 
information. Subsequently, in an Eulerian step, a pair of partial differential 
equations are solved on the remaining voxels to finally compute the thickness. 
Using partial volume information significantly improved the accuracy of the 
thickness estimation on synthetic phantoms, and improved reproducibility on real 
data. Significant differences in the hippocampus and temporal lobe between 
healthy controls (NC), mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) patients were found on clinical data from the ADNI database. We compared 
our method in terms of precision, computational speed and statistical power 
against the Eulerian approach. With a slight increase in computation time, 
accuracy and precision were greatly improved. Power analysis demonstrated the 
ability of our method to yield statistically significant results when comparing 
AD and NC. Overall, with our method the number of samples is reduced by 25% to 
find significant differences between the two groups.

Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images is important in 
recent imaging based studies. In the past years, multi-atlas patch-based label 
fusion methods have achieved a great success in medical image segmentation. In 
these methods, the appearance of each input image patch is first represented by 
an atlas patch dictionary (in the image domain), and then the latent label of 
the input image patch is predicted by applying the estimated representation 
coefficients to the corresponding anatomical labels of the atlas patches in the 
atlas label dictionary (in the label domain). However, due to the generally 
large gap between the patch appearance in the image domain and the patch 
structure in the label domain, the estimated (patch) representation coefficients 
from the image domain may not be optimal for the final label fusion, thus 
reducing the labeling accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel label 
fusion framework to seek for the suitable label fusion weights by progressively 
constructing a dynamic dictionary in a layer-by-layer manner, where the 
intermediate dictionaries act as a sequence of guidance to steer the transition 
of (patch) representation coefficients from the image domain to the label 
domain. Our proposed multi-layer label fusion framework is flexible enough to be 
applied to the existing labeling methods for improving their label fusion 
performance, i.e., by extending their single-layer static dictionary to the 
multi-layer dynamic dictionary. The experimental results show that our proposed 
progressive label fusion method achieves more accurate hippocampal segmentation 
results for the ADNI dataset, compared to the counterpart methods using only the 
single-layer static dictionary.

To quantify the "segmentation noise" of several widely used fully automatic 
methods for measuring longitudinal hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease 
and compare the results to the segmentation noise of manual segmentation over 
both 1 and 3 years. The segmentation noise of 5 longitudinal hippocampal atrophy 
measurement methods was quantified, including checking its Gaussianity, using 
264 subjects from the ADNI1 back-to-back (BTB) data set over both 1 year and 3 
year intervals. The segmentation methods were FreeSurfer 5.3.0 both cross 
sectional and longitudinal, FreeSurfer 6.0.0 longitudinal, MAPS-HBSI and 
FSL/FIRST 5.0.8. The BTB manual segmentation of 75 ADNI subjects from a previous 
study provided the manual distributions for comparison. All methods, including 
the manual segmentation, violated the Gaussianity assumption. Two methods, 
FreeSurfer 6.0.0 and MAPS-HBSI, had a segmentation noise substantially less than 
a surrogate for manual segmentation. FreeSurfer 5.3.0 longitudinal was confirmed 
as a surrogate for manual segmentation. The violation of the Gaussian assumption 
by the segmentation methods assessed, including manual, suggests results of 
previous studies that assumed Gaussian statistics without confirmation may need 
review. Fully automatic FreeSurfer 6.0.0 and MAPS-HBSI both have lower 
segmentation noise than manual requiring less than two thirds of the subjects to 
detect the same treatment effect.

Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Their Influence on 
Development and Pattern of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Later Life.

Francisco, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) are potential risk factors for the development of dementia including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. The findings of studies investigating 
this question are inconsistent though.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate if these inconsistencies are caused by the existence 
of subgroups with different vulnerability for AD pathology and if these 
subgroups are characterized by atypical tau load/atrophy pattern.
METHODS: The MRI and PET data of 89 subjects with or without previous TBI and/or 
PTSD from the DoD ADNI database were used to calculate an age-corrected gray 
matter tau mismatch metric (ageN-T mismatch-score and matrix) for each subject. 
This metric provides a measure to what degree regional tau accumulation drives 
regional gray matter atrophy (matrix) and can be used to calculate a summary 
score (score) reflecting the severity of AD pathology in an individual.
RESULTS: The ageN-T mismatch summary score was positively correlated with whole 
brain beta-amyloid load and general cognitive function but not with PTSD or TBI 
severity. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified five different spatial 
patterns of tau-gray matter interactions. These clusters reflected the different 
stages of the typical AD tau progression pattern. None was exclusively 
associated with PTSD and/or TBI.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a) although subsets of patients with 
PTSD and/or TBI develop AD-pathology, a history of TBI or PTSD alone or both is 
not associated with a significantly higher risk to develop AD pathology in later 
life. b) remote TBI or PTSD do not modify the typical AD pathology distribution 
pattern.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele is a recognized genetic risk factor for 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Studies have shown that APOE ɛ4 mediates the 
modulation of intrinsic functional brain networks in cognitively normal 
individuals and significantly disrupts the whole-brain topological structure in 
AD patients. However, how APOE ɛ4 regulates brain functional connectivity (FC) 
and consequently affects the levels of cognitive impairment in AD patients 
remains unknown. In this study, we systematically analyzed functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) data from two distinct cohorts: an In-house dataset 
includes 59 AD patients (73.37 ± 6.42 years), and the ADNI dataset includes 117 
AD patients (74.91 ± 7.91 years). Experimental comparisons were conducted by 
grouping AD patients based on both APOE ɛ4 status and cognitive impairment 
levels of AD. Network-Based Statistic (NBS) method and the Graph Neural Network 
Explainer (GNN-Explainer) were combined to identify significant FC changes 
across different comparisons. Importantly, the GNN-Explainer method was 
introduced as an enhancement over the NBS method to better model complex 
high-order nonlinear characteristics for discovering FC features that 
significantly contribute to classification tasks. The results showed that APOE 
ɛ4 primarily influenced temporal lobe FCs, while it influenced different 
cognitive impairment levels of AD by adjusting prefrontal-parietal FCs. These 
findings were validated by p-values < 0.05 from NBS method, and 5-fold 
cross-validation along with ablation studies from the GNN-Explainer method. In 
conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the role of APOE ɛ4 in 
altering FC dynamics during the progression of AD, highlighting potential 
targets for early intervention.

Objective. Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common disease of the elderly with 
unknown etiology, has been adversely affecting many people, especially with the 
aging of the population and the younger trend of this disease. Current 
artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on individual information or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) can solve the problem of diagnostic sensitivity and 
specificity, but still face the challenges of interpretability and clinical 
feasibility. In this study, we propose an interpretable multimodal deep 
reinforcement learning model for inferring pathological features and the 
diagnosis of AD.Approach. First, for better clinical feasibility, the 
compressed-sensing MRI image is reconstructed using an interpretable deep 
reinforcement learning model. Then, the reconstructed MRI is input into the full 
convolution neural network to generate a pixel-level disease probability risk 
map (DPM) of the whole brain for AD. The DPM of important brain regions and 
individual information are then input into the attention-based fully deep neural 
network to obtain the diagnosis results and analyze the biomarkers. We used 1349 
multi-center samples to construct and test the model.Main results.Finally, the 
model obtained 99.6% ± 0.2%, 97.9% ± 0.2%, and 96.1% ± 0.3% area under curve in 
ADNI, AIBL and NACC, respectively. The model also provides an effective analysis 
of multimodal pathology, predicts the imaging biomarkers in MRI and the weight 
of each individual item of information. In this study, a deep reinforcement 
learning model was designed, which can not only accurately diagnose AD, but 
analyze potential biomarkers.Significance. In this study, a deep reinforcement 
learning model was designed. The model builds a bridge between clinical practice

OBJECTIVE: The pathologic validation of European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Center Harmonized Hippocampal 
Segmentation Protocol (HarP).
METHODS: Temporal lobes of nine Alzheimer's disease (AD) and seven cognitively 
normal subjects were scanned post-mortem at 7 Tesla. Hippocampal volumes were 
obtained with HarP. Six-micrometer-thick hippocampal slices were stained for 
amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and cresyl violet. Hippocampal subfields were manually 
traced. Neuronal counts, Aβ, and tau burden for each hippocampal subfield were 
obtained.
RESULTS: We found significant correlations between hippocampal volume and Braak 
and Braak staging (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau (ρ = -0.53, P = .034), Aβ burden (ρ 
= -0.61, P = .012), and neuronal count (ρ = 0.77, P < .001). Exploratory 
subfield-wise significant associations were found for Aβ in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 
(ρ = -0.58, P = .019) and subiculum (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau in CA2 (ρ = 
-0.59, P = .016), and CA3 (ρ = -0.5, P = .047), and neuronal count in CA1 (ρ = 
0.55, P = .028), CA3 (ρ = 0.65, P = .006), and CA4 (ρ = 0.76, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations provide pathological confirmation of 
hippocampal morphometry as a valid biomarker for AD and pathologic validation of 
HarP.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the 
most common cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide. The exact etiology of 
AD, particularly its genetic mechanisms, remains incompletely understood. 
Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which primarily focus on 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with main effects, provide limited 
explanations for the "missing heritability" of AD, while there is growing 
evidence supporting the important role of epistasis. In this study, we performed 
a genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction detection using a linear regression model and 
employed multiple GPUs for parallel computing, significantly enhancing the speed 
of whole-genome analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau 
(P-tau)/amyloid-[Formula: see text] (A[Formula: see text]) ratio was used as a 
quantitative trait (QT) to enhance statistical power. Age, gender, and clinical 
diagnosis were included as covariates to control for potential non-genetic 
factors influencing AD. We identified 961 pairs of statistically significant 
SNP-SNP interactions, explaining a high-level variance of P-tau/A[Formula: see 
text] level, all of which exhibited marginal main effects. Additionally, we 
replicated 432 previously reported AD-related genes and found 11 gene-gene 
interaction pairs overlapping with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network. Our findings may contribute to partially explain the "missing 
heritability" of AD. The identified subnetwork may be associated with synaptic 
dysfunction, Wnt signaling pathway, oligodendrocytes, inflammation, hippocampus, 
and neuronal cells.

BACKGROUND: Predicting the prognosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has 
outstanding clinical value, and the hippocampal volume is a reliable imaging 
biomarker of AD diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to longitudinally assess hippocampal sub-regional difference 
(volume and asymmetry) among progressive MCI (pMCI), stable MCI (sMCI) patients, 
and normal elderly.
METHODS: We identified 29 pMCI, 52 sMCI, and 102 normal controls (NC) from the 
ADNI database. All participants underwent neuropsychological assessment and 3T 
MRI scans three times. The time interval between consecutive MRI sessions was 
about 1 year. Volumes of hippocampal subfield were measured by Freesurfer. Based 
on the analysis of variance, repeated measures analyses, and receiver operating 
characteristic curves, we compared cross-sectional and longitudinal alteration 
sub-regional volume and asymmetry index.
RESULTS: Compared to NC, both MCI groups showed significant atrophy in all 
subfields. At baseline, pMCI have a smaller volume than sMCI in the bilateral 
subiculum, molecular layer (ML), the molecular and granule cell layers of the 
dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4, and right tail. Furthermore, repeated measures 
analyses revealed that pMCI patients showed a faster volume loss than sMCI in 
bilateral subiculum and ML. After controlling for age, gender, and education, 
most results remained unchanged. However, none of the hippocampal sub-regional 
volumes performed better than the whole hippocampus in ROC analyses, and no 
asymmetric difference between pMCI and sMCI was found.
CONCLUSION: The faster volume loss in subiculum and ML suggest a higher risk of 
disease progression in MCI patients. The hippocampal asymmetry may have smaller 
value in predicting the MCI prognosis.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an essential part of the 
clinical assessment of patients at risk of Alzheimer dementia. One key challenge 
in sMRI-based computer-aided dementia diagnosis is to localize local 
pathological regions for discriminative feature learning. Existing solutions 
predominantly depend on generating saliency maps for pathology localization and 
handle the localization task independently of the dementia diagnosis task, 
leading to a complex multi-stage training pipeline that is hard to optimize with 
weakly-supervised sMRI-level annotations. In this work, we aim to simplify the 
pathology localization task and construct an end-to-end automatic localization 
framework (AutoLoc) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To this end, we first 
present an efficient pathology localization paradigm that directly predicts the 
coordinate of the most disease-related region in each sMRI slice. Then, we 
approximate the non-differentiable patch-cropping operation with the bilinear 
interpolation technique, which eliminates the barrier to gradient 
backpropagation and thus enables the joint optimization of localization and 
diagnosis tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used ADNI and AIBL datasets 
demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, we achieve 93.38% and 
81.12% accuracy on Alzheimer's disease classification and mild cognitive 
impairment conversion prediction tasks, respectively. Several important brain 
regions, such as rostral hippocampus and globus pallidus, are identified to be 
highly associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental benefit of biomarkers for 
prediction of Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) when added stepwise in the order of their collection in 
clinical routine. The model started with cognitive status characterized by the 
ADAS-13 score. Hippocampus volume (HV), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau 
(pTau), and the FDG t-sum score in an AD meta-region-of-interest were compared 
as neurodegeneration markers. CSF-Aβ1-42 was used as amyloidosis marker. The 
incremental prognostic benefit from these markers was assessed by stepwise 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in 402 ADNI MCI subjects. Predefined cutoffs were 
used to dichotomize patients as 'negative' or 'positive' for AD characteristic 
alteration with respect to each marker. Among the neurodegeneration markers, 
CSF-pTau provided the best incremental risk stratification when added to 
ADAS-13. FDG PET outperformed HV only in MCI subjects with relatively preserved 
cognition. Adding CSF-Aβ provided further risk stratification in pTau-positive 
subjects, independent of their cognitive status. Stepwise integration of 
biomarkers allows stepwise refinement of risk estimates for MCI-to-ADD 
progression. Incremental benefit strongly depends on the patient's status 
according to the preceding diagnostic steps. The stepwise Kaplan-Meier curves 
might be useful to optimize diagnostic workflow in individual patients.

Recently, multi-atlas patch-based label fusion has achieved many successes in 
medical imaging area. The basic assumption in the current state-of-the-art 
approaches is that the image patch at the target image point can be represented 
by a patch dictionary consisting of atlas patches from registered atlas images. 
Therefore, the label at the target image point can be determined by fusing 
labels of atlas image patches with similar anatomical structures. However, such 
assumption on image patch representation does not always hold in label fusion 
since (1) the image content within the patch may be corrupted due to noise and 
artifact; and (2) the distribution of morphometric patterns among atlas patches 
might be unbalanced such that the majority patterns can dominate label fusion 
result over other minority patterns. The violation of the above basic 
assumptions could significantly undermine the label fusion accuracy. To overcome 
these issues, we first consider forming label-specific group for the atlas 
patches with the same label. Then, we alter the conventional flat and shallow 
dictionary to a deep multi-layer structure, where the top layer (label-specific 
dictionaries) consists of groups of representative atlas patches and the 
subsequent layers (residual dictionaries) hierarchically encode the patchwise 
residual information in different scales. Thus, the label fusion follows the 
representation consensus across representative dictionaries. However, the 
representation of target patch in each group is iteratively optimized by using 
the representative atlas patches in each label-specific dictionary exclusively 
to match the principal patterns and also using all residual patterns across 
groups collaboratively to overcome the issue that some groups might be absent of 
certain variation patterns presented in the target image patch. Promising 
segmentation results have been achieved in labeling hippocampus on ADNI dataset, 
as well as basal ganglia and brainstem structures, compared to other counterpart 
label fusion methods.

A multivariate analysis method, orthogonal partial least squares to latent 
structures (OPLS), was used to discriminate Alzheimer's disease (AD), early and 
late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI and LMCI) from cognitively normal control 
(CN) using MRI and PET measures. FreeSurfer 5.1 generated 271 MRI features 
including 49 subcortical volumes, 68 cortical volumes, 68 cortical thicknesses, 
70 surface areas and 16 hippocampus subfields. Subjects with all aforementioned 
MRI measures passing quality control and valid Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG) and 
Florbetapir (18F) PET scans were selected from ADNI database, resulting in a 
total of 524 participants (137 CN, 214 EMCI, 103 LMCI and 70 AD) for the study. 
Altogether 286 features including 15 significant PET uptake features (7 for FDG 
and 8 for AV-45) were utilized for OPLS analysis. Predictive power was evaluated 
by Q2(Y), a quantifier of the statistical significance for class separation. The 
results show that MRI features (Q2(Y) =0.645), and PET features (Q2(Y) = 0.636) 
has comparable predictive power in separating AD from CN, and MRI features are 
better predictor of LMCI (Q2(Y) = 0.282) than PET (Q2(Y) = 0.294). Combination 
of PET and MRI has the most predictive power for LMCI and AD with Q2(Y) of 0.294 
and 0.721, respectively. While for EMCI, cortical thickness was found to be the 
best predictor with a Q2(Y) of 0.108, suggesting cortical thickness may be the 
first structural change ahead of others and should be prioritized in prediction 
of very mild cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and regional brain lobe atrophy 
coexist in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the 
association between them in patients with AD still lacks comprehensive 
investigation and solid imaging data support.
OBJECTIVE: We explored whether WMHs can promote the pathological process of AD 
by aggravating atrophy in specific brain regions and tried to explain the 
regional specificity of these relationships.
METHODS: A sample of 240 adults including 180 normal controls (NCs) and 80 cases 
with AD were drawn from the ADNI database. T1-weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated MRI of the participants were 
downloaded and were analyzed using AccuBrain® to generate the quantitative ratio 
of WMHs (WMHr, WMH volumes corrected by intracranial volume) and regional brain 
atrophy. We also divided WMHr into periventricular WMHr (PVWMHr) and deep WMHr 
(DWMHr) for the purpose of this study. The Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities 
Scale (CHIPS) scores were conducted by two evaluators. Independent t-test, 
Mann-Whitney U test, or χ2 test were used to compare the demographic 
characteristics, and Spearman correlation coefficient values were used to 
determine the association between WMHs and different regions of brain atrophy.
RESULTS: Positive association between WMHr and quantitative medial temporal lobe 
atrophy (QMTA) (r s = 0.281, p = 0.011), temporal lobe atrophy (r s = 0.285, p = 
0.011), and insular atrophy (r s = 0.406, p < 0.001) was found in the AD group 
before Bonferroni correction. PVWMHr contributed to these correlations. By 
separately analyzing the relationship between PVWMHr and brain atrophy, we found 
that there were still positive correlations after correction in QMTA (r s = 
0.325, p = 0.003), temporal lobe atrophy (r s = 0.298, p = 0.007), and insular 
atrophy (r s = 0.429, p < 0.001) in AD group.
CONCLUSION: WMH severity tends to be associated with regional brain atrophy in 
patients with AD, especially with medial temporal lobe, temporal lobe, and 
insular lobe atrophy. PVWMHs were devoted to these correlations.

In this study we propose a deformation-based framework to jointly model the 
influence of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the brain morphological 
evolution. Our approach combines a spatio-temporal description of both processes 
into a generative model. A reference morphology is deformed along specific 
trajectories to match subject specific morphologies. It is used to define two 
imaging progression markers: 1) a morphological age and 2) a disease score. 
These markers can be computed regionally in any brain region. The approach is 
evaluated on brain structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the ADNI 
database. The model is first estimated on a control population using 
longitudinal data, then, for each testing subject, the markers are computed 
cross-sectionally for each acquisition. The longitudinal evolution of these 
markers is then studied in relation with the clinical diagnosis of the subjects 
and used to generate possible morphological evolutions. In the model, the 
morphological changes associated with normal aging are mainly found around the 
ventricles, while the Alzheimer's disease specific changes are located in the 
temporal lobe and the hippocampal area. The statistical analysis of these 
markers highlights differences between clinical conditions even though the 
inter-subject variability is quite high. The model is also generative since it 
can be used to simulate plausible morphological trajectories associated with the 
disease. Our method quantifies two interpretable scalar imaging biomarkers 
assessing respectively the effects of aging and disease on brain morphology, at 
the individual and population level. These markers confirm the presence of an 
accelerated apparent aging component in Alzheimer's patients but they also 
highlight specific morphological changes that can help discriminate clinical 
conditions even in prodromal stages. More generally, the joint modeling of 
normal and pathological evolutions shows promising results to describe 
age-related brain diseases over long time scales.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) impacts men and women differently, but the 
effect of sex on predementia stages is unclear. The objective of this study was 
to examine whether sex moderates the impact of florbetapir positron emission 
tomography (PET) amyloid positivity (A+) on verbal learning and memory 
performance and hippocampal volume (HV) in normal cognition (NC) and early mild 
cognitive impairment (eMCI).
METHODS: Seven hundred forty-two participants with NC and participants with eMCI 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (second cohort [ADNI2] and 
Grand Opportunity Cohort [ADNI-GO]) were included. All had baseline florbetapir 
PET measured, and 526 had screening visit HV measured. Regression moderation 
models were used to examine whether A+ effects on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning 
Test learning and delayed recall and right and left HV (adjusted for total 
intracranial volume) were moderated by diagnosis and sex. Age, cognition at 
screening, education, and apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status were controlled.
RESULTS: Women with A+, but not those with florbetapir PET amyloid negative 
(A-),eMCI showed poorer learning. For women with NC, there was no relationship 
of A+ with learning. In contrast, A+ men trended toward poorer learning 
regardless of diagnosis. A similar trend was found for verbal delayed recall: 
Women with A+, but not A-, eMCI trended toward reduced delayed recall; no 
effects were observed for women with NC or for men. Hippocampal analyses 
indicated that women with A+, but not those with A-, eMCI, trended toward 
smaller right HV; no significant A+ effects were observed for women with NC. Men 
showed similar, though nonsignificant, patterns of smaller right HV in A+ eMCI, 
but not in men with A- eMCI or NC. No interactive effects of sex were noted for 
left HV.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with NC showed verbal learning and memory scores robust to 
A+, and women with A+ eMCI lost this advantage. In contrast, A+ impacted men's 
scores less significantly or not at all, and comparably across those with NC and 
eMCI. Sex marginally moderated the relationship of A+ and diagnosis with right 
HV, such that women with NC showed no A+ effect and women with A+ eMCI lost that 
advantage in neural integrity; the pattern in men was less clear. These findings 
show that women with A+ eMCI (i.e., prodromal AD) have differential neural and 
cognitive decline, which has implications for considering sex in early detection 
of AD and development of therapeutics.

Recent studies have shown that in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), subtle cognitive changes can be detected using sensitive 
neuropsychological measures, and have proposed the concept of 
objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD). We aimed to assess the 
functional alteration of hippocampal subfields in individuals with Obj-SCD and 
its association with cognition and pathological biomarkers. Forty-two 
participants with cognitively normal (CN), 29 with Obj-SCD, and 55 with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) were retrospectively collected from the ADNI 
database. Neuropsychological performance, functional MRI, and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) data were obtained. We calculated the seed-based functional 
connectivity (FC) of hippocampal subfields (cornu ammonis1 [CA1], CA2/3/dentate 
gyrus [DG], and subiculum) with whole-brain voxels. Additionally, we analyzed 
the correlation between FC values of significantly altered regions and 
neuropsychological performance and CSF biomarkers. The Obj-SCD group showed 
lower FC between left CA1-CA2/3/DG and right thalamus and higher FC between 
right subiculum and right superior parietal gyrus (SPG) compared with the CN and 
MCI groups. In the Obj-SCD group, FC values between left CA2/3/DG and right 
thalamus were positively associated with Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) 
recognition (r = 0.395, p = 0.046) and CSF Aβ1-42 levels (r = 0.466, p = 0.019), 
and FC values between left CA1 and right thalamus were positively correlated 
with CSF Aβ1-42 levels (r = 0.530, p = 0.006). Taken together, dysfunction in 
CA1-CA2/3/DG subregions suggests subtle cognitive impairment and AD-specific 
pathological changes in individuals with Obj-SCD. Additionally, increased 
subiculum connectivity may indicate early functional compensation for subtle 
cognitive changes.

BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive 
brain stimulation technique that uses weak electrical currents to modulate brain 
activity, thus potentially aiding the treatment of brain diseases. Although tDCS 
offers convenience, it yields inconsistent electric-field distributions among 
individuals. This inconsistency may be attributed to certain factors, such as 
brain atrophy. Brain atrophy is accompanied by increased cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) volume. Owing to the high electrical conductivity of CSF, its increased 
volume complicates current delivery to the brain, thus resulting in greater 
inter-subject variability.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the differences in tDCS-induced electric fields 
between groups with different severities of brain atrophy.
METHODS: We classified 180 magnetic resonance images into four groups based on 
the presence of Alzheimer's disease and sex. We used two montages, i.e., F-3 & 
Fp-2 and TP-9 & TP-10, to target the left rostral middle frontal gyrus and the 
hippocampus/amygdala complex, respectively. Differences between the groups in 
terms of regional volume variation, stimulation effect, and correlation were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the geometrical variations of 
the CSF and two target regions. Electric fields induced by tDCS were similar in 
both sexes. Unique patterns were observed in each group in the correlation 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that factors such as brain atrophy affect the tDCS 
results and that the factors present complex relationships. Further studies are 
necessary to better understand the relationships between these factors and 
optimize tDCS as a therapeutic tool.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation algorithms make it 
possible to study detailed medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures as 
hippocampal subfields and amygdala subnuclei, offering opportunities to develop 
biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We identified the MTL substructures significantly associated with 
tau-positron emission tomography (PET) signal in 581 non-demented individuals 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3). We confirmed our 
results in our UCLouvain cohort including 110 non-demented individuals by 
comparing volumes between individuals with different visual Braak's stages and 
clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Four amygdala subnuclei (cortical, central, medial, and accessory 
basal) were associated with tau in amyloid beta-positive (Aβ+) clinically normal 
(CN) individuals, while the global amygdala and hippocampal volumes were not. 
Using UCLouvain data, we observed that both Braak I-II and Aβ+ CN individuals 
had smaller volumes in these subnuclei, while no significant difference was 
observed in the global structure volumes or other subfields.
CONCLUSION: Measuring specific amygdala subnuclei, early atrophy may serve as a 
marker of temporal tauopathy in preclinical AD, identifying individuals at risk 
of progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amygdala atrophy is not homogeneous in preclinical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Tau pathology is associated with atrophy of specific amygdala 
subnuclei, specifically, the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal 
subnuclei. Hippocampal and amygdala volume is not associated with tau in 
preclinical AD. Hippocampus and CA1-3 volume is reduced in preclinical AD, 
regardless of tau.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe cognitive decline and 
pathological changes in the brain (brain atrophy, hyperphosphorylation of tau, 
and deposition of amyloid-beta protein). Females have greater neuropathology (AD 
biomarkers and brain atrophy rates) and cognitive decline than males, however 
these effects can depend on diagnosis (amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) 
or AD) and APOE genotype (presence of ε4 alleles). Using the ADNI database 
(N = 630 females, N = 830 males), we analyzed the effect of sex, APOE genotype 
(non-carriers or carriers of APOEε4 alleles), and diagnosis (cognitively normal 
(CN), early aMCI (EMCI), late aMCI (LMCI), probable AD) on cognition (memory and 
executive function), hippocampal volume, and AD biomarkers (CSF levels of 
amyloid beta, tau, and ptau). Regardless of APOE genotype, memory scores were 
higher in CN, EMCI, and LMCI females compared to males but this sex difference 
was absent in probable AD, which may suggest a delay in the onset of cognitive 
decline or diagnosis and/or a faster trajectory of cognitive decline in females. 
We found that, regardless of diagnosis, CSF tau-pathology was disproportionately 
elevated in female carriers of APOEε4 alleles compared to males. In contrast, 
male carriers of APOEε4 alleles had reduced levels of CSF amyloid beta compared 
to females, irrespective of diagnosis. We also detected sex differences in 
hippocampal volume but the direction was dependent on the method of correction. 
Altogether results suggest that across diagnosis females show greater memory 
decline compared to males and APOE genotype affects AD neuropathology 
differently in males and females which may influence sex differences in 
incidence and progression of aMCI and AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and AD individuals 
often present significant cerebrovascular disease (CVD) symptomology. AD with 
significant levels of CVD is frequently labeled mixed dementia (or sometimes 
AD-CVD), and the differentiation of these two neuropathologies (AD, AD-CVD) from 
each other is challenging, especially at early stages. In this study, we 
compared the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes in AD (n = 83) and 
AD-CVD (n = 37) individuals compared with those of cognitively healthy controls 
(n = 85) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of their MRI scans. The control 
individuals, matched for age and sex with our two dementia groups, were taken 
from the ADNI. The VBM analysis showed widespread patterns of significantly 
lower GM and WM volume in both dementia groups compared to the control group 
(P < .05, family-wise error corrected). While comparing with AD-CVD, the AD 
group mainly demonstrated a trend of lower volumes in the GM of the left putamen 
and right hippocampus and WM of the right thalamus (uncorrected P < .005 with 
cluster threshold, K = 10). The AD-CVD group relative to AD tended to present 
lower GM and WM volumes, mainly in the cerebellar lobules and right brainstem 
regions, respectively (uncorrected P < .005 with cluster threshold, K = 10). 
Although finding a discriminatory feature in structural MRI data between AD and 
AD-CVD neuropathologies is challenging, these results provide preliminary 
evidence that demands further investigation in a larger sample size.

Recently, multi-atlas patch-based label fusion has received an increasing 
interest in the medical image segmentation field. After warping the anatomical 
labels from the atlas images to the target image by registration, label fusion 
is the key step to determine the latent label for each target image point. Two 
popular types of patch-based label fusion approaches are (1) 
reconstruction-based approaches that compute the target labels as a weighted 
average of atlas labels, where the weights are derived by reconstructing the 
target image patch using the atlas image patches; and (2) classification-based 
approaches that determine the target label as a mapping of the target image 
patch, where the mapping function is often learned using the atlas image patches 
and their corresponding labels. Both approaches have their advantages and 
limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel patch-based label fusion method 
to combine the above two types of approaches via matrix completion (and hence, 
we call it transversal). As we will show, our method overcomes the individual 
limitations of both reconstruction-based and classification-based approaches. 
Since the labeling confidences may vary across the target image points, we 
further propose a sequential labeling framework that first labels the highly 
confident points and then gradually labels more challenging points in an 
iterative manner, guided by the label information determined in the previous 
iterations. We demonstrate the performance of our novel label fusion method in 
segmenting the hippocampus in the ADNI dataset, subcortical and limbic 
structures in the LONI dataset, and mid-brain structures in the SATA dataset. We 
achieve more accurate segmentation results than both reconstruction-based and 
classification-based approaches. Our label fusion method is also ranked 1st in 
the online SATA Multi-Atlas Segmentation Challenge.

Longitudinal MRI studies are of increasing importance to document the time 
course of neurodegenerative diseases as well as neuroprotective effects of a 
drug candidate in clinical trials. However, manual longitudinal image 
assessments are time consuming and conventional assessment routines often 
deliver unsatisfying study outcomes. Here, we propose a profound analysis 
pipeline that consists of the following coordinated steps: (1) an automated and 
highly precise image processing stream including voxel and surface based 
morphometry using latest highly detailed brain atlases such as the HCP MMP 1.0 
atlas with 360 cortical ROIs; (2) a profound statistical assessment using a 
multiplicative model of annual percent change (APC); and (3) a multiple testing 
correction adopted from genome-wide association studies that is optimally suited 
for longitudinal neuroimaging studies. We tested this analysis pipeline with 25 
Alzheimer's disease patients against 25 age-matched cognitively normal subjects 
with a baseline and a 1-year follow-up conventional MRI scan from the ADNI-3 
study. Even in this small cohort, we were able to report 22 significant 
measurements after multiple testing correction from SBM (including cortical 
volume, area and thickness) complementing only three statistically significant 
volume changes (left/right hippocampus and left amygdala) found by VBM. A 1-year 
decrease in brain morphometry coincided with an increasing clinical disability 
and cognitive decline in patients measured by MMSE, CDR GLOBAL, FAQ TOTAL and 
NPI TOTAL scores. This work shows that highly precise image assessments, APC 
computation and an adequate multiple testing correction can produce a 
significant study outcome even for small study sizes. With this, automated MRI 
processing is now available and reliable for routine use and clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Structural MRI measures for monitoring Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
progression are becoming instrumental in the clinical practice, and more so in 
the context of longitudinal studies. This investigation addresses the impact of 
four image analysis approaches on the longitudinal performance of the 
hippocampal volume.
METHODS: We present a hippocampal segmentation algorithm and validate it on a 
gold-standard manual tracing database. We segmented 460 subjects from ADNI, each 
subject having been scanned twice at baseline, 12-month and 24month follow-up 
scan (1.5T, T1 MRI). We used the bilateral hippocampal volume v and its 
variation, measured as the annualized volume change Λ=δv/year(mm(3)/y). Four 
processing approaches with different complexity are compared to maximize the 
longitudinal information, and they are tested for cohort discrimination ability. 
Reference cohorts are Controls vs. Alzheimer's Disease (CTRL/AD) and CTRL vs. 
Mild Cognitive Impairment who subsequently progressed to AD dementia 
(CTRL/MCI-co). We discuss the conditions on v and the added value of Λ in 
discriminating subjects.
RESULTS: The age-corrected bilateral annualized atrophy rate (%/year) were: -1.6 
(0.6) for CTRL, -2.2 (1.0) for MCI-nc, -3.2 (1.2) for MCI-co and -4.0 (1.5) for 
AD. Combined (v, Λ) discrimination ability gave an Area under the ROC curve 
(auc)=0.93 for CTRL vs AD and auc=0.88 for CTRL vs MCI-co.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal volume measurements can provide meaningful clinical 
insight and added value with respect to the baseline provided the analysis 
procedure embeds the longitudinal information.

BACKGROUND: The earliest stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
defined by low levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ42). However, 
covariance in longitudinal dynamic change of Aβ42 and tau in incipient 
preclinical AD is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To examine dynamic interrelationships between Aβ42 and tau in 
preclinical AD.
METHODS: We followed 47 cognitively intact participants (CI) with available CSF 
data over four years in ADNI. Based on longitudinal Aβ42 levels in CSF, CI were 
classified into three groups: 1) Aβ42 stable with normal levels of Aβ42 over 
time (n = 15); 2) Aβ42 declining with normal Aβ42 levels at baseline but showing 
decline over time (n = 14); and 3) Aβ42 levels consistently abnormal (n = 18).
RESULTS: In the Aβ42 declining group, suggestive of incipient preclinical AD, 
CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) showed a similar longitudinal pattern of 
increasing abnormality over time (p = 0.0001). Correlation between longitudinal 
slopes of Aβ42 and p-tau confirmed that both trajectories were anti-correlated 
(rho = -0.60; p = 0.02). Regression analysis showed that Aβ42 slope (decreasing 
Aβ42) predicted p-tau slope (increasing p-tau) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.03). Atrophy in 
the hippocampus was predicted by the interaction of Aβ42 and p-tau slopes (p < 
 0.0001) only in this incipient preclinical AD group. In all groups combined, 
memory decline was predicted by p-tau.
CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of Aβ42 and p-tau CSF biomarkers in CI subjects 
follows an anti-correlated trajectory, i.e., as Aβ42 declined, p-tau increased, 
and thus was suggestive of strong temporal coincidence. Rapid pathogenic 
cross-talk between Aβ42 and p-tau thus may be evident in very early stages of 
preclinical AD.

The irreversible and progressive atrophy by Alzheimer's Disease resulted in 
continuous decline in thinking and behavioral skills. To date, CNN classifiers 
were widely applied to assist the early diagnosis of AD and its associated 
abnormal structures. However, most existing black-box CNN classifiers relied 
heavily on the limited MRI scans, and used little domain knowledge from the 
previous clinical findings. In this study, we proposed a framework, named as 
PINet, to consider the previous domain knowledge as a Privileged Information 
(PI), and open the black-box in the prediction process. The input domain 
knowledge guides the neural network to learn representative features and 
introduced intepretability for further analysis. PINet used a Transformer-like 
fusion module Privileged Information Fusion (PIF) to iteratively calculate the 
correlation of the features between image features and PI features, and project 
the features into a latent space for classification. The Pyramid Feature 
Visualization (PFV) module served as a verification to highlight the significant 
features on the input images. PINet was suitable for neuro-imaging tasks and we 
demonstrated its application in Alzheimer's Disease using structural MRI scans 
from ADNI dataset. During the experiments, we employed the abnormal brain 
structures such as the Hippocampus as the PI, trained the model with the data 
from 1.5T scanners and tested from 3T scanners. The F1-score showed that PINet 
was more robust in transferring to a new dataset, with approximatedly 2% drop 
(from 0.9471 to 0.9231), while the baseline CNN methods had a 29% drop (from 
0.8679 to 0.6154). The performance of PINet was relied on the selection of the 
domain knowledge as the PI. Our best model was trained under the guidance of 12 
selected ROIs, major in the structures of Temporal Lobe and Occipital Lobe. In 
summary, PINet considered the domain knowledge as the PI to train the CNN model, 
and the selected PI introduced both interpretability and generalization ability 
to the black box CNN classifiers.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major dementia cause, lacks effective 
treatment. MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement using artificial 
intelligence offers new insights into early diagnosis and intervention in AD 
progression.
OBJECTIVE: This study, involving 483 AD patients, 756 patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 968 normal controls (NC), investigated the 
predictive capability of MRI-based hippocampus volume measurements for AD risk 
using artificial intelligence and evidence-based medicine.
METHODS: Utilizing data from ADNI and OASIS-brains databases, three 
convolutional neural networks (InceptionResNetv2, Densenet169, and SEResNet50) 
were employed for automated AD classification based on structural MRI imaging. A 
multitask deep learning model and a densely connected 3D convolutional network 
were utilized. Additionally, a systematic meta-analysis explored the value of 
MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement in predicting AD occurrence and 
progression, drawing on 23 eligible articles from PubMed and Embase databases.
RESULTS: InceptionResNetv2 outperformed other networks, achieving 99.75% 
accuracy and 100% AUC for AD-NC classification and 99.16% accuracy and 100% AUC 
for MCI-NC classification. Notably, at a 512×512 size, InceptionResNetv2 
demonstrated a classification accuracy of 94.29% and an AUC of 98% for AD-NC and 
97.31% accuracy and 98% AUC for MCI-NC.
CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that MRI-based hippocampal volume changes 
effectively predict AD onset and progression, facilitating early intervention 
and prevention.

BACKGROUND: Predicting cognition decline in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) is crucial for identifying high-risk individuals and 
implementing effective management. To improve predicting MCI-to-AD conversion, 
it is necessary to consider various factors using explainable machine learning 
(XAI) models which provide interpretability while maintaining predictive 
accuracy. This study used the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model with 
multimodal features to predict the conversion of MCI to AD during different 
follow-up periods while providing interpretability.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study is conducted with data obtained 
from the ADNI database, with records of 1042 MCI patients from 2006 to 2022 
included. The exposures included in this study were MRI biomarkers, cognitive 
scores, demographics, and clinical features. The main outcome was AD conversion 
from aMCI during follow-up. The EBM model was utilized to predict aMCI 
converting to AD based on three feature combinations, obtaining interpretability 
while ensuring accuracy. Meanwhile, the interaction effect was considered in the 
model. The three feature combinations were compared in different follow-up 
periods with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC. The global and 
local explanations are displayed by importance ranking and feature 
interpretability plots.
RESULTS: The five-years prediction accuracy reached 85% (AUC = 0.92) using both 
cognitive scores and MRI markers. Apart from accuracies, we obtained features' 
importance in different follow-up periods. In early stage of AD, the MRI markers 
play a major role, while for middle-term, the cognitive scores are more 
important. Feature risk scoring plots demonstrated insightful nonlinear 
interactive associations between selected factors and outcome. In one-year 
prediction, lower right inferior temporal volume (<9000) is significantly 
associated with AD conversion. For two-year prediction, low left inferior 
temporal thickness (<2) is most critical. For three-year prediction, higher FAQ 
scores (>4) is the most important. During four-year prediction, APOE4 is the 
most critical. For five-year prediction, lower right entorhinal volume (<1000) 
is the most critical feature.
CONCLUSIONS: The established glass-box model EBMs with multimodal features 
demonstrated a superior ability with detailed interpretability in predicting AD 
conversion from MCI. Multi features with significant importance were identified. 
Further study may be of significance to determine whether the established 
prediction tool would improve clinical management for AD patients.

Incorporating with machine learning technology, neuroimaging markers which 
extracted from structural Magnetic Resonance Images (sMRI), can help distinguish 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients from Healthy Controls (HC). In the present 
study, we aim to investigate differences in atrophic regions between HC and AD 
and apply machine learning methods to classify these two groups. T1-weighted 
sMRI scans of 158 patients with AD and 145 age-matched HC were acquired from the 
ADNI database. Five kinds of parameters (i.e. cortical thickness, surface area, 
gray matter volume, curvature and sulcal depth) were obtained through the 
preprocessing steps. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method for support 
vector machine (SVM) and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) were applied to 
determine the optimal feature dimensions. Each kind of parameter was trained by 
SVM algorithm to acquire a classifier, which was used to classify HC and AD 
ultimately. Moreover, the ROC curves were depicted for testing the classifiers' 
performance and the SVM classifiers of two-dimensional spaces took the top two 
important features as classification features for separating HC and AD to the 
maximum extent. The results showed that the decreased cortical thickness and 
gray matter volume dramatically exhibited the trend of atrophy. The key 
differences between AD and HC existed in the cortical thickness and gray matter 
volume of the entorhinal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. In terms of 
classification results, an optimal accuracy of 90.76% was obtained via 
multi-parameter combination (i.e. cortical thickness, gray matter volume and 
surface area). Meanwhile, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
area under the curve (AUC) were also verified multi-parameter combination could 
reach a better classification performance (AUC=0.94) after the SVM-RFE method. 
The results could be well prove that multi-parameter combination could provide 
more useful classified features from multivariate anatomical structure than 
single parameter. In addition, as cortical thickness and multi-parameter 
combination contained more important classified information with fewer feature 
dimensions after feature selection, it could be optimum to separate HC from AD 
to take the top two important features of them to construct SVM classifiers in 
two-dimensional space. The proposed work is a promising approach suggesting an 
important role for machine-learning based diagnostic image analysis for clinical 
practice.

Accurate diagnosis of the initial phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential 
and crucial. The objective of this research was to employ efficient biomarkers 
for the diagnostic analysis and classification of AD based on combining 
structural MRI (sMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). So far, 
several anatomical MRI imaging markers for AD diagnosis have been identified. 
The use of cortical and subcortical volumes, the hippocampus, and amygdala 
volume, as well as genetic patterns, has proven to be beneficial in 
distinguishing patients with AD from the healthy population. The fMRI time 
series data have the potential for specific numerical information as well as 
dynamic temporal information. Voxel and graphical analyses have gained 
popularity for analyzing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and its 
prodromal phase, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). So far, these approaches have 
been utilized separately for the diagnosis of AD. In recent studies, the 
classification of cases of MCI into those that are not converted for a certain 
period as stable MCI (MCIs) and those that converted to AD as MCIc has been less 
commonly reported with inconsistent results. In this study, we verified and 
validated the potency of a proposed diagnostic framework to identify AD and 
differentiate MCIs from MCIc by utilizing the efficient biomarkers obtained from 
sMRI, along with functional brain networks of the frequency range .01-.027 at 
the resting state and the voxel-based features. The latter mainly included 
default mode networks (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation [ALFF], fractional 
ALFF [ALFF], and regional homogeneity [ReHo]), degree centrality (DC), and 
salience networks (SN). Pearson's correlation coefficient for measuring fMRI 
functional networks has proven to be an efficient means for disease diagnosis. 
We applied the graph theory to calculate nodal features (nodal degree [ND], 
nodal path length [NL], and between centrality [BC]) as a graphical feature and 
analyzed the connectivity link between different brain regions. We extracted 
three-dimensional (3D) patterns to calculate regional coherence and then 
implement a univariate statistical t-test to access a 3D mask that preserves 
voxels showing significant changes. Similarly, from sMRI, we calculated the 
hippocampal subfield and amygdala nuclei volume using Freesurfer (version 6). 
Finally, we implemented and compared the different feature selection algorithms 
to integrate the structural features, brain networks, and voxel features to 
optimize the diagnostic identifications of AD using support vector machine (SVM) 
classifiers. We also compared the performance of SVM with Random Forest (RF) 
classifiers. The obtained results demonstrated the potency of our framework, 
wherein a combination of the hippocampal subfield, the amygdala volume, and 
brain networks with multiple measures of rs-fMRI could significantly enhance the 
accuracy of other approaches in diagnosing AD. The accuracy obtained by the 
proposed method was reported for binary classification. More importantly, the 
classification results of the less commonly reported MCIs vs. MCIc improved 
significantly. However, this research involved only the AD Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort to focus on the diagnosis of AD advancement by 
integrating sMRI and fMRI. Hence, the study's primary disadvantage is its small 
sample size. In this case, the dataset we utilized did not fully reflect the 
whole population. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our findings will be 
applicable to other populations.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
β-amyloid (Aβ) associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. The 
functional form to model the association between Aβ and regional brain atrophy 
has not been well defined. To determine the relationship between Aβ and atrophy, 
we compared the performance of the usual dichotomization of cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ to identify subjects as Aβ+ and Aβ- with a trilinear spline model of 
CSF Aβ.
METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
and 108 cognitively normal controls with baseline CSF Aβ and up to 4 years of 
longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed using mixed-effects regression. 
Piecewise-linear splines were used to evaluate the nonlinear nature of the 
association between CSF Aβ and regional atrophy and to identify points of 
acceleration of atrophy with respect to Aβ. Several parameterizations of CSF Aβ 
were compared using likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion. 
Periods of acceleration of atrophy in which subjects transition from CSF Aβ 
negativity to CSF Aβ positivity were estimated from the spline models and tested 
for significance.
RESULTS: Spline models resulted in better fits for many temporal and parietal 
regions compared with the dichotomous models. The trilinear model showed that 
periods of acceleration of atrophy varied greatly by region with early changes 
seen in the insula, amygdala, precuneus, hippocampus, and other temporal 
regions, occurring before the clinical threshold for CSF Aβ positivity.
DISCUSSION: The use of piecewise-linear splines provides an improved model of 
the nonlinear association between CSF Aβ and regional atrophy in regions 
implicated in the progression of AD. The important biological finding of this 
work is that some brain regions show periods of accelerated volume loss well 
before the CSF Aβ42 threshold. This implies that signs of brain atrophy develop 
before the current conventional definition of "preclinical AD".

Hippocampal atrophy measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are powerful 
tools for monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. In this paper, we 
introduce a longitudinal image analysis framework based on robust registration 
and simultaneous hippocampal segmentation and longitudinal marker classification 
of brain MRI of an arbitrary number of time points. The framework comprises two 
innovative parts: a longitudinal segmentation and a longitudinal classification 
step. The results show that both steps of the longitudinal pipeline improved the 
reliability and the accuracy of the discrimination between clinical groups. We 
introduce a novel approach to the joint segmentation of the hippocampus across 
multiple time points; this approach is based on graph cuts of longitudinal MRI 
scans with constraints on hippocampal atrophy and supported by atlases. 
Furthermore, we use linear mixed effect (LME) modeling for differential 
diagnosis between clinical groups. The classifiers are trained from the average 
residue between the longitudinal marker of the subjects and the LME model. In 
our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal markers from 
two publicly available datasets (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 
ADNI and Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease, MIRIAD). In 
test/retest reliability experiments, the proposed method yielded lower volume 
errors and significantly higher dice overlaps than the cross-sectional approach 
(volume errors: 1.55% vs 0.8%; dice overlaps: 0.945 vs 0.975). To diagnose AD, 
the discrimination ability of our proposal gave an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) [Formula: see text] 0.947 for the 
control vs AD, AUC [Formula: see text] 0.720 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
vs AD, and AUC [Formula: see text] 0.805 for the control vs MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that 
significantly impacts the quality of life of patients and their families. 
Neuroimaging-driven brain age prediction has been proposed as a potential 
biomarker to detect mental disorders, such as AD, aiding in studying its effects 
on functional brain networks. Previous studies have shown that individuals with 
AD display impaired resting-state functional connections. However, most studies 
on brain age prediction have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
with limited studies based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).
METHODS: In this study, we applied a graph neural network (GNN) model on 
controls to predict brain ages using rs-fMRI in patients with AD. We compared 
the performance of the GNN model with traditional machine learning models. 
Finally, the post hoc model was also used to identify the critical brain regions 
in AD.
RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrate that our GNN model can predict 
brain ages of normal controls using rs-fMRI data from the ADNI database. 
Moreover the differences between brain ages and chronological ages were more 
significant in AD patients than in normal controls. Our results also suggest 
that AD is associated with accelerated brain aging and that the GNN model based 
on resting-state functional connectivity is an effective tool for predicting 
brain age.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides evidence that rs-fMRI is a promising modality for 
brain age prediction in AD research, and the GNN model proves to be effective in 
predicting brain age. Furthermore, the effects of the hippocampus, 
parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala on brain age prediction are verified.

A symptom of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a 
flat learning profile. Learning slope calculation methods vary, and the optimal 
method for capturing neuroanatomical changes associated with MCI and early AD 
pathology is unclear. This study cross-sectionally compared four different 
learning slope measures from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (simple 
slope, regression-based slope, two-slope method, peak slope) to structural 
neuroimaging markers of early AD neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume, cortical 
thickness in parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, and lateral prefrontal cortex) 
across the cognitive aging spectrum [normal control (NC); (n=198; age=76±5), MCI 
(n=370; age=75±7), and AD (n=171; age=76±7)] in ADNI. Within diagnostic group, 
general linear models related slope methods individually to neuroimaging 
variables, adjusting for age, sex, education, and APOE4 status. Among MCI, 
better learning performance on simple slope, regression-based slope, and late 
slope (Trial 2-5) from the two-slope method related to larger parahippocampal 
thickness (all p-values<.01) and hippocampal volume (p<.01). Better 
regression-based slope (p<.01) and late slope (p<.01) were related to larger 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in MCI. No significant associations emerged 
between any slope and neuroimaging variables for NC (p-values ≥.05) or AD 
(p-values ≥.02). Better learning performances related to larger medial temporal 
lobe (i.e., hippocampal volume, parahippocampal gyrus thickness) and 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in MCI only. Regression-based and late slope 
were most highly correlated with neuroimaging markers and explained more 
variance above and beyond other common memory indices, such as total learning. 
Simple slope may offer an acceptable alternative given its ease of calculation.

BACKGROUND: Grey matter (GM) atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most 
commonly modeled as a function of time. However, this approach does not take 
into account inter-individual differences in initial disease severity or changes 
due to aging. Here, we modeled GM atrophy within individuals across the AD 
clinical spectrum as a function of time, aging and MMSE, as a proxy for disease 
severity, and investigated how these models influence estimates of GM atrophy.
METHODS: We selected 523 individuals from ADNI (100 preclinical AD, 288 
prodromal AD, 135 AD dementia) with abnormal baseline amyloid PET/CSF and 
≥1 year of MRI follow-up. We calculated total and 90 regional GM volumes for 
2281 MRI scans (median [IQR]; 4 [3-5] scans per individual over 2 [1.6-4] years) 
and used linear mixed models to investigate atrophy as a function of time, aging 
and decline on MMSE. Analyses included clinical stage as interaction with the 
predictor and were corrected for baseline age, sex, education, field strength 
and total intracranial volume. We repeated analyses for a sample of participants 
with normal amyloid (n = 387) to assess whether associations were specific for 
amyloid pathology.
RESULTS: Using time or aging as predictors, amyloid abnormal participants 
annually declined -1.29 ± 0.08 points and - 0.28 ± 0.03 points respectively on 
the MMSE and -12.23 ± 0.47 cm3 and -8.87 ± 0.34 respectively in total GM volume 
(p < .001). For the time and age models atrophy was widespread and preclinical 
and prodromal AD showed similar atrophy patterns. Comparing prodromal AD to AD 
dementia, AD dementia showed faster atrophy mostly in temporal lobes as modeled 
with time, while prodromal AD showed faster atrophy in mostly frontoparietal 
areas as modeled with age (pFDR < 0.05). Modeling change in GM volume as a 
function of decline on MMSE, slopes were less steep compared to those based on 
time and aging (-4.1 ± 0.25 cm3 per MMSE point decline; p < .001) and showed 
steeper atrophy for prodromal AD compared to preclinical AD in the right 
inferior temporal gyrus (p < .05) and compared to AD dementia mostly in temporal 
areas (pFDR < 0.05). Associations with time, aging and MMSE remained when 
accounting for these effects in the other models, suggesting that all measures 
explain part of the variance in GM atrophy. Repeating analyses in amyloid normal 
individuals, effects for time and aging showed similar widespread anatomical 
patterns, while associations with MMSE were largely reduced.
CONCLUSION: Effects of time, aging and MMSE all explained variance in GM atrophy 
slopes within individuals. Associations with MMSE were weaker than those for 
time or age, but specific for amyloid pathology. This suggests that at least 
some of the atrophy observed in time or age models may not be specific to AD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Assessment of ventricular enlargement is subjective and 
based on the radiologist's experience. Linear indices, such as the Evans Index 
(EI), have been proposed as markers of ventricular volume with an EI≥0.3 
indicating pathologic ventricular enlargement in any subject. However, normal 
range for EI measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are lacking in 
healthy elderly according to age and sex. We propose new age and sex specific 
cut-off values for ventricular enlargement in the elderly population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 534 participants (53% women) aged 65-84 years; 226 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 308 healthy elderly controls (CTR) 
from the AddNeuroMed and ADNI studies were included. The cut-off for 
pathological ventricular enlargement was estimated from healthy elderly 
categorized into age groups of 5 years range and defined as EI 97,5 percentile 
(mean+2SD). Cut-off values were tested on patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
a small sample of patients with probable idiopathic normal pressure 
hydrocephalus (iNPH) to assess the sensitivity.
RESULTS: The range of the EI in healthy elderly is wide and 29% of the CTR had 
an EI of 0.3 or greater. The EI increases with age in both CTR and AD, and the 
overall EI for women were lower than for men (p<0.001). New EI cut off values 
for male/female: 65-69 years 0.34/0.32, 70-74 years 0.36/0.33, 75-79 years 
0.37/0.34 and 80-84 years 0.37/0.36. When applying the proposed cut-offs for EI 
in men and women aged 65-84, they differentiated between iNPH and CTR with a 
sensitivity of 80% and for different age and sex categories of AD and CTR with a 
sensitivity and specificity of 0-27% and 91-98%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The range of the EI measurements in healthy elderly is wide, and a 
cut-off value of 0.3 cannot be used to differentiate between normal and enlarged 
ventricles in individual cases. The proposed EI thresholds from the present 
study show good sensitivity for the iNPH diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with 
the abnormal deposition of pathological processes, such as amyloid-ß and tau, 
which produces nonlinear changes in the functional connectivity patterns between 
different brain regions across the Alzheimer's disease continuum. However, the 
mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes remain largely unknown. Here, we 
address this question using a novel method based on temporal or delayed 
correlations and calculate new whole-brain functional networks to tackle these 
mechanisms.
METHODS: To assess our method, we evaluated 166 individuals from the ADNI 
database, including amyloid-beta negative and positive cognitively normal 
subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer's 
disease dementia. We used the clustering coefficient and the global efficiency 
to measure the functional network topology and assessed their relationship with 
amyloid and tau pathology measured by positron emission tomography, as well as 
cognitive performance using tests measuring memory, executive function, 
attention, and global cognition.
RESULTS: Our study found nonlinear changes in the global efficiency, but not in 
the clustering coefficient, showing that the nonlinear changes in functional 
connectivity are due to an altered ability of brain regions to communicate with 
each other through direct paths. These changes in global efficiency were most 
prominent in early disease stages. However, later stages of Alzheimer's disease 
were associated with widespread network disruptions characterized by changes in 
both network measures. The temporal delays required for the detection of these 
changes varied across the Alzheimer's disease continuum, with shorter delays 
necessary to detect changes in early stages and longer delays necessary to 
detect changes in late stages. Both global efficiency and clustering coefficient 
showed quadratic associations with pathological amyloid and tau burden as well 
as cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that global efficiency is a more sensitive 
indicator of network changes in Alzheimer's disease when compared to clustering 
coefficient. Both network properties were associated with pathology and 
cognitive performance, demonstrating their relevance in clinical settings. Our 
findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying nonlinear changes in 
functional network organization in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that it is 
the lack of direct connections that drives these functional changes.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has unveiled specific alterations 
at different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiologic continuum 
constituting what has been established as "AD signature". To what extent MRI can 
detect amyloid-related cerebral changes from structural MRI in cognitively 
unimpaired individuals is still an area open for exploration.
METHOD: Longitudinal 3D-T1 MRI scans were acquired from a subset of the ADNI 
cohort comprising 403 subjects: 79 controls (Ctrls), 50 preclinical AD (PreAD), 
and 274 MCI and dementia due to AD (MCI/AD). Amyloid CSF was used as 
gold-standard measure with established cutoffs (< 192 pg/mL) to establish 
diagnostic categories. Cognitively unimpaired individuals were defined as Ctrls 
if were amyloid negative and PreAD otherwise. The MCI/AD group was amyloid 
positive. Only subjects with the same diagnostic category at baseline and 
follow-up visits were considered for the study. Longitudinal morphometric 
analysis was performed using SPM12 to calculate Jacobian determinant maps. 
Statistical analysis was carried out on these Jacobian maps to identify 
structural changes that were significantly different between diagnostic 
categories. A machine learning classifier was applied on Jacobian determinant 
maps to predict the presence of abnormal amyloid levels in cognitively 
unimpaired individuals. The performance of this classifier was evaluated using 
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and as a function of the 
follow-up time between MRI scans. We applied a cost function to assess the 
benefit of using this classifier in the triaging of individuals in a clinical 
trial-recruitment setting.
RESULTS: The optimal follow-up time for classification of Ctrls vs PreAD was 
Δt > 2.5 years, and hence, only subjects within this temporal span are used for 
evaluation (15 Ctrls, 10 PreAD). The longitudinal voxel-based classifier 
achieved an AUC = 0.87 (95%CI 0.72-0.97). The brain regions that showed the 
highest discriminative power to detect amyloid abnormalities were the medial, 
inferior, and lateral temporal lobes; precuneus; caudate heads; basal forebrain; 
and lateral ventricles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work supports that machine learning applied to longitudinal 
brain volumetric changes can be used to predict, with high precision, the 
presence of amyloid abnormalities in cognitively unimpaired subjects. Used as a 
triaging method to identify a fixed number of amyloid-positive individuals, this 
longitudinal voxel-wise classifier is expected to avoid 55% of unnecessary CSF 
and/or PET scans and reduce economic cost by 40%.

INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal volume (HV) and cortical thickness are commonly used 
imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials, and may have utility as 
selection criteria for enrichment strategies. Atrophy rates of these measures, 
in the high-risk apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4/ε4 homozygous AD subjects are 
unknown.
METHODS: Data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) and a 
tramiprosate trial were analyzed in APOE ε4/ε4 and APOE ε3/ε3 subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data 
were centrally processed using FreeSurfer; total HV and composite average 
cortical thickness were derived and adjusted for age, head size, and education. 
Volumetric changes from baseline were assessed using Boundary Shift Integral, 
and correlated with cognitive changes.
RESULTS: APOE ε4/ε4 MCI subjects showed significantly higher % HV atrophy and 
cortical thinning at 12 months (4.4%, 3.1%, n = 29) compared to APOE ε3/ε3 
subjects (2.8%, 1.8%, n = 93) and similarly in mild AD (7.4%, 4.7% n = 21 vs 
5.4%, 3.3% n = 29). Differences were all significant at 24 months. Over 24 
months, HV atrophy and cortical thinning correlated significantly with 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale worsening in APOE ε4/ε4 
MCI subjects, but not in mild AD.
DISCUSSION: Correlation of volumetric measures to cognitive change in APOE ε4/ε4 
subjects with early AD supports their role as efficacy biomarkers. If confirmed 
in a Phase 3 trial with ALZ-801 (pro-drug of tramiprosate) in APOE ε4/ε4 early 
AD subjects, it may allow their use as surrogate outcomes in future treatment or 
prevention trials in AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people 
and increasing longevity ensures its prevalence will rise even further. Whether 
AD originates by disconnecting a localized brain area and propagates to the rest 
of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown 
answer. An important related challenge is to predict whether a given subject, 
with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), will convert or not to AD. Here, our aim 
is to characterize the structural connectivity pattern of MCI and AD subjects 
using the multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) analysis, and to 
compare it to those of healthy subjects. MDMR is a technique developed in 
genomics that has been recently applied to functional brain network data, and 
here applied to identify brain nodes with different connectivity patterns, in 
controls and patients, because of brain atrophy. We address this issue at the 
macroscale by looking to differences in individual structural MRI brain 
networks, obtained from MR images according to a recently proposed definition of 
connectivity which measures the image similarity between patches at different 
locations in the brain. In particular, using data from ADNI, we selected four 
groups of subjects (all of them matched by age and sex): HC (healthy control 
participants), ncMCI (mild cognitive impairment not converting to AD), cMCI 
(mild cognitive impairment converting to AD) and AD. Next, we built structural 
MRI brain networks and performed group comparison for all the pairs of groups. 
Our results were three-fold: (i) considering the comparison of HC with the three 
other groups, the number of significant brain regions was 4 for ncMCI, 290 for 
cMCI and 74 for AD, out of a total of 549 regions; hence, in terms of the 
structural MRI connectivity here adopted, cMCI subjects have the maximal altered 
pattern w.r.t. healthy conditions. (ii) Eight and seven nodes were significant 
for the comparisons AD-ncMCI and AD-cMCI, respectively; six nodes, among them, 
were significant in both comparisons and these nodes form a connected brain 
region (corresponding to hippocampus, amygdala, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Planum 
Polare, Frontal Orbital Cortex, Temporal Pole and subcallosal cortex) showing 
reduced strength of connectivity in the MCI stages; (iii) The connectivity maps 
of cMCI and ncMCI subjects significantly differ from the connectome of healthy 
subjects in three regions all corresponding to Frontal Orbital Cortex.

PURPOSE: Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images acquired from multisite 
and multivendor MRI scanners are widely used in measuring longitudinal 
structural changes in the brain. Precise and accurate measurements are important 
in understanding the natural progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease. However, geometric distortions in MRI images decrease the 
accuracy and precision of volumetric or morphometric measurements. To solve this 
problem, the authors suggest a commercially available phantom-based distortion 
correction method that accommodates the variation in geometric distortion within 
MRI images obtained with multivendor MRI scanners.
METHODS: The authors' method is based on image warping using a polynomial 
function. The method detects fiducial points within a phantom image using 
phantom analysis software developed by the Mayo Clinic and calculates warping 
functions for distortion correction. To quantify the effectiveness of the 
authors' method, the authors corrected phantom images obtained from multivendor 
MRI scanners and calculated the root-mean-square (RMS) of fiducial errors and 
the circularity ratio as evaluation values. The authors also compared the 
performance of the authors' method with that of a distortion correction method 
based on a spherical harmonics description of the generic gradient design 
parameters. Moreover, the authors evaluated whether this correction improves the 
test-retest reproducibility of voxel-based morphometry in human studies.
RESULTS: A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with uncorrected and corrected images was 
performed. The root-mean-square errors and circularity ratios for all slices 
significantly improved (p < 0.0001) after the authors' distortion correction. 
Additionally, the authors' method was significantly better than a distortion 
correction method based on a description of spherical harmonics in improving the 
distortion of root-mean-square errors (p < 0.001 and 0.0337, respectively). 
Moreover, the authors' method reduced the RMS error arising from gradient 
nonlinearity more than gradwarp methods. In human studies, the coefficient of 
variation of voxel-based morphometry analysis of the whole brain improved 
significantly from 3.46% to 2.70% after distortion correction of the whole gray 
matter using the authors' method (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors proposed a phantom-based distortion correction method 
to improve reproducibility in longitudinal structural brain analysis using 
multivendor MRI. The authors evaluated the authors' method for phantom images in 
terms of two geometrical values and for human images in terms of test-retest 
reproducibility. The results showed that distortion was corrected significantly 
using the authors' method. In human studies, the reproducibility of voxel-based 
morphometry analysis for the whole gray matter significantly improved after 
distortion correction using the authors' method.

The purpose of this project was to evaluate white matter degeneration and its 
impact on hippocampal structural connectivity in patients with amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment, non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's 
disease. We estimated white matter fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and 
hippocampal structural connectivity in two independent cohorts. The ADNI cohort 
included 108 subjects [25 cognitively normal, 21 amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment, 47 non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 15 Alzheimer's 
disease]. A second cohort included 34 subjects [15 cognitively normal and 19 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment] recruited in Montreal. All subjects 
underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment in addition to diffusion 
and T1 MRI. Individual fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were 
generated using FSL-DTIfit. In addition, hippocampal structural connectivity 
maps expressing the probability of connectivity between the hippocampus and 
cortex were generated using a pipeline based on FSL-probtrackX. Voxel-based 
group comparison statistics of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and 
hippocampal structural connectivity were estimated using Tract-Based Spatial 
Statistics. The proportion of abnormal to total white matter volume was 
estimated using the total volume of the white matter skeleton. We found that in 
both cohorts, amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients had 27-29% white 
matter volume showing higher mean diffusivity but no significant fractional 
anisotropy abnormalities. No fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity 
differences were observed between non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
patients and cognitively normal subjects. Alzheimer's disease patients had 66.3% 
of normalized white matter volume with increased mean diffusivity and 54.3% of 
the white matter had reduced fractional anisotropy. Reduced structural 
connectivity was found in the hippocampal connections to temporal, inferior 
parietal, posterior cingulate and frontal regions only in the Alzheimer's group. 
The severity of white matter degeneration appears to be higher in advanced 
clinical stages, supporting the construct that these abnormalities are part of 
the pathophysiological processes of Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Heterogeneity in downstream atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
predominantly investigated in relation to pathological hallmarks (Aβ, tau) and 
co-pathologies (cerebrovascular burden) independently. However, the proportional 
contribution of each pathology in determining atrophy pattern remains unclear. 
We assessed heterogeneity in atrophy using two recently conceptualized 
dimensions: typicality (typical AD atrophy at the center and deviant atypical 
atrophy on either extreme including limbic predominant to hippocampal sparing 
patterns) and severity (overall neurodegeneration spanning minimal atrophy to 
diffuse typical AD atrophy) in relation to Aβ, tau, and cerebrovascular burden.
METHODS: We included 149 Aβ + individuals on the AD continuum (cognitively 
normal, prodromal AD, AD dementia) and 163 Aβ- cognitively normal individuals 
from the ADNI. We modeled heterogeneity in MRI-based atrophy with 
continuous-scales of typicality (ratio of hippocampus to cortical volume) and 
severity (total gray matter volume). Partial correlation models investigated the 
association of typicality/severity with (a) Aβ (global Aβ PET centiloid), tau 
(global tau PET SUVR), cerebrovascular (total white matter hypointensity volume) 
burden (b) four cognitive domains (memory, executive function, language, 
visuospatial composites). Using multiple regression, we assessed the association 
of each pathological burden and typicality/severity with cognition.
RESULTS: (a) In the AD continuum, typicality (r = -0.31, p < 0.001) and severity 
(r = -0.37, p < 0.001) were associated with tau burden after controlling for Aβ, 
cerebrovascular burden and age. Findings imply greater tau pathology in limbic 
predominant atrophy and diffuse atrophy. (b) Typicality was associated with 
memory (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and language scores (r = 0.19, p = 0.02). Severity 
was associated with memory (r = 0.26, p < 0.001), executive function (r = 0.24, 
p = 0.003) and language scores (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). Findings imply better 
cognitive performance in hippocampal sparing and minimal atrophy patterns. 
Beyond typicality/severity, tau burden but not Aβ and cerebrovascular burden 
explained cognition.
CONCLUSION: In the AD continuum, atrophy-based severity was more strongly 
associated with tau burden than typicality after accounting for Aβ and 
cerebrovascular burden. Cognitive performance in memory, executive function and 
language domains was explained by typicality and/or severity and additionally 
tau pathology. Typicality and severity may differentially reflect burden arising 
from tau pathology but not Aβ or cerebrovascular pathologies which need to be 
accounted for when investigating AD heterogeneity.

Multi-atlas patch-based label fusion methods have been successfully used to 
improve segmentation accuracy in many important medical image analysis 
applications. In general, to achieve label fusion a single target image is first 
registered to several atlas images. After registration a label is assigned to 
each target point in the target image by determining the similarity between the 
underlying target image patch (centered at the target point) and the aligned 
image patch in each atlas image. To achieve the highest level of accuracy during 
the label fusion process it's critical for the chosen patch similarity 
measurement to accurately capture the tissue/shape appearance of the anatomical 
structure. One major limitation of existing state-of-the-art label fusion 
methods is that they often apply a fixed size image patch throughout the entire 
label fusion procedure. Doing so may severely affect the fidelity of the patch 
similarity measurement, which in turn may not adequately capture complex tissue 
appearance patterns expressed by the anatomical structure. To address this 
limitation, we advance state-of-the-art by adding three new label fusion 
contributions: First, each image patch is now characterized by a multi-scale 
feature representation that encodes both local and semi-local image information. 
Doing so will increase the accuracy of the patch-based similarity measurement. 
Second, to limit the possibility of the patch-based similarity measurement being 
wrongly guided by the presence of multiple anatomical structures in the same 
image patch, each atlas image patch is further partitioned into a set of 
label-specific partial image patches according to the existing labels. Since 
image information has now been semantically divided into different patterns, 
these new label-specific atlas patches make the label fusion process more 
specific and flexible. Lastly, in order to correct target points that are 
mislabeled during label fusion, a hierarchical approach is used to improve the 
label fusion results. In particular, a coarse-to-fine iterative label fusion 
approach is used that gradually reduces the patch size. To evaluate the accuracy 
of our label fusion approach, the proposed method was used to segment the 
hippocampus in the ADNI dataset and 7.0 T MR images, sub-cortical regions in 
LONI LBPA40 dataset, mid-brain regions in SATA dataset from MICCAI 2013 
segmentation challenge, and a set of key internal gray matter structures in IXI 
dataset. In all experiments, the segmentation results of the proposed 
hierarchical label fusion method with multi-scale feature representations and 
label-specific atlas patches are more accurate than several well-known 
state-of-the-art label fusion methods.
