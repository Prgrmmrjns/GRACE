BACKGROUND: Frailty is a vulnerability state increasing the risk of many adverse 
health outcomes, but little is known about the effects of frailty on 
neuropsychiatric health.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between frailty and the risk of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in its 
different clinical stages.
METHODS: We included 2,155 individuals assessed using modified frailty index-11 
(mFI-11), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire (NPI-Q) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
The relationships between frailty and NPSs were explored with logistic 
regression models and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Causal 
mediation analyses were conducted to explore the mediation factors between 
frailty and NPSs.
RESULTS: Among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, frailty was 
cross-sectionally associated with an increased risk of apathy, and 
longitudinally associated with increased risk of depression and apathy. Among AD 
participants, frailty was cross-sectionally associated with increased risk of 
depression and anxiety, and longitudinally associated with an increased risk of 
apathy. Among participants with cognitive progression, frailty was associated 
with increased risk of depression and apathy. In MCI participants, the influence 
of frailty on NPSs was partially mediated by hippocampus volume, whole brain 
volume, and monocytes, with mediating proportions ranging from 8.40% to 9.29%.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with NPSs such as depression, anxiety, and 
apathy among MCI, AD, and cognitive progression participants. Atrophy of the 
hippocampus and whole brain, as well as peripheral immunity may be involved in 
the potential mechanisms underlying the above associations.

The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is commonly used to assess cognitive decline 
in Alzheimer's disease patients and is included in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We divided 741 ADNI participants with 
blood microarray data into three groups based on their most recent CDR 
assessment: cognitive normal (CDR = 0), mild cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5), 
and probable Alzheimer's disease (CDR ≥ 1.0). We then used machine learning to 
predict cognitive status using only blood RNA levels. Only one probe for 
chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) was significant after correction. 
However, by combining individually nonsignificant probes with p-values less than 
0.1, we averaged 87.87% (s = 1.02) predictive accuracy for classifying the three 
groups, compared to a 55.46% baseline for this study due to unequal group sizes. 
The best model had an overall precision of 0.902, recall of 0.895, and a 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.904. Although we 
identified one significant probe in CLIC1, CLIC1 levels alone were not 
sufficient to predict dementia status and cannot be used alone in a clinical 
setting. Additional analyses combining individually suggestive, but 
nonsignificant, blood RNA levels were significantly predictive and may improve 
diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we propose that patient 
features that do not individually predict cognitive status might still 
contribute to overall cognitive decline through interactions that can be 
elucidated through machine learning.

OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in subjects with MCI and 
associated with higher risk of progression to AD. The cognitive and 
neuroanatomical correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI have not been 
fully elucidated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the association between 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, regional tau deposition, and 
brain volumes in MCI subjects.
METHODS: A total of 233 MCI and 305 healthy comparisons were selected from the 
ADNI-3 cohort. All the subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological 
assessment, volumetric MR brain scan, and Flortaucipir PET for in vivo 
assessment of regional tau deposition. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
was evaluated by means of the NPI questionnaire. Multivariate analyses of 
variance were used to detect differences in cognitive and imaging markers in MCI 
subjects with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms.
RESULTS: 61.4% MCI subjects showed at least one neuropsychiatric symptom, with 
the most prevalent ones being depression (26.1%), irritability (23.6%), and 
sleep disturbances (23.6%). There was a significant effect of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms on cognitive tests of frontal and executive functions. MCI subjects 
with neuropsychiatric symptoms showed reduced brain volumes in the orbitofrontal 
and posterior cingulate cortices, while no effects were detected on regional tau 
deposition. Posterior cingulate cortex volume was the only predictor of global 
neuropsychiatric burden in this MCI population.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur early in the AD trajectory and are 
mainly related to defects of control executive abilities and to the reduction of 
gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortices. A 
better understanding of the cognitive and neuroanatomical mechanisms of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI could help develop more targeted and 
efficacious treatment alternatives.

PURPOSE: Brain aging is a complex and heterogeneous process characterized by 
both structural and functional decline. This study aimed to establish a novel 
deep learning (DL) method for predicting brain age by utilizing structural and 
metabolic imaging data.
METHODS: The dataset comprised participants from both the Universal Medical 
Imaging Diagnostic Center (UMIDC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). The former recruited 395 normal control (NC) subjects, while 
the latter included 438 NC subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
subjects, and 56 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. We developed a novel 
dual-pathway, 3D simple fully convolutional network (Dual-SFCNeXt) to estimate 
brain age using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG 
PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images of NC subjects as 
input. Several prevailing DL models were trained and tested using either MRI or 
PET data for comparison. Model accuracies were evaluated using mean absolute 
error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Brain age gap (BAG), 
deviations of brain age from chronologic age, was correlated with cognitive 
assessments in MCI and AD subjects.
RESULTS: Both PET- and MRI-based models achieved high prediction accuracy. The 
leading model was the SFCNeXt (the single-pathway version) for PET (MAE = 2.92, 
r = 0.96) and MRI (MAE = 3.23, r = 0.95) on all samples. By integrating both PET 
and MRI images, the Dual-SFCNeXt demonstrated significantly improved accuracy 
(MAE = 2.37, r = 0.97) compared to all single-modality models. Significantly 
higher BAG was observed in both the AD (P < 0.0001) and MCI (P < 0.0001) groups 
compared to the NC group. BAG correlated significantly with Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores (r=-0.390 for AD, r=-0.436 for MCI) and the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores (r = 0.333 for AD, r = 0.372 
for MCI).
CONCLUSION: The integration of [18F]FDG PET with structural MRI enhances the 
accuracy of brain age prediction, potentially introducing a new avenue for 
related multimodal brain age prediction studies.

BACKGROUND: The clinical meaningfulness of the effects of recently approved 
disease-modifying treatments (DMT) in Alzheimer's disease is under debate. 
Available evidence is limited to short-term effects on clinical rating scales 
which may be difficult to interpret and have limited intrinsic meaning to 
patients. The main value of DMTs accrues over the long term as they are expected 
to cause a delay or slowing of disease progression. While awaiting such 
evidence, the translation of short-term effects to time delays or slowing of 
progression could offer a powerful and readily interpretable representation of 
clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We simulated disease progression trajectories representing two arms, 
active and placebo, of a hypothetical clinical trial of a DMT. The placebo arm 
was simulated based on estimated mean trajectories of clinical dementia rating 
scale-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) recordings from amyloid-positive subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). The active arm was simulated to show an average slowing of disease 
progression versus placebo of 20% at each visit. The treatment effects in the 
simulated trials were estimated with a progression model for repeated measures 
(PMRM) and a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) for comparison. For PMRM, 
the treatment effect is expressed in units of time (e.g., days) and for MMRM in 
units of the outcome (e.g., CDR-SB points). PMRM results were implemented in a 
health economics Markov model extrapolating disease progression and death over 
15 years.
RESULTS: The PMRM model estimated a 19% delay in disease progression at 
18 months and 20% (~ 7 months delay) at 36 months, while the MMRM model 
estimated a 25% reduction in CDR-SB (~ 0.5 points) at 36 months. The PMRM model 
had slightly greater power compared to MMRM. The health economic model based on 
the estimated time delay suggested an increase in life expectancy (10 months) 
without extending time in severe stages of disease.
CONCLUSION: PMRM methods can be used to estimate treatment effects in terms of 
slowing of progression which translates to time metrics that can be readily 
interpreted and appreciated as meaningful outcomes for patients, care partners, 
and health care practitioners.

INTRODUCTION: We investigate the role of osteopontin (OPN) in participants with 
Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
in AD brains.
METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) OPN, AD, and synaptic biomarker levels were 
measured in 109 cognitively unimpaired (CU), parental-history positive 
Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer's 
Disease (PREVENT-AD) participants, and in 167 CU and 399 participants with MCI 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. OPN levels 
were examined as a function of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau positivity. Survival 
analyses investigated the link between OPN and rate of conversion to AD.
RESULTS: In PREVENT-AD, CSF OPN was positively correlated with synaptic 
biomarkers. In PREVENT-AD and ADNI, OPN was elevated in CSF Aβ42/40(+)/total 
tau(+) and CSF Aβ42/40(+)/phosphorylated tau181(+) individuals. In ADNI, OPN was 
increased in Aβ(+) positron emission tomography (PET) and tau(+) PET 
individuals, and associated with an accelerated rate of conversion to AD. OPN 
was elevated in autopsy-confirmed AD brains.
DISCUSSION: Strong associations between CSF OPN and key markers of AD 
pathophysiology suggest a significant role for OPN in tau neurobiology, 
particularly in the early stages of the disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: In the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel 
Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease cohort, we discovered that cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) osteopontin (OPN) levels can indicate early synaptic dysfunction, 
tau deposition, and neuronal loss in cognitively unimpaired elderly with a 
parental history. CSF OPN is elevated in amyloid beta(+) positron emission 
tomography (PET) and tau(+) PET individuals. Elevated CSF OPN is associated with 
an accelerated rate of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated CSF OPN 
is associated with an accelerated rate of cognitive decline on the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale 13, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes. 
OPN mRNA and protein levels are significantly upregulated in the frontal cortex 
of autopsy-confirmed AD brains.

Background: This study examines the relationship between delusional severity in 
cognitively impaired adults with automatically computed volume and texture 
biomarkers from the Normal Appearing Brain Matter (NABM) in FLAIR MRI. Methods: 
Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 24) and Alzheimer’s Disease 
(AD, n = 18) with delusions of varying severities based on Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) (1—mild, 2—moderate, 3—severe) from the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed for this task. 
The NABM region, which is gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) combined, was 
automatically segmented in FLAIR MRI volumes with intensity standardization and 
thresholding. Three imaging biomarkers were computed from this region, including 
NABM volume and two texture markers called “Integrity” and “Damage”. Together, 
these imaging biomarkers quantify structural changes in brain volume, 
microstructural integrity and tissue damage. Multivariable regression was used 
to investigate relationships between imaging biomarkers and delusional 
severities (1, 2 and 3). Sex, age, education, APOE4 and baseline cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) tau were included as co-variates. Results: Biomarkers were extracted 
from a total of 42 participants with longitudinal time points representing 164 
imaging volumes. Significant associations were found for all three NABM 
biomarkers between delusion level 3 and level 1. Integrity was also sensitive 
enough to show differences between delusion level 1 and delusion level 2. A 
significant specified interaction was noted with severe delusions (level 3) and 
CSF tau for all imaging biomarkers (p < 0.01). APOE4 homozygotes were also 
significantly related to the biomarkers. Conclusion: Cognitively impaired older 
adults with more severe delusions have greater global brain disease burden in 
the WM and GM combined (NABM) as measured using FLAIR MRI. Relative to patients 
with mild delusions, tissue degeneration in the NABM was more pronounced in 
subjects with higher delusional symptoms, with a significant association with 
CSF tau. Future studies are required to establish potential tau-associated 
mechanisms of increased delusional severity.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs), mainly caused by cerebrovascular injury, 
may lead to cognitive impairment. In order to identify whether the volume of 
WMHs is associated with cognitive decline over years, this longitudinal study 
involved 818 individuals from the ADNI-2 dataset from August 2010 to May 2017. 
Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of WMHs with 8 cognitive domains 
were explored, using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDRSB), Alzheimer 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog13), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning 
Test (RAVLT), Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), executive function 
(ADNI-EF), and memory function (ADNI-Mem). The association analyses were 
performed using multiple linear regression models, linear mixed models, Spearman 
rank correlation, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The volumes of WMHs were 
greater in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia compared with 
controls (p < 0.001) and mild cognitive impairment (p = 0.006) patients at 
baseline. The bigger volumes of WMHs correlated with worse performances on 
ADAS-Cog13 and ADNI-EF (p = 0.029; p = 0.003) at baseline and MMSE, MoCA, CDRSB, 
ADAS-Cog13, FAQ, and ADNI-Mem (overall p < 0.05) longitudinally, after adjusting 
for age, sex, educational level, apolipoprotein E ɛ4 genotype, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, infarction, and diagnosis. Additionally, the 
correlations between the change rate of WMHs and change rates of MMSE, MoCA, 
CDRSB, FAQ, ADNI-EF, and ADNI-Mem were statistically significant. Furthermore, 
patients with high WMH volumes showed an increased likelihood of dementia. The 
results of the study suggest that WMH volume is associated with cognitive 
decline, and it contributes to the conversion to AD.

BACKGROUND: Due to the class imbalance issue faced when Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
develops from normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), present 
clinical practice is met with challenges regarding the auxiliary diagnosis of AD 
using machine learning (ML). This leads to low diagnosis performance. We aimed 
to construct an interpretable framework, extreme gradient boosting-Shapley 
additive explanations (XGBoost-SHAP), to handle the imbalance among different AD 
progression statuses at the algorithmic level. We also sought to achieve 
multiclassification of NC, MCI, and AD.
METHODS: We obtained patient data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, including clinical information, neuropsychological 
test results, neuroimaging-derived biomarkers, and APOE-ε4 gene statuses. First, 
three feature selection algorithms were applied, and they were then included in 
the XGBoost algorithm. Due to the imbalance among the three classes, we changed 
the sample weight distribution to achieve multiclassification of NC, MCI, and 
AD. Then, the SHAP method was linked to XGBoost to form an interpretable 
framework. This framework utilized attribution ideas that quantified the impacts 
of model predictions into numerical values and analysed them based on their 
directions and sizes. Subsequently, the top 10 features (optimal subset) were 
used to simplify the clinical decision-making process, and their performance was 
compared with that of a random forest (RF), Bagging, AdaBoost, and a naive Bayes 
(NB) classifier. Finally, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) 
dataset was employed to assess the impact path consistency of the features 
within the optimal subset.
RESULTS: Compared to the RF, Bagging, AdaBoost, NB and XGBoost (unweighted), the 
interpretable framework had higher classification performance with accuracy 
improvements of 0.74%, 0.74%, 1.46%, 13.18%, and 0.83%, respectively. The 
framework achieved high sensitivity (81.21%/74.85%), specificity 
(92.18%/89.86%), accuracy (87.57%/80.52%), area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) (0.91/0.88), positive clinical utility index 
(0.71/0.56), and negative clinical utility index (0.75/0.68) on the ADNI and 
NACC datasets, respectively. In the ADNI dataset, the top 10 features were found 
to have varying associations with the risk of AD onset based on their SHAP 
values. Specifically, the higher SHAP values of CDRSB, ADAS13, ADAS11, ventricle 
volume, ADASQ4, and FAQ were associated with higher risks of AD onset. 
Conversely, the higher SHAP values of LDELTOTAL, mPACCdigit, RAVLT_immediate, 
and MMSE were associated with lower risks of AD onset. Similar results were 
found for the NACC dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed interpretable framework contributes to achieving 
excellent performance in imbalanced AD multiclassification tasks and provides 
scientific guidance (optimal subset) for clinical decision-making, thereby 
facilitating disease management and offering new research ideas for optimizing 
AD prevention and treatment programs.

Major depressive disorder is a common debilitating disorder that is associated 
with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the molecular mechanism 
underlying depression remains largely unknown. The current study investigated 
the association of depression with blood gene expression using data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Depression was measured by 
the geriatric depression scale, and the blood gene expression was measured by 
the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array. Linear regression was used to test the 
association between gene expression and depression, and the model was adjusted 
for age and sex. A total of 671 participants were included in our study (mean 
age 75 ± 8 years, 43.2% women). We found three genes were associated with 
depression, including COL1A2 (P = 8.9 × 10-8), RNF150 (P = 1.4 × 10-7) and CTGF 
(P = 8.3 × 10-7). An interaction network was built, and the pathway analysis 
indicated that many depression-related genes were involved in the neurotrophin 
signaling pathway (P = 2.1 × 10-7). Future studies are necessary to validate our 
findings and further investigate potential mechanism of depression.

BACKGROUND: Assessing the risk of developing clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia, by machine learning survival analysis approaches, among participants 
registered in Alzheimer's Disease Centers is important for AD dementia 
management.
OBJECTIVE: To construct a prediction model for the onset time of clinical AD 
dementia using the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) registered cohorts.
METHODS: A model was constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) approach 
and internally and externally validated on the NACC cohort and the ADNI cohort. 
An R package and a Shiny app were provided for accessing the model.
RESULTS: We built a predictive model having the six predictors: delayed logical 
memory score (story recall), CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument - Sum of Boxes, 
general orientation in CDR®, ability to remember dates and ability to pay bills 
in the Functional Activities Questionnaire, and patient age. The C indices of 
the model were 90.82% (SE = 0.71%) and 86.51% (SE = 0.75%) in NACC and ADNI 
respectively. The time-dependent AUC and accuracy at 48 months were 92.48% 
(SE = 1.12%) and 88.66% (SE = 1.00%) respectively in NACC, and 90.16% 
(SE = 1.12%) and 85.00% (SE = 1.14%) respectively in ADNI.
CONCLUSION: The model showed good prediction performance and the six predictors 
were easy to obtain, cost-effective, and non-invasive. The model could be used 
to inform clinicians and patients on the probability of developing clinical AD 
dementia in 4 years with high accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) 
distinguishes pathology-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal cognition 
(NC) adults, to test if p-tau181 predicts cognitive and functional decline, and 
to validate findings in an external cohort.
METHODS: Thirty-one neuropathology-confirmed AD cases, participants with 
clinical diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 91) or AD dementia 
(N = 64), and NC (N = 241) had plasma collected at study entry. The clinical 
diagnosis groups had annual cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) and 
functional (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, CDR) measures. NC (N = 70), MCI 
(N = 75), and AD dementia (N = 50) cases from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used as a validation cohort. Plasma p-tau181 
was measured using the Quanterix SiMoA HD-X platform.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau181 differentiated pathology-confirmed AD from NC with 
negative amyloid PET scans with an AUC of 0.93. A cut point of 3.44 pg/mL 
(maximum Youden Index) had a sensitivity of 0.77, specificity of 0.96. p-Tau181 
values above the cut point were associated with the faster rate of decline in 
MMSE in AD dementia and MCI and a shorter time to a clinically significant 
functional decline in all groups. In a subset of MCI cases from ADNI, p-tau181 
values above the cut point associated with faster rate of decline in MMSE, and a 
shorter time to a clinically significant functional decline and conversion to 
dementia.
INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau181 differentiates AD pathology cases from NC with 
high accuracy. Higher levels of plasma p-tau181 are associated with faster 
cognitive and functional decline.

Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that 
uniquely enables the identification of subgroups of individuals with distinct 
pseudo-temporal disease progression patterns from cross-sectional datasets. 
SuStaIn has been used to identify data-driven subgroups and perform patient 
stratification in neurodegenerative diseases and in lung diseases from 
continuous biomarker measurements predominantly obtained from imaging. However, 
the SuStaIn algorithm is not currently applicable to discrete ordinal data, such 
as visual ratings of images, neuropathological ratings, and clinical and 
neuropsychological test scores, restricting the applicability of SuStaIn to a 
narrower range of settings. Here we propose 'Ordinal SuStaIn', an ordinal 
version of the SuStaIn algorithm that uses a scored events model of disease 
progression to enable the application of SuStaIn to ordinal data. We demonstrate 
the validity of Ordinal SuStaIn by benchmarking the performance of the algorithm 
on simulated data. We further demonstrate that Ordinal SuStaIn out-performs the 
existing continuous version of SuStaIn (Z-score SuStaIn) on discrete scored 
data, providing much more accurate subtype progression patterns, better 
subtyping and staging of individuals, and accurate uncertainty estimates. We 
then apply Ordinal SuStaIn to six different sub-scales of the Clinical Dementia 
Rating scale (CDR) using data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) study to identify individuals with distinct patterns of 
functional decline. Using data from 819 ADNI1 participants we identified three 
distinct CDR subtype progression patterns, which were independently verified 
using data from 790 ADNI2 participants. Our results provide insight into 
patterns of decline in daily activities in Alzheimer's disease and a mechanism 
for stratifying individuals into groups with difficulties in different domains. 
Ordinal SuStaIn is broadly applicable across different types of ratings data, 
including visual ratings from imaging, neuropathological ratings and clinical or 
behavioural ratings data.

BACKGROUND: Depression in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common, 
distressing, difficult to treat, and inadequately understood. It occurs more 
frequently in AD than in older adults without dementia. The reasons why some 
patients develop depression during AD and others do not remain obscure.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize depression in AD and to identify risk 
factors.
METHODS: We used data from three large dementia focused cohorts: ADNI (n = 665 
with AD, 669 normal cognition), NACC (n = 698 with AD, 711 normal cognition), 
and BDR (n = 757 with AD). Depression ratings were available using the GDS and 
NPI and in addition for BDR the Cornell. A cut-off of≥8 was used for the GDS and 
the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia,≥6 for the NPI depression 
sub-scale, and≥2 for the NPI-Q depression sub-scale. We used logistic regression 
to examine potential risk factors and random effects meta-analysis and an 
interaction term to look for interactions between each risk factor and the 
presence of cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: In individual studies there was no evidence of a difference in risk 
factors for depressive symptoms in AD. In the meta-analysis the only risk factor 
which increased the risk of depressive symptoms in AD was previous depression, 
but information on this was only available from one study (OR 7.78 95% CI 
4.03-15.03).
CONCLUSION: Risk factors for depression in AD appear to differ to those for 
depression per se supporting suggestions of a different pathological process, 
although a past history of depression was the strongest individual risk factor.

There is strong interest in developing predictive models to better understand 
individual heterogeneity and disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
have built upon previous longitudinal AD progression models, using a nonlinear, 
mixed-effect modeling approach to predict Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum 
of Boxes (CDR-SB) progression. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (observational study) and placebo arms from four interventional 
trials (N = 1093) were used for model building. The placebo arms from two 
additional interventional trials (N = 805) were used for external model 
validation. In this modeling framework, CDR-SB progression over the disease 
trajectory timescale was obtained for each participant by estimating disease 
onset time (DOT). Disease progression following DOT was described by both global 
progression rate (RATE) and individual progression rate (α). Baseline 
Mini-Mental State Examination and CDR-SB scores described the interindividual 
variabilities in DOT and α well. This model successfully predicted outcomes in 
the external validation datasets, supporting its suitability for prospective 
prediction and use in design of future trials. By predicting individual 
participants' disease progression trajectories using baseline characteristics 
and comparing these against the observed responses to new agents, the model can 
help assess treatment effects and support decision making for future trials.

IMPORTANCE: The emergence of psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) is 
associated with accelerated cognitive and functional decline that may be related 
to disease pathology.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the longitudinal dynamics of plasma tau phosphorylated 
at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels 
in association with the emergence of psychotic symptoms (delusions and 
hallucinations) in the context of AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used longitudinal data from 
the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Baseline analyses compared 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (both with psychosis [AD+P] 
and without psychosis [AD-P]) and participants who were cognitively unimpaired 
(CU). For the longitudinal analysis, participants with MCI and AD were 
subdivided into patients with evidence of psychosis at baseline (AD+P baseline) 
and patients free of psychosis at baseline who showed incidence of psychosis 
over the course of the study (AD+P incident). Study data were analyzed between 
June and November 2023.
EXPOSURES: Plasma p-tau181 and NfL measures in individuals with MCI and AD, both 
with and without psychosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma p-tau181 and NfL quantifications up to 48 
months and concurrent assessments of presence or absence of delusions and 
hallucinations via the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questionnaire.
RESULTS: The cohort included 752 participants with AD (mean [SD] age, 74.2 [7.7] 
years; 434 male [57.7%]). A total of 424 CU participants had a mean (SD) age of 
75.4 (6.6) years of whom 222 were female (52.4%). In the longitudinal analysis 
of p-tau181 trajectories of the AD+P group, the group of patients who showed 
incidence of psychosis over the course of follow-up (AD+P incident) demonstrated 
an associated increase in plasma p-tau181 levels compared with the group of 
patients who had psychosis at baseline (AD+P baseline) and showed an associated 
decrease in plasma p-tau181 levels (F4, 117 = 3.24; P = .01). The mean slope of 
p-tau181 change was significantly different in AD+P incident and AD+P baseline 
groups (F5,746 = 86.76, P < .0001) and when only individuals with amyloid-β 
positivity (Aβ+), which was determined using positron emission tomography, were 
compared (F5,455 = 84.60, P < .001). Patients who experienced psychosis at any 
time had increased levels of NfL relative to those who never experienced 
psychosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that the 
emergence of psychosis in AD was associated with elevations in plasma levels of 
p-tau181, highlighting the potential utility of plasma p-tau181 as a biomarker 
of neuropsychiatric illness in AD, which could have implications for predictive 
and treatment response strategies.

Young-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease has different clinical 
presentations with late-onset presenting most often with memory deficits while 
young-onset often presents with a non-amnestic syndrome. However, it is unknown 
whether there are differences in presentation and progression of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in young- versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease. We 
aimed to investigate differences in the prevalence and severity of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with young- and late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease longitudinally with and without accounting for the effect of medication 
usage. Sex differences were also considered in these patient groups. We included 
126 young-onset and 505 late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients from National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center-Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS) and Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We investigated the prevalence and 
severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory-Questionnaire over 4 visits with 1-year intervals, using a linear 
mixed-effects model. The prevalence of depression was significantly higher in 
young-onset than late-onset Alzheimer's disease over a 4-year interval when 
antidepressant usage was included in our analyses. Our findings suggest that 
neuropsychiatric symptom profiles of young- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
differ cross-sectionally but also display significant differences in 
progression.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) is a tool 
developed to detect clinical progression and measure treatment effect in 
patients in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The psychometric 
properties of the ADCOMS have been established; however, the threshold for 
clinical meaningfulness has yet to be identified.
METHODS: Anchor-based, distribution-based, and ROC curve analyses were used to 
estimate clinically meaningful thresholds for change in ADCOMS for patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. This study included data from 
three sources: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the 
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), and a legacy dataset that 
included data from four sources: the placebo group from three MCI trials and an 
earlier data cut from ADNI. Results were stratified by disease severity (MCI vs. 
dementia) and APOE ε4 carrier status.
RESULTS: A total of 5355 participants were included in the analysis. The ADCOMS 
was able to detect change for MCI and dementia patients who experienced a 
meaningful decline in cognition (as defined by the Clinical Dementia Rating 
Scale Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB]) between baseline and month 12. The following 
ADCOMS cut-offs were proposed: 0.05 for MCI and 0.10 for dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: The ADCOMS was previously established as a valid and reliable tool 
for use in clinical trials for MCI due to AD and dementia populations. By 
defining thresholds for clinically meaningful change of ADCOMS, this work is an 
important step in interpreting clinical findings and estimates of treatment 
effects in early stage AD trials.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are both common in mild cognitive 
impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD). Studies have shown that some NPS such as 
apathy and depression are a key indicator for progression to AD.
METHODS: We compared Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and NPI 
subdomain score between mild cognitive impairment-converters (MCI-C) and mild 
cognitive impairment-nonconverters (MCI-NC) longitudinally for 6 years using the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. In addition to the 
NPI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were also compared to find out 
if MMSE scores would differ between different NPI groups. Lastly, a linear 
regression model was done on MMSE and NPI total score to establish a 
relationship between MMSE and NPI total score.
RESULTS: The results in this study showed that NPI total scores between MCI-C 
and MCI-NC differed significantly throughout 6 years. MCI-C subjects had a 
higher mean NPI total score and lower MMSE score compared with MCI-NC subjects. 
In addition, MMSE scores were significantly different between the 3 groups of 
NPI total score. Subjects who have a high NPI score have the lowest mean MMSE 
score, thus demonstrating that NPI scores do indeed affect MMSE scores. Further 
analyses using a regression model revealed that a unit change in NPI total score 
lead to 0.1 to 0.3 decrease in MMSE.
DISCUSSION: On the basis of the findings, this study showed evidence that 
increase in NPS burden (reflected by increase in NPI) over time predicts 
conversion to AD, whereas stability of symptoms (reflected by stable NPI score) 
favors nonconversion. Further study should investigate the underlying mechanisms 
that drive both NPS burden and cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Depression in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common, 
difficult to treat and inadequately understood. Previous studies have identified 
possible differences in regional brain atrophy in individuals with AD and 
depression, but the results have been inconsistent and some studies had less 
robust definitions of depression. We aimed to examine regional brain atrophy in 
two large dementia focused cohorts.
METHODS: We used data from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) 
and the National Alzheimer's Co-ordinating Center (NACC), for those with data 
from at least one MRI scan. Depression ratings were available using the 
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). 
Intermittent depressive symptoms were defined as one episode above threshold (≥8 
on GDS, ≥6 on NPI depression subscale and ≥2 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
version Q depression sub-scale) and persistent as ≥2 episodes. Derived regional 
volumetric data was available from ADNI and the NACC.
RESULTS: Data was available from 698 individuals with AD in NACC and from 666 
individuals in ADNI. We found no evidence of between group differences in 
regional brain volume at baseline, or of differential atrophy in NACC. In ADNI 
we found evidence of increased brain atrophy in several frontal brain areas.
LIMITATIONS: Because this study was limited to those with MRI data, the numbers 
in some analyses were low. MRI parcellation differed between studies making 
direct comparison difficult. For some individuals only the NPI was used to rate 
depression.
CONCLUSIONS: We have found mixed evidence of increased regional atrophy in 
depression in AD, mainly in frontal brain regions. We found no evidence to 
support a vascular basis for depression in AD.

BACKGROUND: Although the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes score 
(CDR-SB) is a widely accepted and commonly used global scale, validated clinical 
endpoints of cognitive changes are unavailable in the predementia stages of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a new clinical assessment with reliability and 
sensitivity is needed in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) population.
METHODS: Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1/GO data, 
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were calculated to quantify the sensitivity of a 
measure for detecting disease progression and hypothetical treatment effects. 
All possible combinations of selected sensitive measures were assessed for 
developing composite scores. The analyses were performed in the MCI population 
and subpopulations enriched by apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4), hippocampal volume, 
and cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid.
RESULTS: The best composite score was "Word Recall + Delayed Word Recall + 
Orientation + CDR-SB + FAQ", more sensitive than 13-item Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale or CDR-SB.
CONCLUSION: The proposed composite score derived from the existing clinical 
endpoints demonstrated higher sensitivity in the MCI population and is easy to 
implement and standardize across studies.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are often present in individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. NPS are 
associated with structural and functional changes in the brain such as atrophy, 
regional hypometabolism, and hypoperfusion, considered proxies of 
neurodegeneration. Our objective was to evaluate the association between NPS and 
regional cerebral tau burden, a more direct representation of neurodegeneration, 
in cognitively normal (CN), MCI, and AD dementia individuals.
METHODS: Cross-sectional NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI) in 410 CN, 199 MCI, and 61 AD dementia participants who underwent 
flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography as part of the AD Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). Total NPI score and two factors of NPS (affective and 
hyperactive) were used in analyses. Linear regression models with backward 
elimination were employed with NPI as dependent variable and regional tau or 
tau-amyloid interaction as predictor of interest. Covariates included education, 
age, sex, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Total Learning, and Trail Making 
Test B.
RESULTS: There were significant associations (p < 0.05) between the NPI 
variables (total score, Affective factor) and entorhinal and precuneus tau 
across all participants. These associations were also significant for the 
tau-amyloid interaction. These effects were significant in cognitively 
symptomatic participants (MCI and AD dementia), but not in CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased tau burden in the entorhinal and precuneus cortices was 
modestly associated with greater NPS in MCI and AD dementia. Further evaluation 
of NPS and their effect on early-stage AD could aid in finding new interventions 
and slowing disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Primary outcome measure in the clinical trials of disease modifying 
therapy (DMT) drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has often been evaluated by 
Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDRSB). However, CDR testing requires 
specialized training and 30-50 minutes to complete, not being suitable for daily 
clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: Herein, we proposed a machine-learning method to estimate CDRSB 
changes using simpler cognitive/functional batteries (Mini-Mental State 
Examination [MMSE] and Functional Activities Questionnaire [FAQ]), to replace 
CDR testing.
METHODS: Baseline data from 944 ADNI and 171 J-ADNI amyloid-positive 
participants were used to build machine-learning models predicting annualized 
CDRSB changes between visits, based on MMSE and FAQ scores. Prediction 
performance was evaluated with mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 comparing 
predicted to actual rmDeltaCDRSB/rmDeltayear. We further assessed whether 
decline in cognitive function surpassing particular thresholds could be 
identified using the predicted rmDeltaCDRSB/rmDeltayear.
RESULTS: The models achieved the minimum required prediction errors (MAE < 1.0) 
and satisfactory prediction accuracy (R2>0.5) for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) patients for changes in CDRSB over periods of 18 months or longer. 
Predictions of annualized CDRSB progression>0.5, >1.0, or >1.5 demonstrated a 
consistent performance (i.e., Matthews correlation coefficient>0.5). These 
results were largely replicated in the J-ADNI case predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method effectively predicted MCI patient deterioration in the 
CDRSB based solely on MMSE and FAQ scores. It may aid routine practice for 
disease-modifying therapy drug efficacy evaluation, without necessitating CDR 
testing at every visit.

PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been proposed as a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the mechanisms underlying the putative 
association are poorly understood. We investigated elderly individuals with a 
remote history of TBI, aiming to understand how this may have influenced 
amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and clinical expression along the AD continuum.
METHODS: Total of 241 individual datasets including amyloid beta (Aβ) positron 
emission tomography ([18F]-AV45), structural MRI, and neuropsychological 
measures, were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 
The data were stratified into groups with (TBI +) or without (TBI -) history of 
head injury, and by clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, into subgroups with 
normal cognition (CDR = 0) and those with symptomatic cognitive decline 
(CDR ≥ 0.5). We contrasted the TBI + and TBI - subgroups with respect to the 
onset age and extent of cognitive decline, cortical thickness changes, and Aβ 
standard uptake value (SUVr).
RESULTS: Compared to the TBI -/CDR ≥ 0.5 subgroup, the TBI + /CDR ≥ 0.5 subgroup 
showed a 3-4 year earlier age of cognitive impairment onset (ACIO, p = 0.005). 
Among those participants on the AD continuum (Aβ + , as defined by a cortical 
SUVr ≥ 1.23), irrespective of current CDR, a TBI + history was associated with 
greater Aβ deposition and more pronounced cortical thinning. When matched for 
severity of cognitive status, the TBI + /CDR ≥ 0.5 group showed greater Aβ 
burden, but earlier ACIO as compared to the TBI -/CDR ≥ 0.5, suggesting a more 
indolent clinical AD progression in those with TBI history.
CONCLUSION: Remote TBI history may alter the AD onset trajectory, with 
approximately 4 years earlier ACIO, greater amyloid deposition, and cortical 
thinning.

BACKGROUND: Identifying biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progression may enable patient enrichment and improve clinical trial designs. 
Epigenome-wide association studies have revealed correlations between DNA 
methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and AD pathology and 
diagnosis. Here, we report relationships between peripheral blood DNA 
methylation profiles measured using Infinium® MethylationEPIC BeadChip and AD 
progression in participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) cohort.
RESULTS: The rate of cognitive decline from initial DNA sampling visit to 
subsequent visits was estimated by the slopes of the modified Preclinical 
Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (mPACC; mPACCdigit and mPACCtrailsB) and Clinical 
Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) plots using robust linear regression 
in cognitively normal (CN) participants and patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), respectively. In addition, diagnosis conversion status was 
assessed using a dichotomized endpoint. Two CpG sites were significantly 
associated with the slope of mPACC in CN participants (P < 5.79 × 10-8 
[Bonferroni correction threshold]); cg00386386 was associated with the slope of 
mPACCdigit, and cg09422696 annotated to RP11-661A12.5 was associated with the 
slope of CDR-SB. No significant CpG sites associated with diagnosis conversion 
status were identified. Genes involved in cognition and learning were enriched. 
A total of 19, 13, and 5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated 
with the slopes of mPACCtrailsB, mPACCdigit, and CDR-SB, respectively, were 
identified by both comb-p and DMRcate algorithms; these included DMRs annotated 
to HOXA4. Furthermore, 5 and 19 DMRs were associated with conversion status in 
CN and MCI participants, respectively. The most significant DMR was annotated to 
the AD-associated gene PM20D1 (chr1: 205,818,956 to 205,820,014 [13 probes], 
Sidak-corrected P = 7.74 × 10-24), which was associated with both the slope of 
CDR-SB and the MCI conversion status.
CONCLUSION: Candidate CpG sites and regions in peripheral blood were identified 
as associated with the rate of cognitive decline in participants in the ADNI 
cohort. While we did not identify a single CpG site with sufficient clinical 
utility to be used by itself due to the observed effect size, a biosignature 
composed of DNA methylation changes may have utility as a prognostic biomarker 
for AD progression.

Subclinical depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the brain mechanisms underlying this relationship 
are still unclear. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the brain 
substrates of subclinical depressive symptoms in cognitively unimpaired older 
adults using complementary multimodal neuroimaging data. We included cognitively 
unimpaired older adults from the baseline data of the primary cohort Age-Well 
(n = 135), and from the replication cohort ADNI (n = 252). In both cohorts, 
subclinical depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item version of the 
Geriatric Depression Scale; based on this scale, participants were classified as 
having depressive symptoms (>0) or not (0). Voxel-wise between-group comparisons 
were performed to highlight differences in gray matter volume, glucose 
metabolism and amyloid deposition; as well as white matter integrity (only 
available in Age-Well). Age-Well participants with subclinical depressive 
symptoms had lower gray matter volume in the hippocampus and lower white matter 
integrity in the fornix and the posterior parts of the cingulum and corpus 
callosum, compared to participants without symptoms. Hippocampal atrophy was 
recovered in ADNI, where participants with subclinical depressive symptoms also 
showed glucose hypometabolism in the hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus/posterior 
cingulate cortex, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and 
temporoparietal cortex. Subclinical depressive symptoms were not associated with 
brain amyloid deposition in either cohort. Subclinical depressive symptoms in 
ageing are linked with neurodegeneration biomarkers in the frontolimbic network 
including brain areas particularly sensitive to AD. The relationship between 
depressive symptoms and AD may be partly underpinned by neurodegeneration in 
common brain regions.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, 
longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, 
and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The initial study, ADNI-1, enrolled 400 subjects with early mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 with early AD, and 200 cognitively normal 
elderly controls. ADNI-1 was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 
2009 and by a competitive renewal, ADNI-2, which enrolled an additional 550 
participants and will run until 2015. This article reviews all papers published 
since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results to the end of 
2013. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the 
development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates 
of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI 
patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are largely consistent with disease 
trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimer's Dis 
2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, 
whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but 
exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) 
the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, 
the best classifiers select and combine optimum features from multiple 
modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, amyloid PET, CSF 
biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of blood biomarkers for AD 
as potentially noninvasive and low-cost alternatives to CSF biomarkers for AD 
diagnosis and the assessment of α-syn as an additional biomarker; (5) the 
development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 
42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD 
pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects and are leading 
candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (6) the 
improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects 
most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more 
sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Multimodal methods 
incorporating APOE status and longitudinal MRI proved most highly predictive of 
future decline. Refinements of clinical tests used as outcome measures such as 
clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes further reduced sample sizes; (7) the 
pioneering of genome-wide association studies that leverage quantitative imaging 
and biomarker phenotypes, including longitudinal data, to confirm recently 
identified loci, CR1, CLU, and PICALM and to identify novel AD risk loci; (8) 
worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Japan, 
Australia, Argentina, Taiwan, China, Korea, Europe, and Italy; (9) understanding 
the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of 
ADNI biomarker and clinical data to stimulate research that will resolve 
controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby 
advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (10) the 
establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data 
without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world.

Due to the clinical continuum of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accuracy of early 
diagnostic remains unsatisfactory and warrants further research. The objectives 
of this study were: (1) to develop an effective hierarchical multi-class 
framework for clinical populations, namely, normal cognition (NC), early mild 
cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD, and 
(2) to explore the geometric properties of cognition-related anatomical 
structures in the cerebral cortex. A total of 1,670 participants were enrolled 
in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, comprising 
985 participants (314 NC, 208 EMCI, 258 LMCI, and 205 AD) in the model 
development set and 685 participants (417 NC, 110 EMCI, 83 LMCI, and 75 AD) 
after 2017 in the temporal validation set. Four cortical geometric properties 
for 148 anatomical structures were extracted, namely, cortical thickness (CTh), 
fractal dimension (FD), gyrification index (GI), and sulcus depth (SD). By 
integrating these imaging features with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
scores at four-time points after the initial visit, we identified an optimal 
subset of 40 imaging features using the temporally constrained group sparse 
learning method. The combination of selected imaging features and clinical 
variables improved the multi-class performance using the AdaBoost algorithm, 
with overall accuracy rates of 0.877 in the temporal validation set. Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR) was the primary clinical variable associated with 
AD-related populations. The most discriminative imaging features included the 
bilateral CTh of the dorsal part of the posterior cingulate gyrus, 
parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), parahippocampal part of the medial 
occipito-temporal gyrus, and angular gyrus, the GI of the left inferior segment 
of the insula circular sulcus, and the CTh and SD of the left superior temporal 
sulcus (STS). Our hierarchical multi-class framework underscores the utility of 
combining cognitive variables with imaging features and the reliability of 
surface-based morphometry, facilitating more accurate early diagnosis of AD in 
clinical practice.

The Rho GTPase activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26) gene has been reported to be 
associated with neuropsychiatric diseases and neurodegenerative diseases 
including Parkinson's disease. We examined whether the ARHGAP26 gene is 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the associations of 
154 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ARHGAP26 gene with AD and 
CVD using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. 
Fourteen SNPs were associated with AD (top SNP rs3776362 with p = 3.43 × 10-3), 
while 37 SNPs revealed associations with CVD (top SNP rs415235 with 
p = 2.06 × 10-4). Interestingly, 13 SNPs were associated with both AD and CVD. 
SNP rs3776362 was associated with CVD, Functional Activities Questionnaire 
(FAQ), and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). A replication study 
using a Caribbean Hispanics sample showed that 17 SNPs revealed associations 
with AD, and 12 SNPs were associated with CVD. The third sample using a 
family-based study design showed that 9 SNPs were associated with AD, and 3 SNPs 
were associated with CVD. SNP rs6836509 within the ARHGAP10 gene (an important 
paralogon of ARHGAP26) was associated with AD and cerebrospinal fluid total tau 
(t-tau) level in the ADNI sample. Several SNPs were functionally important using 
the RegulomeDB, while a number of SNPs were associated with significant 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) databases. In conclusion, genetic variants within ARHGAP26 were 
associated with AD and CVD. These findings add important new insights into the 
potentially shared pathogenesis of AD and CVD.

BACKGROUND: Depression is considered a psychological risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We sought to examine the differential associations of depression 
severity with cognitive decline, clinical progression to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD, and neuroimaging markers of AD in cognitively normal 
older adults.
METHODS: A total of 522 cognitively normal (CN) participants who underwent 
assessments for depression (longitudinal geriatric depression scale [GDS] ) and 
cognitive assessments were included from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of 
the rate of change in GDS with amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography 
(PET), tau-PET, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET were explored. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves of clinical progression and Aβ accumulation were plotted based 
on mean annual changes in GDS. Mediation analyses were utilized to explore the 
mediation effects of AD markers.
RESULTS: Higher rate of increase in GDS was associated with faster cognitive 
decline and higher risk of progression to MCI or AD. Moreover, the rate of 
change in GDS was significantly associated with Aβ accumulation and cerebral 
glucose metabolism. The influences of the rate of change in GDS on cognition and 
clinical progression were partially mediated by Aβ accumulation and cerebral 
glucose metabolism.
LIMITATIONS: GDS is a self-reported questionnaire and not the same as a clinical 
diagnosis of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive and clinical consequences of changes in depressive 
symptoms partly stem from Aβ accumulation and cerebral glucose metabolism, which 
increases our understanding of how depressive symptoms may increase 
vulnerability to dementia.

We tested the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) are associated with apathy in individuals 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed a cohort of 105 Caucasian individuals 
with AD (age = 79.3 ± 7.03 years; MMSE = 20.2 ± 4.4) according to the presence 
of apathy, as defined either by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Apathy 
Inventory. Polymorphisms in seventeen SNPs in COMT were examined. A replication 
cohort consisting of 176 Caucasian AD subjects in the ADNI database was also 
analyzed. None of the candidate gene SNPs were significantly associated with the 
presence of apathy in either cohort. We did not find any SNPs in COMT that were 
consistently associated with apathy in individuals with AD.

Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are becoming increasingly important for 
characterizing the longitudinal course of disease, predicting the timing of 
clinical and cognitive symptoms, and for recruitment and treatment monitoring in 
clinical trials. In this work, we develop and evaluate three methods for 
modelling the longitudinal course of amyloid accumulation in three cohorts using 
amyloid PET imaging. We then use these novel approaches to investigate factors 
that influence the timing of amyloid onset and the timing from amyloid onset to 
impairment onset in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Data were acquired from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Baltimore 
Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's 
Prevention (WRAP). Amyloid PET was used to assess global amyloid burden. Three 
methods were evaluated for modelling amyloid accumulation using 10-fold 
cross-validation and holdout validation where applicable. Estimated amyloid 
onset age was compared across all three modelling methods and cohorts. Cox 
regression and accelerated failure time models were used to investigate whether 
sex, apolipoprotein E genotype and e4 carriage were associated with amyloid 
onset age in all cohorts. Cox regression was used to investigate whether 
apolipoprotein E (e4 carriage and e3e3, e3e4, e4e4 genotypes), sex or age of 
amyloid onset were associated with the time from amyloid onset to impairment 
onset (global clinical dementia rating ≥1) in a subset of 595 ADNI participants 
that were not impaired before amyloid onset. Model prediction and estimated 
amyloid onset age were similar across all three amyloid modelling methods. Sex 
and apolipoprotein E e4 carriage were not associated with PET-measured amyloid 
accumulation rates. Apolipoprotein E genotype and e4 carriage, but not sex, were 
associated with amyloid onset age such that e4 carriers became amyloid positive 
at an earlier age compared to non-carriers, and greater e4 dosage was associated 
with an earlier amyloid onset age. In the ADNI, e4 carriage, being female and a 
later amyloid onset age were all associated with a shorter time from amyloid 
onset to impairment onset. The risk of impairment onset due to age of amyloid 
onset was non-linear and accelerated for amyloid onset age >65. These findings 
demonstrate the feasibility of modelling longitudinal amyloid accumulation to 
enable individualized estimates of amyloid onset age from amyloid PET imaging. 
These estimates provide a more direct way to investigate the role of amyloid and 
other factors that influence the timing of clinical impairment in Alzheimer's 
disease.

In recent years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis using neuroimaging and deep 
learning has drawn great research attention. However, due to the scarcity of 
training neuroimaging data, many deep learning models have suffered from severe 
overfitting. In this study, we propose an ensemble learning framework that 
combines deep learning and machine learning. The deep learning model was based 
on a 3D-ResNet to exploit 3D structural features of neuroimaging data. 
Meanwhile, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning was applied on a 
voxel-wise basis to draw the most significant voxel groups out of the image. The 
3D-ResNet and XGBoost predictions were combined with patient demographics and 
cognitive test scores (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR)) to give a final diagnosis prediction. Our proposed method 
was trained and validated on brain MRI brain images of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. During the training phase, multiple data 
augmentation methods were employed to tackle overfitting. Our test set contained 
only baseline scans, i.e., the first visit scans since we aimed to investigate 
the ability of our approach in detecting AD during the first visit of AD 
patients. Our 5-fold cross-validation implementation achieved an average AUC of 
100% during training and 96% during testing. Using the same computer, our method 
was much faster in scoring a prediction, approximately 10 min, than feature 
extraction-based machine learning methods, which often take many hours to score 
a prediction. To make the prediction explainable, we visualized the brain MRI 
image regions that primarily affected the 3D-ResNet model's prediction via 
heatmap. Lastly, we observed that proper generation of test sets was critical to 
avoiding the data leakage issue and ensuring the validity of results.

BACKGROUND: A key issue to Alzheimer's disease clinical trial failures is poor 
participant selection. Participants have heterogeneous cognitive trajectories 
and many do not decline during trials, which reduces a study's power to detect 
treatment effects. Trials need enrichment strategies to enroll individuals who 
are more likely to decline.
OBJECTIVES: To develop machine learning models to predict cognitive trajectories 
in participants with early Alzheimer's disease and presymptomatic individuals 
over 24 and 48 months respectively.
DESIGN: Prognostic machine learning models were trained from a combination of 
demographics, cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data.
SETTING: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), Open Access Series of Imaging 
Studies (OASIS-3), PharmaCog, and a Phase 3 clinical trial in early Alzheimer's 
disease were used for this study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2098 participants who had demographics, cognitive 
tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data, as well as follow-up visits for 
24-48 months were included.
MEASUREMENTS: Baseline magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, 
demographics, and APOE genotype were used to separate decliners, defined as 
individuals whose CDR-Sum of Boxes scores increased during a predefined time 
window, from stable individuals. A prognostic model to predict decline at 24 
months in early Alzheimer's disease was trained on 1151 individuals who had 
baseline diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia from 
ADNI and NACC. This model was validated on 115 individuals from a placebo arm of 
a Phase 3 clinical trial and 76 individuals from the PharmaCog dataset. A second 
prognostic model to predict decline at 48 months in presymptomatic populations 
was trained on 628 individuals from ADNI and NACC who were cognitively 
unimpaired at baseline. This model was validated on 128 individuals from 
OASIS-3.
RESULTS: The models achieved up to 79% area under the curve (cross-validated and 
out-of-sample). Power analyses showed that using prognostic models to recruit 
enriched cohorts of predicted decliners can reduce clinical trial sample sizes 
by as much as 51% while maintaining the same detection power.
CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic tools for predicting cognitive decline and enriching 
clinical trials with participants at the highest risk of decline can improve 
trial quality, derisk endpoint failures, and accelerate therapeutic development 
in Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies demonstrated a significant protective effect of 
elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTREM2 levels on brain structure and 
cognitive decline. Nonetheless, the role of sTREM2 in the depression progression 
remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between CSF 
sTREM2 levels and longitudinal trajectories of depression.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Study 
were used. CSF sTREM2 levels and depression were measured using an ELISA-based 
assay and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), respectively. Linear 
mixed-effect models were employed to assess the relationships between CSF sTREM2 
levels and GDS scores.
RESULTS: A total of 1,017 participants were enrolled at baseline, with a mean 
follow-up time of 4.65 years. Baseline CSF sTREM2 levels were negatively 
correlated with GDS scores (β=-0.21, P=0.022) after adjustment for age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, education, APOE ε4 carrier status, TREM2 rare variant carrier 
status, marital status, smoking, and clinical cognitive status.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that a higher level of CSF sTREM2 was 
associated with a lower risk of depression.

Longitudinal MRI studies are of increasing importance to document the time 
course of neurodegenerative diseases as well as neuroprotective effects of a 
drug candidate in clinical trials. However, manual longitudinal image 
assessments are time consuming and conventional assessment routines often 
deliver unsatisfying study outcomes. Here, we propose a profound analysis 
pipeline that consists of the following coordinated steps: (1) an automated and 
highly precise image processing stream including voxel and surface based 
morphometry using latest highly detailed brain atlases such as the HCP MMP 1.0 
atlas with 360 cortical ROIs; (2) a profound statistical assessment using a 
multiplicative model of annual percent change (APC); and (3) a multiple testing 
correction adopted from genome-wide association studies that is optimally suited 
for longitudinal neuroimaging studies. We tested this analysis pipeline with 25 
Alzheimer's disease patients against 25 age-matched cognitively normal subjects 
with a baseline and a 1-year follow-up conventional MRI scan from the ADNI-3 
study. Even in this small cohort, we were able to report 22 significant 
measurements after multiple testing correction from SBM (including cortical 
volume, area and thickness) complementing only three statistically significant 
volume changes (left/right hippocampus and left amygdala) found by VBM. A 1-year 
decrease in brain morphometry coincided with an increasing clinical disability 
and cognitive decline in patients measured by MMSE, CDR GLOBAL, FAQ TOTAL and 
NPI TOTAL scores. This work shows that highly precise image assessments, APC 
computation and an adequate multiple testing correction can produce a 
significant study outcome even for small study sizes. With this, automated MRI 
processing is now available and reliable for routine use and clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: To examine trajectories of depression and apathy over a 5-year 
follow-up period in (prodromal) Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to relate these 
trajectories to AD biomarkers.
METHODS: The trajectories of depression and apathy (measured with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory or its questionnaire) were separately modeled using 
growth mixture models for two cohorts (National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, 
NACC, n = 22 760 and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI, n = 1 
733). The trajectories in ADNI were associated with baseline CSF AD biomarkers 
(Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau) using bias-corrected multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Multiple classes were identified, with the largest classes having no 
symptoms over time. Lower Aβ42 and higher tau (ie, more AD pathology) was 
associated with increased probability of depression and apathy over time, 
compared to classes without symptoms. Lower Aβ42 (but not tau) was associated 
with a steep increase of apathy, whereas higher tau (but not Aβ42 ) was 
associated with a steep decrease of apathy.
DISCUSSION: The trajectories of depression and apathy in individuals on the AD 
spectrum are associated with AD biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are associated with faster decline 
in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to investigate the 
association between NPS severity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, i.e., 
amyloid-β (Aβ), phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) and hippocampal volume ratio 
(HR), to characterise in more detail MCI patients with a poor prognosis.
METHODS: A total of 506 individuals with MCI and 99 cognitively unimpaired older 
adults were selected from the ADNI dataset. The patients were divided into three 
different groups based on their NPI-Q total scores: no NPS (n = 198), mild NPS 
(n = 160) and severe NPS (n = 148). Regression models were used to assess the 
association between the severity of NPS and each biomarker level and positivity 
status.
RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ levels were positively associated with older age 
and lower MMSE scores, while higher p-tau levels were associated with female sex 
and lower MMSE scores. Only patients with severe NPS had a lower HR (β = -0.18, 
p = 0.050), i.e., more pronounced medio-temporal atrophy, than those without 
NPS.
DISCUSSION: Only HR was associated with the presence of NPS, partially in line 
with previous evidence showing that severe NPS may be explained primarily by 
greater grey matter loss. Future longitudinal studies will be needed to 
ascertain the relevance of this finding.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are 
frequent and troublesome for patients and caregivers. Considering possible 
preventive approaches, a better understanding of underlying neural correlates of 
BPSD is crucial.
OBJECTIVE: The aim is to assess whether brain regional volume predicts 
behavioral changes in mild AD.
METHODS: This work took part from the PACO study, a multicenter and prospective 
study that included 252 patients with mild AD from 2009 to 2014. Fifty-three 
patients were retained. Forty healthy matched control subjects from the ADNI 
cohort were included as controls. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted 
to assess regional brain volume using baseline MRI scans as a predictor of 
future behavioral changes over a period of 18 months. Behavior was assessed at 
baseline and longitudinally at 6-month intervals using the shortened form of the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).
RESULTS: The volume of 23 brain structures in frontal, temporal, parietal, 
occipital, subcortical regions and cerebellum predicted the evolution of NPI 
scores. Frontal volume was the most powerful predictor with frontal gyri, 
anterior cingulate cortex, and orbital gyri being particularly involved.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing regional brain 
volumes as predictors of behavioral changes considered at earlier stages of AD. 
Up to 23 brain structures were associated with an increased risk of developing 
BPSD. Frontal lobe volume was the strongest predictor of future evolution of 
NPI. The involvement of multiple structures in the prediction of behavior 
suggests a role of the main large-scale networks involved in cognition.

BACKGROUND: An integrative model of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the risk factors, anatomy, biology, 
and outcomes of NPS in AD.
METHODS: 181 subjects were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Study (ADNI). NPS were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire at baseline and 6 months. NPI >3 was used as a threshold for NPS 
positivity. Three NPS courses were characterized: 1) minimal/absent (negative at 
0 and 6 months, n = 77); 2) fluctuating (positive only at one time point, 
n = 53); 3) persistent (positive at both time points, n = 51). We examined the 
association between NPS course and family history of dementia, personal history 
of psychiatric disorders, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, atrophy patterns, as 
well as longitudinal cognitive and functional measures at 12 and 24 months 
(MMSE, CDR-SOB, FAQ).
RESULTS: AD subjects with absent, fluctuating, or persistent NPS had similar CSF 
amyloid-β and tau levels. AD subjects with minimal/absent NPS had less personal 
history of psychiatric disorders (35%) than those with fluctuating (57%; 
p = 0.015) or persistent NPS (47%, not significant). At 24 months, AD subjects 
with persistent NPS had worse cognitive (MMSE; p = 0.05) and functional 
(CDR-SOB; p = 0.016) outcomes. Dorsolateral prefrontal atrophy was seen in 
persistent NPS, but not in fluctuating NPS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that individuals with personal history of 
psychiatric disorders might be more vulnerable to develop NPS throughout the 
course of AD. The worst cognitive and functional outcomes associated with NPS in 
AD underscores the importance of monitoring NPS early in the disease course.

BACKGROUND: The Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-39) scores are associated with 
future cognitive decline. We investigated whether the 12-item ECog (ECog-12), 
which is being collected in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)4, 
can predict progression.
METHODS: Baseline self (PT)- and study partner (SP)-ECog-12 data were extracted 
from the 39-item version collected in the ADNI. Weibull analysis examined the 
relationship between baseline ECog-12 and future clinical progression (change in 
Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB] scores and diagnostic 
conversion).
RESULTS: Higher PT- and SP-ECog-12 scores were associated with faster CDR-SB 
worsening, with hazard ratios in cognitively unimpaired (CU) 3.34 and 9.61, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) 1.44 and 2.82, and dementia 0.93 and 1.82. They were 
associated with conversion from CU to MCI 3.01 and 6.24 and MCI to dementia 1.61 
and 3.07.
DISCUSSION: SP-ECog-12 provided a higher prognostic value for predicting 
clinical progression, so this can help identify and monitor patients at risk in 
research and health-care settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: The 12-item Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-12) data obtained from 
both raters increased diagnostic conversion risk from cognitively unimpaired to 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. ECog-12, rated by 
study partners, was associated with an increased risk of Clinical Dementia 
Rating Sum of Boxes worsening in all diagnostic groups. Our results provide 
novel information about the specific scoring outputs and rater types 
(participant vs. study partner) of ECog-12 that can facilitate screening, 
prioritization, and longitudinal monitoring of the clinical progression of 
participants in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 4 and other 
Alzheimer's disease clinical studies, clinical trials, and in health-care 
settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequently observed, irreversible brain function 
disorder among elderly individuals. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (rs-fMRI) has been introduced as an alternative approach to assessing 
brain functional abnormalities in AD patients. However, alterations in the brain 
rs-fMRI signal complexities in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients 
remain unclear. Here, we described the novel application of permutation entropy 
(PE) to investigate the abnormal complexity of rs-fMRI signals in MCI and AD 
patients. The rs-fMRI signals of 30 normal controls (NCs), 33 early MCI (EMCI), 
32 late MCI (LMCI), and 29 AD patients were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. After preprocessing, 
whole-brain entropy maps of the four groups were extracted and subjected to 
Gaussian smoothing. We performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the 
brain entropy maps of the four groups. The results after adjusting for age and 
sex differences together revealed that the patients with AD exhibited lower 
complexity than did the MCI and NC controls. We found five clusters that 
exhibited significant differences and were distributed primarily in the 
occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes. The average PE of the five clusters 
exhibited a decreasing trend from MCI to AD. The AD group exhibited the least 
complexity. Additionally, the average PE of the five clusters was significantly 
positively correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and 
significantly negatively correlated with Functional Assessment Questionnaire 
(FAQ) scores and global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores in the patient 
groups. Significant correlations were also found between the PE and regional 
homogeneity (ReHo) in the patient groups. These results indicated that declines 
in PE might be related to changes in regional functional homogeneity in AD. 
These findings suggested that complexity analyses using PE in rs-fMRI signals 
can provide important information about the fMRI characteristics of cognitive 
impairments in MCI and AD.

BACKGROUND: Lipidomics may provide insight into biochemical processes driving 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and ensuing clinical trajectories.
OBJECTIVE: To identify a peripheral lipidomics signature associated with AD 
pathology and investigate its potential to predict clinical progression.
METHODS: We used Bayesian elastic net regression to select plasma lipid classes 
associated with the CSF pTau/Aβ42 ratio as a biomarker of AD pathology in 
preclinical and prodromal AD cases from the ADNI cohort. Consensus clustering of 
the selected lipid classes was used to identify lipidomic endophenotypes and 
study their association with clinical progression.
RESULTS: In the APOE4-adjusted model, ether-glycerophospholipids, 
lyso-glycerophospholipids, free-fatty acids, cholesterol esters, and complex 
sphingolipids were found to be associated with the CSF pTau/Aβ42 ratio. We found 
an optimal number of five lipidomic endophenotypes in the prodromal and 
preclinical cases, respectively. In the prodromal cases, these clusters differed 
with respect to the risk of clinical progression as measured by clinical 
dementia rating score conversion.
CONCLUSION: Lipid alterations can be captured at the earliest phases of AD. A 
lipidomic signature in blood may provide a dynamic overview of an individual's 
metabolic status and may support identifying different risks of clinical 
progression.

INTRODUCTION: The impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on cognitive decline 
differs by sex. Composite scores are useful as singular outcomes in clinical 
trials, yet to date these have not been developed to measure sex-specific 
change.
METHOD: We derived optimal composites from component scales available in the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database among cognitively normal and mild 
cognitively impaired subjects who are cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β positive for 
early AD. Maximally sensitive composites were constructed separately for men and 
women using standard formulas. We compared the statistical power of the 
composites with the ADNI Prodromal Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite.
RESULTS: Among 9 cognitive measures and clinical dementia rating sum of boxes, 
the optimal sex-specific composites included 5 measures, including the clinical 
dementia rating and 4 distinct cognitive measures. The sex-specific composites 
consistently outperformed sex-agnostic composites and the ADNI Prodromal 
Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite.
DISCUSSION: Sex-specific composite scales may improve the power of longitudinal 
studies of early AD and clinical trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis often requires invasive examinations (e.g., 
liquor analyses), expensive tools (e.g., brain imaging) and highly specialized 
personnel. The diagnosis commonly is established when the disorder has already 
caused severe brain damage, and the clinical signs begin to be apparent. 
Instead, accessible and low-cost approaches for early identification of subjects 
at high risk for developing AD years before they show overt symptoms are 
fundamental to provide a critical time window for more effective clinical 
management, treatment, and care planning. This article proposes an 
ensemble-based machine learning algorithm for predicting AD development within 9 
years from first overt signs and using just five clinical features that are 
easily detectable with neuropsychological tests. The validation of the system 
involved both healthy individuals and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients 
drawn from the ADNI open dataset, at variance with previous studies that 
considered only MCI. The system shows higher levels of balanced accuracy, 
negative predictive value, and specificity than other similar solutions. These 
results represent a further important step to build a preventive fast-screening 
machine-learning-based tool to be used as a part of routine healthcare 
screenings.

Based on a set of subjects and a collection of attributes obtained from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we used redescription 
mining to find interpretable rules revealing associations between those 
determinants that provide insights about the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
extended the CLUS-RM redescription mining algorithm to a constraint-based 
redescription mining (CBRM) setting, which enables several modes of targeted 
exploration of specific, user-constrained associations. Redescription mining 
enabled finding specific constructs of clinical and biological attributes that 
describe many groups of subjects of different size, homogeneity and levels of 
cognitive impairment. We confirmed some previously known findings. However, in 
some instances, as with the attributes: testosterone, ciliary neurotrophic 
factor, brain natriuretic peptide, Fas ligand, the imaging attribute Spatial 
Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD, as well as the levels of 
leptin and angiopoietin-2 in plasma, we corroborated previously debatable 
findings or provided additional information about these variables and their 
association with AD pathogenesis. Moreover, applying redescription mining on 
ADNI data resulted with the discovery of one largely unknown attribute: the 
Pregnancy-Associated Protein-A (PAPP-A), which we found highly associated with 
cognitive impairment in AD. Statistically significant correlations (p ≤ 0.01) 
were found between PAPP-A and clinical tests: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, Mini Mental State Examination, 
etc. The high importance of this finding lies in the fact that PAPP-A is a 
metalloproteinase, known to cleave insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. 
Since it also shares similar substrates with A Disintegrin and the 
Metalloproteinase family of enzymes that act as α-secretase to physiologically 
cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, it 
could be directly involved in the metabolism of APP very early during the 
disease course. Therefore, further studies should investigate the role of PAPP-A 
in the development of AD more thoroughly.

IMPORTANCE: Undetected biological heterogeneity adversely impacts trials in 
Alzheimer's disease because rate of cognitive decline - and perhaps response to 
treatment - differs in subgroups. Recent results show that data-driven 
approaches can unravel the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease progression. The 
resulting stratification is yet to be leveraged in clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether image-based data-driven disease progression 
modelling could identify baseline biological heterogeneity in a clinical trial, 
and whether these subgroups have prognostic or predictive value.
DESIGN: Screening data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer 
Disease (A4) Study collected between April 2014 and December 2017, and 
longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
observational study downloaded in February 2022 were used.
SETTING: The A4 Study is an interventional trial involving 67 sites in the US, 
Canada, Australia, and Japan. ADNI is a multi-center observational study in 
North America.
PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively unimpaired amyloid-positive participants with a 
3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scan. Amyloid positivity was determined using 
florbetapir PET imaging (in A4) and CSF Aβ(1-42) (in ADNI).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regional volumes estimated from MRI scans were used 
as input to the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm. Outcomes 
included cognitive test scores and SUVr values from florbetapir and flortaucipir 
PET.
RESULTS: We included 1,240 Aβ+ participants (and 407 Aβ- controls) from the A4 
Study, and 731 A4-eligible ADNI participants. SuStaIn identified three 
neurodegeneration subtypes - Typical, Cortical, Subcortical - comprising 523 
(42%) individuals. The remainder are designated subtype zero (insufficient 
atrophy). Baseline PACC scores (A4 primary outcome) were significantly worse in 
the Cortical subtype (median = -1.27, IQR=[-3.34,0.83]) relative to both subtype 
zero (median=-0.013, IQR=[-1.85,1.67], P<.0001) and the Subcortical subtype 
(median=0.03, IQR=[-1.78,1.61], P=.0006). In ADNI, over a four-year period 
(comparable to A4), greater cognitive decline in the mPACC was observed in both 
the Typical (-0.23/yr; 95% CI, [-0.41,-0.05]; P=.01) and Cortical (-0.24/yr; 
[-0.42,-0.06]; P=.009) subtypes, as well as the CDR-SB (Typical: +0.09/yr, 
[0.06,0.12], P<.0001; and Cortical: +0.07/yr, [0.04,0.10], P<.0001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a large secondary prevention trial, our 
image-based model detected neurodegenerative heterogeneity predictive of 
cognitive heterogeneity. We argue that such a model is a valuable tool to be 
considered in future trial design to control for previously undetected variance.

Understanding the psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer s disease (AD) is crucial 
for advancing precision medicine and therapeutic strategies. The relationship 
between AD behavioral symptoms and asymmetry in spatial tau PET patterns is not 
well-known. Braak tau progression implicates the temporal lobes early. However, 
the clinical and pathological implications of temporal tau laterality remain 
unexplored. This cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between 
temporal tau PET asymmetry and behavior assessed using the neuropsychiatric 
inventory and composite scores for memory, executive function, and language, 
using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. 
In the entire cohort, continuous right and left temporal tau contributions to 
behavior and cognition were evaluated, controlling for age, sex, education, and 
tau burden on the contralateral side. Additionally, a temporal tau laterality 
index was calculated to define "asymmetry-extreme" groups (individuals with 
laterality indices greater than two standard deviations from the mean). 695 
individuals (age = 73.9 ± 7.6 years, 372 (53.5 %) females) were included, 
comprising 281 (40%) cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid negative, 185 (27%) CU 
amyloid positive, and 229 (33%) impaired (CI) amyloid positive participants. In 
the full cohort analysis, right temporal tau was associated with worse behavior 
(B = 8.14, p-value = 0.007), and left temporal tau was associated with worse 
language (B = 1.4, p-value < 0.001). Categorization into asymmetry-extreme 
groups revealed 20 right- and 27 left-asymmetric participants. Within these 
extreme groups, there was additional heterogeneity along the anterior-posterior 
dimension. Asymmetrical tau burden is associated with distinct behavioral and 
cognitive profiles. Wide multi-cultural implementation of social cognition 
measures is needed to understand right-sided asymmetry in AD.

with worse language (B(SE)=1.4(0.2), p-value<0.0001). Categorization into 
asymmetry-extreme groups revealed 20 right- and 27 left-asymmetric participants. 
Within these extreme groups, four patterns of tau PET uptake were observed: 
anterior temporal, typical AD, typical AD with frontal involvement, and 
posterior. Asymmetrical tau burden is associated with distinct behavioral and 
cognitive profiles. Behavioral and socioemotional measures are needed to 
understand right-sided asymmetry in AD.

Disease Progression.

BACKGROUND: Progression in Alzheimer's disease manifests as changes in multiple 
biomarker, cognitive, and functional endpoints. Disease progression modeling can 
be used to integrate these multiple measures into a synthesized metric of where 
a patient lies within the disease spectrum, allowing for a more dynamic measure 
over the range of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to combine modeling techniques from psychometric 
research (e.g., item response theory) and pharmacometrics (e.g., hierarchical 
models) to describe the multivariate longitudinal disease progression for 
patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we aimed to 
extend the subsequent model to make it suitable for clinical trial simulation, 
with the inclusion of covariates, to explain variability in latent progression 
(i.e., disease progression) and to aid in the assessment of enrichment 
strategies.
DESIGN: Multiple longitudinal endpoints in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative database were modeled. This model was validated internally using 
visual predictive checks, and externally by comparing data from the placebo arms 
of two Phase 2 crenezumab studies, ABBY (NCT01343966) and BLAZE (NCT01397578).
SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative began in 2004: the 
initial 5-year study (ADNI-1) was extended by 2 years in 2009 by a Grand 
Opportunities grant (ADNI-GO), and in 2011 and 2016 by further competitive 
renewals of the ADNI-1 grant (ADNI-2 and ADNI-3, respectively). This work 
studies natural progression data from patients with confirmed Alzheimer's 
disease. The Phase 2 ABBY and BLAZE trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
PARTICIPANTS: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, 305 
subjects who had a baseline diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease 
were included in modeling. From the ABBY and BLAZE studies, 158 patients were 
included from the studies' placebo arms.
MEASUREMENTS: Longitudinal cognitive and functional assessments modeled included 
the Clinical Dementia Rating (both as Sum of Boxes and individual item scores), 
the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - 
Cognitive Subscale, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Also included 
were the imaging variable fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and 
the following magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics: entorhinal, fusiform, 
hippocampal, intra-cranial, mid-temporal, ventricular, and whole brain.
RESULTS: Applying item response theory approaches in this longitudinal setting 
showed clinical assessments informing a common disease scale in the following 
order (from early disease to late disease): Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 
Functional Activities Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale 12, Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum 
of Boxes, and Mini-Mental State Examination. The Clinical Dementia Rating 
communication and home-and-hobbies items were most informative at earlier 
disease stages, while memory, orientation, and personal care informed the 
disease status at later stages. A clinical trial simulation model was developed 
and accurately described within-sample longitudinal distribution of endpoints. 
Simplifying the model to use only baseline age, MMSE, and APOEε4 status as 
predictors, out-of-sample mean progression of ADAS-Cog and CDR Sum of Boxes in 
the ABBY and BLAZE placebo arms was accurately described; however, the 
variability in these endpoints was underpredicted and suggests possibility for 
further model refinement when extrapolating from the ADNI sample to trial data. 
Clinical trial simulations were performed to exemplify use of the model to 
investigate hypothetical disease modification effects on the multivariate, 
longitudinal progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive 
Subscale and the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes.
CONCLUSIONS: The latent variable structure of item response theory can be 
extended to capture a variety of scales that are common assessments and 
indicators of disease status in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. These 
models are not intended to support causal inferences, but they do successfully 
characterize the observed correlation between endpoints over time and result in 
concise numerical indices of disease status that reflect the totality of 
evidence from considering the endpoints jointly. As such, the models have 
utility for a variety of tasks in clinical trial design, including simulation of 
hypothetical drug effects, interpolation of missing data, and assessment of 
in-sample information.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a sex-specific risk scoring system, abbreviated 
as SRSS-CNMCI, for the prediction of the conversion of cognitively normal (CN) 
people into patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to provide a reliable 
tool for the prevention of MCI.
METHODS: CN at baseline participants 61-90 years of age were selected from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database with at least one 
follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify 
the major risk factors associated with the conversion from CN to MCI and to 
develop the SRSS-CNMCI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
was used to determine risk cutoff points corresponding to an optimal prediction. 
The results were externally validated, including evaluation of the 
discrimination and calibration in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) database.
RESULTS: A total of 471 participants, including 240 female (51%) and 231 male 
participants (49%) aged from 61 to 90 years, were included in the study cohort. 
The final multivariable models and the SRSS-CNMCI included age, APOE e4, mini 
mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical dementia rating (CDR). The 
C-statistics of the SRSS-CNMCI were 0.902 in the female subgroup and 0.911 in 
the male subgroup. The cutoff point of high and low risks was 33% in the female 
subgroup, indicating that more than 33% female participants were considered to 
have a high risk, and more than 9% participants were considered to have a high 
risk in the male subgroup. The SRSS-CNMCI performed well in the external cohort: 
the C-statistics were 0.950 in the female subgroup and 0.965 in the male 
subgroup.
CONCLUSION: The SRSS-CNMCI performs well in various cohorts and provides an 
accurate prediction and a generalization.

A coding missense mutation (rs3747742) in triggering receptor expressed on 
myeloid cell-like 2 (TREML2) has been recently proposed as an important 
protective factor against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the link between 
TREML2 and AD pathology remains unclear. Therefore, we explored the association 
of TREML2 rs3747742 with cognitive function, neuroimaging biomarkers and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers related to AD, including CSF total-tau 
(T-tau), phosphor-tau (P-tau), and amyloid-β (Aβ1-42). As for cognitive 
function, related cognitive scores of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDRSB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section 11 (ADAS-cog 
11), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) were extracted. We used a multiple linear regression model to examine 
the association of TREML2 rs3747742 with the baseline variables. Furthermore, we 
also calculated the change rate of above variables influenced by TREML2 
rs3747742 via applying a mixed-effects model over a 4-year follow-up. In this 
analysis, a total of 1,306 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database were included. Finally, we observed that only in AD 
patients, but not in normal controls or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
individuals, TREML2 rs3747742 exhibited a strong association with CSF total-tau 
levels at baseline (β = -22.1210, p = 0.0166) and 4-year follow-up (β = -0.3961, 
p = 0.0115). Furthermore, no associations were found with CSF Aβ1-42 levels, 
P-tau levels, neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive function neither for 
baseline variables nor for longitudinal data. Thus, this study indicated that 
TREML2 mediated the risk of AD through influencing AD-related neurodegeneration 
(abnormal T-tau levels) but not P-tau levels and Aβ pathology.

OBJECTIVE: Since apathy increases in prevalence with severity of dementia 
pathology, we sought to distinguish concomitant neurodegenerative processes from 
brain differences associated with apathy in persons with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We examined relative structural 
brain differences between case-control matched cognitively impaired patients 
with and without apathy.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study.
SETTING: Fifty-eight clinical sites in phase 2 of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
across the United States and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: The ≥ 55 years of age with MCI or AD dementia and no major 
neurological disorders aside from suspected incipient AD dementia. Participants 
with apathy (n=69) were age-, sex-, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carrier status-, 
Mini-Mental State Exam score-, and MCI or AD dementia diagnosis-matched to 
participants without apathy (n=149).
INTERVENTIONS: The 3-tesla T1-weighted MRI scan and neurocognitive assessments. 
Using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy domain scores, participants were 
dichotomized into a with-apathy group (score ≥ 1) and a without-apathy group 
(score = 0).
MEASUREMENTS: Cortical thicknesses from 24 a priori regions of interest involved 
in frontostriatal circuits and frontotemporal association areas.
RESULTS: False-discovery rate adjusted within-group comparisons between 
participants with apathy and participants without apathy showed thinner right 
medial orbitofrontal (mOFC; 
meandifference(MD)±standarderrorofMD(SE)=-0.0879±0.0257mm; 
standardizedMD(d)=-0.4456) and left rostral anterior cingulate (rACC; 
MD±SE=-0.0905±0.0325mm; d=-0.3574) cortices and thicker left middle temporal 
cortices (MTC; MD±SE=0.0688±0.0239mm; d=0.3311) in those with apathy.
CONCLUSION: Atrophy of the right mOFC and left rACC and sparing of atrophy in 
the left MTC are associated with apathy in cognitively impaired persons.

Evidence from murine models and human post-mortem studies indicates that 
monoaminergic nuclei undergo degeneration at the pre-symptomatic stage of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Analysing 129 datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and relying on the Clinical Dementia Rating as 
group-defining instrument, we hypothesised that the MRI signal of monoaminergic 
nuclei would be a statistically significant predictor of memory decline in 
participants initially recruited in ADNI as healthy adults. As opposed to a 
group of cognitively stable participants, participants developing memory decline 
had reduced signal in the ventral tegmental area at baseline, before any 
evidence of functional decline emerged. These findings indicate that 
monoaminergic degeneration predates the onset of memory decline in an AD-centred 
initiative, with a crucial involvement of very-early changes of a dopaminergic 
region. This translates into potential informative avenues for pharmacological 
treatment of pre-symptomatic AD.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, also known as behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), affect the majority of patients with 
dementia, and result in a greater cognitive and functional impairment.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between BPSD and amyloid cerebral 
deposition as measured by 18F-Florbetapir-PET quantitative uptake in elderly 
subjects with and without cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Participants with cognitive impairment [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
or Alzheimer's disease (AD)] and healthy controls (HC) from the ADNI cohort 
(Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) who underwent an 18F-florbetapir PET 
scan between May 2010 and March 2014 were included. Clinical assessments 
included the Clinical Dementia Rating, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Freesurfer software was used to extract PET 
counts based on T1-based structural ROI (frontal, cingulate, parietal, and 
temporal). Spearman's partial correlation scores between BPSD severity and 
regional amyloid uptake were calculated.
RESULTS: Data for 657 participants [age = 72.6 (7.19); MMSE = 27.4 (2.67)] were 
analyzed, including 230 HC [age = 73.1 (6.02); MMSE = 29 (1.21)], 308 MCI 
[age = 71.5 (7.44); MMSE = 28.0 (1.75)], and 119 AD subjects [age = 74.7 (8.05); 
MMSE = 23.1 (2.08)]. Considering all diagnostic groups together, positive 
significant correlations were found between anxiety and 18F-florbetapir uptake 
in the frontal (r = 0.102; p = 0.009), cingulate (r = 0.083; p = 0.034), and 
global cerebral uptake (r = 0.099; p = 0.011); between irritability and frontal 
(r = 0.089; p = 0.023), cingulate (r = 0.085; p = 0.030), parietal (r = 0.087; 
p = 0.025), and global cerebral uptake (r = 0.093; p = 0.017); in the MCI 
subgroup, between anxiety and frontal (r = 0.126; p = 0.03) and global uptake 
(r = 0.14; p = 0.013); in the AD subgroup, between irritability and parietal 
uptake (r = 0.201; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Anxiety and irritability are associated with greater amyloid 
deposition in the neurodegenerative process leading to AD.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability in performance among placebo groups in 
randomized controlled trials for mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Placebo group data were obtained from 2 National Institute on Aging 
(NIA) MCI randomized controlled trials, the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative 
Study (ADCS) MCI trial and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), which is a simulated clinical trial, in addition to industry-sponsored 
clinical trials involving rivastigmine, galantamine, rofecoxib, and donepezil. 
The data were collated for common measurement instruments. The performance of 
the placebo participants from these studies was tracked on the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and 
Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes, and for progression on these measures to 
prespecified clinical study endpoints. APOE status, where available, was also 
analyzed for its effects.
RESULTS: The progression to clinical endpoints varied a great deal among the 
trials. The expected performances were seen for the participants in the 2 NIA 
trials, ADCS and ADNI, with generally worsening of performance over time; 
however, the industry-sponsored trials largely showed stable or improved 
performance in their placebo participants. APOE4 carrier status influenced 
results in an expected fashion on the study outcomes, including rates of 
progression and cognitive subscales.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of apparently similar criteria for MCI being adopted by 
the 7 studies, the implementation of the criteria varied a great deal. Several 
explanations including instruments used to characterize participants and 
variability among study populations contributed to the findings.

Accumulating evidence suggests that α-synuclein plays a role in the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined whether 
α-synuclein level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was associated with cognitive 
functioning among older adults. We also explored whether this relationship was 
mediated by proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, along with sIL-6R and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Using a cross-sectional Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 148) sample, we examined the 
relationship between α-synuclein and participants' performance on Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive 
Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) at baseline. Mediation analyses were utilized, adjusting 
for age, education, APOEe4, and Geriatric Depression Scale scores. All 
biological markers were measured in CSF. Participants in the current sample were 
58.3% males, 41.7% females, and Caucasian (95.5%); their average education and 
age were 15.5 (standard deviation [SD] = 2.97) and 74.4 (SD = 7.51) years, 
respectively. Higher accumulation of α-synuclein was associated with poorer MMSE 
scores (β = -0.41, standard error [SE] = 1.54, p < .001). This relationship 
appeared to be mediated by VEGF (β = 0.27, SE = 2.15, p = .025) and IL-6r 
(β = 0.22, SE = 1.66, p < .026). In addition, α-synuclein was associated with 
poorer performance on the ADAS-Cog 13 (β = 0.34, p = .005) and mediated by VEGF 
(β = -0.19, SE = 4.13, p = .025) after adjusting for age, education, APOEe4, and 
depressive symptoms. α-Synuclein may serve as an additional biomarker for 
determining poor cognitive functioning. VEGF and IL-6 soluble receptors were 
significant mediators of the relationship between α-synuclein and cognitive 
functioning. If confirmed in prospective analyses, these findings can further 
inform the pathologic cascade and early diagnosis of AD.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) promotes neuronal survival downstream. 
This longitudinal study evaluated whether the TNFRSF1B gene encoding TNFR2 and 
levels of its soluble form (sTNFR2) affect Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers and 
clinical outcomes. Data analyzed included 188 patients in the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and AD dementia. Further, a replication study was performed in 48 patients with 
MCI with positive AD biomarkers who were treated at a memory clinic. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTNFR2 levels along with two related TNFRSF1B gene 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs976881 and rs1061622 were assessed. 
General linear models were used to evaluate the effect of CSF sTNFR2 levels and 
each SNP in relationship to CSF t-tau and p-tau, cognitive domains, MRI brain 
measures, and longitudinal cognitive changes after adjustments were made for 
covariates such as APOE ε4 status. In the ADNI cohort, a significant interaction 
between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF t-tau and p-tau levels; 
hippocampal and whole brain volumes; and Digit Span Forwards subtest scores. In 
the replication cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 modulates CSF p-tau. A significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 also impacts Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores over 12 months 
in the ADNI cohort. The interaction between TNFRSF1B variant rs976881 and CSF 
sTNFR2 levels was noted to modulate multiple AD-associated severity markers and 
cognitive domains. This interaction impacts resilience-related clinical outcomes 
in AD and lends support to sTNFR2 as a promising candidate for therapeutic 
targeting to improve clinical outcomes of interest.

Adults.

BACKGROUND: Affective neuropsychiatric symptoms (aNPS: depression, anxiety, 
apathy, irritability) have been linked to increased dementia risk. However, less 
is known whether this association is independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathophysiology.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of early aNPS to dementia risk in 
cognitively normal (CN) older adults and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
patients, with and without AD biomarker abnormality.
METHODS: Participants included 763 community-dwelling, stroke-free older adults 
identified as CN and 617 with MCI at baseline, drawn from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Baseline assessments included a 
neuropsychological battery, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and 
apolipoprotein E ɛ4 (ApoE4) genotyping. A participant subset completed 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker assessment. Time to progression to 
dementia was measured based on months at follow-up when an individual was 
diagnosed with dementia, over the follow-up period of 48 months.
RESULTS: Latent class analysis identified 3 subgroups of older adults in CN and 
MCI, indicated by the baseline profiles of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). 
Subgroups with higher aNPS were at increased risk of progression to dementia in 
both CN (HR = 3.65, 95% CI [1.80, 7.40]) and MCI (HR = 1.52, 95% CI [1.16, 
2.00]; HR = 1.86 [1.05, 3.30]) groups, adjusting for age, sex, global cognition, 
and ApoE4, compared with their counterparts with minimal NPS. There was no 
difference between higher aNPS and minimal NPS subgroups in their CSF AD 
biomarker profiles.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that aNPS may represent a neurobiological 
vulnerability that uniquely contribute to the dementia risk, independent of AD 
biomarker profiles.

Patterns of Glucose Metabolism in [ (18) F]FDG PET Indicate Regional Variability 
and Neurodegeneration in the Progression of Alzheimer's Dementia.

Lee JJ, Earnest T, Ha SM, Bani A, Kothapalli D, Liu P, Sotiras A.

In disorders of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
neurodegeneration is the final common pathway of disease progression. 
Modulating, reversing, or preventing disease progression is a clinical 
imperative most likely to succeed following accurate and explanatory 
understanding of neurodegeneration, requiring enhanced consistency with 
quantitative measurements and expanded interpretability of complex data. The 
on-going study of neurodegeneration has robustly demonstrated the advantages of 
accumulating large amounts of clinical data that include neuroimaging, motiving 
multi-center studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Demonstrative advantages also arise from highly multivariate analysis 
methods, and this work reports advances provided by non-negative matrix 
factorization (NMF). NMF revealed patterns of covariance for glucose metabolism, 
estimated by positron emission tomography of [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose, in 243 
healthy normal participants of ADNI. Patterns for glucose metabolism provided 
cross-sectional inferences for 860 total participants of ADNI with and without 
cerebral amyloidosis and clinical dementia ratings (CDR) ranging 0-3. Patterns 
for glucose metabolism were distinct in number and topography from patterns 
identified in previous studies of structural MRI. They were also distinct from 
well-establish topographies of resting-state neuronal networks mapped by 
functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patterns for glucose metabolism 
identified significant topographical landmarks relating age, sex, APOE ε4 
alleles, amyloidosis, CDR, and neurodegeneration. Patterns involving insular and 
orbitofrontal cortices, as well as midline regions of frontal and parietal lobes 
demonstrated the greatest neurodegeneration with progressive Alzheimer's 
dementia. A single pattern for the lateral parietal and posterior superior 
temporal cortices demonstrated preserved glucose metabolism for all diagnostic 
groups, including Alzheimer's dementia. Patterns correlated significantly with 
topical terms from the Neurosynth platform, thereby providing semantic 
representations for patterns such as attention, memory, language, fear/reward, 
movement and motor planning. In summary, NMF is a data-driven, principled, 
supervised statistical learning method that provides interpretable patterns of 
neurodegeneration. These patterns can help inform the understanding and 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: ▪ Data-driven non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) identified 24 
canonical patterns of spatial covariance of cerebral glucose metabolism. The 
training data comprised healthy older participants (CDR = 0 without amyloidosis) 
cross-sectionally drawn from ADNI. ▪ In healthy participants, mean SUVRs for 
specific patterns in precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, and subcortical areas 
including superficial white matter and striatum, demonstrated increasing glucose 
metabolism with advancing age. ▪ In asymptomatic participants with amyloidosis , 
glucose metabolism increased compared to those who were asymptomatic without 
amyloid , particularly in medial prefrontal cortex, frontoparietal cortex, 
occipital white, and posterior cerebellar regions. ▪ In symptomatic participants 
with amyloidosis , insular cortex, medial frontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex 
demonstrated the most severe losses of glucose metabolism with increasing CDR. 
Lateral parietal and posterior superior temporal cortices retained glucose 
metabolism even for CDR > 0.5. ▪ NMF models of glucose metabolism are consistent 
with models arising from principal components, or eigenbrains, while adding 
additional regional interpretability. ▪ NMF patterns correlated with regions 
catalogued in Neurosynth. Following corrections for spatial autocorrelations, 
NMF patterns revealed meta-analytic identifications of patterns with Neurosynth 
topics of fear/reward, attention, memory, language, and movement with motor 
planning. Patterns varied with degrees of cognitive impairment.

PURPOSE: Automated diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease remain a 
challenging problem that machine learning (ML) techniques have attempted to 
resolve in the last decade. This study introduces a first-of-its-kind 
color-coded visualization mechanism driven by an integrated ML model to predict 
disease trajectory in a 2-year longitudinal study. The main aim of this study is 
to help capture visually in 2D and 3D renderings the diagnosis and prognosis of 
AD, therefore augmenting our understanding of the processes of multiclass 
classification and regression analysis.
METHOD: The proposed method, Machine Learning for Visualizing AD (ML4VisAD), is 
designed to predict disease progression through a visual output. This newly 
developed model takes baseline measurements as input to generate a color-coded 
visual image that reflects disease progression at different time points. The 
architecture of the network relies on convolutional neural networks. With 1123 
subjects selected from the ADNI QT-PAD dataset, we use a 10-fold 
cross-validation process to evaluate the method. Multimodal inputs* include 
neuroimaging data (MRI, PET), neuropsychological test scores (excluding MMSE, 
CDR-SB, and ADAS to avoid bias), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers with 
measures of amyloid beta (ABETA), phosphorylated tau protein (PTAU), total tau 
protein (TAU), and risk factors that include age, gender, years of education, 
and ApoE4 gene.
FINDINGS/RESULTS: Based on subjective scores reached by three raters, the 
results showed an accuracy of 0.82 ± 0.03 for a 3-way classification and 
0.68 ± 0.05 for a 5-way classification. The visual renderings were generated in 
0.08 msec for a 23 × 23 output image and in 0.17 ms for a 45 × 45 output image. 
Through visualization, this study (1) demonstrates that the ML visual output 
augments the prospects for a more accurate diagnosis and (2) highlights why 
multiclass classification and regression analysis are incredibly challenging. An 
online survey was conducted to gauge this visualization platform's merits and 
obtain valuable feedback from users. All implementation codes are shared online 
on GitHub.
CONCLUSION: This approach makes it possible to visualize the many nuances that 
lead to a specific classification or prediction in the disease trajectory, all 
in context to multimodal measurements taken at baseline. This ML model can serve 
as a multiclass classification and prediction model while reinforcing the 
diagnosis and prognosis capabilities by including a visualization platform.

INTRODUCTION: It is important to study apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to 
better understand its underlying neurobiology and develop effective 
interventions. In the current study, we sought to examine the relationships 
between longitudinal apathy and regional tau burden in cognitively impaired 
older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database.
METHODS: Three hundred and nineteen ADNI participants with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or AD dementia underwent flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical assessment with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) annually. Longitudinal NPI Apathy (NPI-A) 
scores were examined in relation to baseline tau PET signal in three a priori 
selected regions implicated in AD and AD-related apathy (supramarginal gyrus, 
entorhinal cortex [EC] and rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC]). Secondary 
models were adjusted for global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) 
and cortical amyloid (florbetapir PET).
RESULTS: Higher baseline supramarginal gyrus and EC tau burden were each 
significantly associated with greater NPI-A over time, while rACC tau was 
associated with higher NPI-A but did not predict its trajectory over time. These 
results were retained for supramarginal and EC tau after adjusting models for 
global cognition and cortical amyloid.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that baseline in vivo tau burden in parietal 
and temporal brain regions affected in AD, and less so in a medial frontal 
region involved in motivational control, is associated with increasing apathy 
over time in older adults with MCI and AD dementia. Future work studying 
emergent apathy in relation to not only core AD pathology but also circuit level 
dysfunction may provide additional insight into the neurobiology of apathy in AD 
and opportunities for intervention.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau (Flortaucipir PET) in regions implicated in AD was associated 
with increasing apathy over timeCortical amyloid was also found to be a robust 
predictor of the trajectory of apathyEvidence of synergy between regional tau 
and amyloid in overall higher levels of apathy.

INTRODUCTION: Word-list recall tests are routinely used for cognitive 
assessment, and process scoring may improve their accuracy. We examined whether 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) derived, 
process-based digital cognitive biomarkers (DCBs) at baseline predicted Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR) longitudinally and compared them to standard metrics.
METHODS: Analyses were performed with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) data from 330 participants (mean age = 71.4 ± 7.2). We 
conducted regression analyses predicting CDR at 36 months, controlling for 
demographics and genetic risk, with ADAS-Cog traditional scores and DCBs as 
predictors.
RESULTS: The best predictor of CDR at 36 months was M, a DCB reflecting recall 
ability (area under the curve = 0.84), outperforming traditional scores. 
Diagnostic results suggest that M may be particularly useful to identify 
individuals who are unlikely to decline.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that M outperforms ADAS-Cog traditional 
metrics and supports process scoring for word-list recall tests. More research 
is needed to determine further applicability with other tests and populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Process scoring and latent modeling were more effective than 
traditional scoring. Latent recall ability (M) was the best predictor of 
Clinical Dementia Rating decline at 36 months. The top digital cognitive 
biomarker model had odds ≈ 90 times greater than the top Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale model. Particularly high negative predictive 
value supports literature on cognitive testing as a useful screen. Consideration 
of both cognitive and pathological outcomes is needed.

Our goal was to assess the enrichment utility of hippocampal volume (HV) as an 
enrichment biomarker in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) clinical 
trials, and, hence, develop an HV neuroimaging-informed clinical trial 
enrichment tool. Modeling of integrated longitudinal patient-level data came 
from open-access natural history studies in patients diagnosed with aMCI-the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1 and ADNI-2-and indicated 
that a decrease of 1 cm3 with respect to the analysis dataset median baseline 
intracranial volume-adjusted HV (ICV-HV; ~ 5 cm3 ) is associated with > 50% 
increase in disease progression rate as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating 
Scale-Sum of Boxes. Clinical trial simulations showed that the inclusion of aMCI 
subjects with baseline ICV-HV below the 84th or 50th percentile allowed an 
approximate reduction in trial size of at least 26% and 55%, respectively. This 
clinical trial enrichment tool can help design more efficient and informative 
clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the statistical power of plasma, imaging, and 
cognition biomarkers as Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trial outcome 
measures.
METHODS: Plasma neurofilament light, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and 
cognition were measured longitudinally in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) in control (amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42 negative [Aβ-] with 
Clinical Dementia Rating scale [CDR] = 0; n = 330), preclinical AD (Aβ + with 
CDR = 0; n = 218) and mild AD (Aβ + with CDR = 0.5-1; n = 697) individuals. A 
statistical power analysis was performed across biomarkers and groups based on 
longitudinal mixed effects modeling and using several different clinical trial 
designs.
RESULTS: For a 30-month trial of preclinical AD, both the temporal composite and 
hippocampal volumes were superior to plasma neurofilament light and cognition. 
For an 18-month trial of mild AD, hippocampal volume was superior to all other 
biomarkers. Plasma neurofilament light became more effective with increased 
trial duration or sampling frequency. Imaging biomarkers were characterized by 
high slope and low within-subject variability, while plasma neurofilament light 
and cognition were characterized by higher within-subject variability.
INTERPRETATION: MRI measures had properties that made them preferable to 
cognition and pNFL as outcome measures in clinical trials of early AD, 
regardless of cognitive status. However, pNfL and cognition can still be 
effective depending on inclusion criteria, sampling frequency, and response to 
therapy. Future trials will help to understand how sensitive pNfL and MRI are to 
detect downstream effects on neurodegeneration of drugs targeting amyloid and 
tau pathology in AD.

BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common and problematic symptom of several 
neurodegenerative illnesses, but its neuroanatomical bases are not understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the regions associated with apathy in subjects with mild 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a method that accounts for the significant 
co-linearity of regional atrophy and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
METHODS: We identified 57 subjects with mild AD (CDR = 1) and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We 
performed a multivariate multiple regression with LASSO regularization on all 
symptom subscales of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the whole-brain ROI 
volumes calculated from their baseline MRIs with FreeSurfer. We compared our 
results to those from a previous study using the same method in patients with 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS).
RESULTS: Of neuropsychiatric symptoms, apathy showed the most robust 
neuroanatomical associations in the AD subjects. Atrophy of the following 
regions were independently associated with apathy: the ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; posterior cingulate cortex and adjacent 
lateral cortex; and the bank of the superior temporal sulcus. These results 
replicate previous studies using FTD and CBS patients, mostly agree with the 
previous literature on apathy in AD, and correspond to the Medial and Orbital 
Prefrontal Cortex networks identified in non-human primates.
CONCLUSION: The current study, previous studies from our laboratory, and the 
previous literature suggest that impairment of the same brain networks involved 
in arousal, threat response, and reward processing are associated with apathy in 
AD and FTD.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has come to be recognized as a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with poorly understood underlying mechanisms. We 
hypothesized that a history of TBI would be associated with greater tau 
deposition in elders with high-risk for dementia. A Groups of 20 participants 
with self-reported history of TBI and 100 without any such history were scanned 
using [18F]-AV1451 positron emission tomography as part of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Scans were stratified into four groups 
according to TBI history, and by clinical dementia rating scores into 
cognitively normal (CDR = 0) and those showing cognitive decline (CDR ≥ 0.5). We 
pursued voxel-based group comparison of [18F]-AV1451 uptake to identify the 
effect of TBI history on brain tau deposition, and for voxel-wise correlation 
analyses between [18F]-AV1451 uptake and different neuropsychological measures 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Compared to the TBI-/CDR ≥ 0.5 group, 
the TBI+/CDR ≥ 0.5 group showed increased tau deposition in the temporal pole, 
hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior and middle temporal gyri. Furthermore, 
the extent of tau deposition in the brain of those with TBI history positively 
correlated with the extent of cognitive decline, CSF-tau, and CSF-amyloid. This 
might suggest TBI to increase the risk for tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease 
later in life.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this analysis was to develop a nonlinear disease 
progression model, using an expanded set of covariates that captures the 
longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. These 
were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI-1 study, 
of 301 Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients who were 
followed for 2-3 years.
METHODS: The model describes progression rate and baseline disease score as a 
function of covariates. The covariates that were tested fell into five groups: 
a) hippocampal volume; b) serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers; c) 
demographics and apolipoprotein Epsilon 4 (ApoE4) allele status; d) baseline 
cognitive tests; and e) disease state and comedications.
RESULTS: Covariates associated with baseline disease severity were disease 
state, hippocampal volume, and comedication use. Disease progression rate was 
influenced by baseline CSF biomarkers, Trail-Making Test part A score, delayed 
logical memory test score, and current level of impairment as measured by 
CDR-SB. The rate of disease progression was dependent on disease severity, with 
intermediate scores around the inflection point score of 10 exhibiting high 
disease progression rate. The CDR-SB disease progression rate in a typical 
patient, with late mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease, was 
estimated to be approximately 0.5 and 1.4 points/year, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this model describes disease progression in terms of 
CDR-SB changes in patients and its dependency on novel covariates. The CSF 
biomarkers included in the model discriminate mild cognitive impairment subjects 
as progressors and nonprogressors. Therefore, the model may be utilized for 
optimizing study designs, through patient population enrichment and clinical 
trial simulations.

INTRODUCTION: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the 
earliest Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesion in the brain. Research suggests 
differing functional roles between two EC subregions, the anterolateral EC 
(aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC).
METHODS: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness 
measurements from serial magnetic resonance imaging scans of 775 ADNI-1 
participants (219 healthy; 380 mild cognitive impairment; 176 AD) and use linear 
mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations among cortical 
thickness, disease status, and cognitive measures.
RESULTS: Group status is reliably predicted by aLEC thickness, which also 
exhibits greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. 
Change in aLEC thickness is also associated with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and 
tau levels.
DISCUSSION: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes 
over short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity-it is a 
strong candidate biomarker for detection of early AD.

INTRODUCTION: Analyses of off-label use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
(AChEIs) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has produced mixed results. Post hoc 
analyses of observational cohorts, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI), have reported deleterious effects in AChEI-treated subjects 
(AChEI+). Here, we used neuroimaging biomarkers to determine whether AChEI+ 
subjects had a greater rate of neurodegeneration than untreated (AChEI-) 
subjects while accounting for baseline differences.
METHODS: We selected 121 ADNI MCI AChEI+ subjects and 151 AChEI- subjects with a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; 82 AChEI+ and 110 AChEI- also had a 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scan. A subset (83 AChEI+ and 98 AChEI-) had 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
assessment for amyloid positivity. Linear regression models were used to compare 
the effect of treatment on changes in Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical 
Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scores. We used standard regression in SPM (for 
baseline) and the SPM toolbox sandwich estimator, SwE (for longitudinal) for 
comparisons of AChEI+ and AChEI- FDG PET and MRI data.
RESULTS: At baseline, the AChEI+ group had significantly reduced cortical gray 
matter density (GMD) and more hypometabolism than AChEI- subjects. The greater 
rate of atrophy and hypometabolic changes over time in AChEI+ compared to AChEI- 
subjects did not survive correction for baseline differences. AChEI+ 
participants were more likely to be amyloid-positive and have lower GMD and FDG 
standardized uptake value ratio than AChEI- at baseline. AChEI+ subjects showed 
greater atrophy over time, which remained significant after controlling for 
amyloid status.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that the observed differences in rates of cognitive 
decline, atrophy, and hypometabolism are likely the result of significant 
baseline differences between the groups. Furthermore, the data indicate no 
treatment effect of AChEI (positive of negative), rather that physicians 
prescribe AChEI to subjects who present with more severe clinical impairment. 
This alone may account for the negative effect seen previously in the ADNI 
population of AChEI use among MCI subjects.

Many genetic studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been focused on the 
identification of common genetic variants associated with AD risk and not on 
other aspects of the disease, such as age at onset or rate of dementia 
progression. There are multiple approaches to untangling the genetic 
architecture of these phenotypes. We hypothesized that the genetic architecture 
of rate of progression is different than the risk for developing AD dementia. To 
test this hypothesis, we used longitudinal clinical data from ADNI and the 
Knight-ADRC at Washington University, and we calculated PRS (polygenic risk 
score) based on the IGAP study to compare the genetic architecture of AD risk 
and dementia progression. Dementia progression was measured by the change of 
Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR)-SB per year. Out of the 21 loci for 
AD risk, no association with the rate of dementia progression was found. The PRS 
rate was significantly associated with the rate of dementia progression 
(β= 0.146, p = 0.03). In the case of rare variants, TREM2 (β= 0.309, p = 0.02) 
was also associated with the rate of dementia progression. TREM2 variant 
carriers showed a 23% faster rate of dementia compared with non-variant 
carriers. In conclusion, our results indicate that the recently identified 
common and rare variants for AD susceptibility have a limited impact on the rate 
of dementia progression in AD patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the inflammatory analytes that predict clinical 
progression and evaluate their performance against biomarkers of 
neurodegeneration.
METHODS: A longitudinal study of MCI-AD patients in a Discovery cohort over 
15 months, with replication in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) MCI cohort over 36 months. Fifty-three inflammatory analytes were 
measured in the CSF and plasma with a RBM multiplex analyte platform. 
Inflammatory analytes that predict clinical progression on Clinical Dementia 
Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Mini Mental State Exam scores were 
assessed in multivariate regression models. To provide context, key analyte 
results in ADNI were compared against biomarkers of neurodegeneration, 
hippocampal volume, and CSF neurofilament light (NfL), in receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluating highest quartile of CDR-SB change over 
two years (≥3 points).
RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory analytes in relation to cognitive 
decline were best described by gene ontology terms, natural killer cell 
chemotaxis, and endothelial cell apoptotic process and in plasma, extracellular 
matrix organization, blood coagulation, and fibrin clot formation described the 
analytes. CSF CCL2 was most robust in predicting rate of cognitive change and 
analytes that correlated to CCL2 suggest IL-10 pathway dysregulation. The ROC 
curves for ≥3 points change in CDR-SB over 2 years when comparing baseline 
hippocampal volume, CSF NfL, and CCL2 were not significantly different.
INTERPRETATION: Baseline levels of immune cell chemotactic cytokine CCL2 in the 
CSF and IL-10 pathway dysregulation impact longitudinal cognitive and functional 
decline in MCI-AD. CCL2's utility appears comparable to biomarkers of 
neurodegeneration in predicting rapid decline.

BACKGROUND: As a more common but easily neglected disorder, minimal depressive 
symptoms (MDS), it is unclear whether and why it increases the risk of cognitive 
progression in non-dementia elderly.
METHODS: The Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was 
used to assign 1065 non-dementia elderly into normal control (n = 380) and MDS 
(n = 685) groups via the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Blood neutrophils, 
transcriptomics and metabolomics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics, and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed.
RESULTS: MDS was found to increase the risk of cognitive progression 
independently of multiple psychological symptoms. Increased levels of blood 
neutrophils were associated with cognitive progression in MDS, as supported by 
neutrophil-related pathways by transcriptomic enrichment analysis and 
multi-omics joint analysis. A disrupted frontolimbic circuit was associated with 
neutrophil activation in MDS.
LIMITATIONS: The heterogeneity of the sample limited the generalizability of 
results, and the lack of follow-up data limited the research on the mechanism of 
neutrophil activation influencing cognitive function in MDS.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive progression occurs as early as the MDS stage. And this 
phenomenon may attribute to the neutrophil activation and the related disrupted 
frontolimbic circuit.

Objective: To delineate the relationship between clinical symptoms and tauopathy 
of the hippocampal subfields under different amyloid statuses. Methods: One 
hundred and forty-three subjects were obtained from the ADNI project, including 
87 individuals with normal cognition, 46 with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). All subjects underwent the tau PET, amyloid PET, 
T1W, and high-resolution T2W scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale cognition 13 (ADAS-cog-13) total score, comprising memory and executive 
function scores. The hippocampal subfields including Cornu Ammonis (CA1-3), 
subiculum (Sub), and dentate gyrus (DG), as well as the adjacent 
para-hippocampus (PHC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC), were segmented automatically 
using the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software. The 
relationship between tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal subfields and 
assessment scores was calculated using partial correlation analysis under 
different amyloid status, by controlling age, gender, education, apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) allele ɛ4 carrier status, and, time interval between the acquisition 
time of tau PET and amyloid PET scans. Results: Compared with amyloid negative 
(A-) group, individuals from amyloid positive (A+) group are more impaired based 
on the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE; p = 3.82e-05), memory (p = 
6.30e-04), executive function (p = 0.0016), and ADAS-cog-13 scores (p = 
5.11e-04). Significant decrease of volume (CA1, DG, and Sub) and increase of tau 
deposition (CA1, Sub, ERC, and PHC) of the hippocampal subfields of both 
hemispheres were observed for the A+ group compared to the A- group. Tauopathy 
of ERC is significantly associated with memory score for the A- group, and the 
associated regions spread into Sub and PHC for the A+ group. The relationship 
between the impairment of behavior or executive function and tauopathy of the 
hippocampal subfield was discovered within the A+ group. Leftward asymmetry was 
observed with the association between assessment scores and tauopathy of the 
hippocampal subfield, which is more prominent for the NPI score for the A+ 
group. Conclusion: The associations of tauopathy/volume of the hippocampal 
subfields with clinical symptoms provide additional insight into the 
understanding of local changes of the human HF during the AD continuum and can 
be used as a reference for future studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by cognitive decline and atrophy in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) 
and subsequent brain regions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has 
been widely used in research and clinical care for diagnosis and monitoring AD 
progression. However, atrophy patterns are complex and vary by patient. To 
address this issue, researchers have made efforts to develop more concise 
metrics that can summarize AD-specific atrophy. Many of these methods can be 
difficult to interpret clinically, hampering adoption. In this study, we 
introduce a novel index which we call an "AD-NeuroScore," that uses a modified 
Euclidean-inspired distance function to calculate differences between regional 
brain volumes associated with cognitive decline. The index is adjusted for 
intracranial volume (ICV), age, sex, and scanner model. We validated 
AD-NeuroScore using 929 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) study, with a mean age of 72.7 years (SD = 6.3; 55.1-91.5) and 
cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD diagnoses. Our 
validation results showed that AD-NeuroScore was significantly associated with 
diagnosis and disease severity scores (measured by MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-11) at 
baseline. Furthermore, baseline AD-NeuroScore was associated with both changes 
in diagnosis and disease severity scores at all time points with available data. 
The performance of AD-NeuroScore was equivalent or superior to adjusted 
hippocampal volume (AHV), a widely used metric in AD research. Further, 
AD-NeuroScore typically performed as well as or sometimes better when compared 
to other existing sMRI-based metrics. In conclusion, we have introduced a new 
metric, AD-NeuroScore, which shows promising results in detecting AD, 
benchmarking disease severity, and predicting disease progression. AD-NeuroScore 
differentiates itself from other metrics by being clinically practical and 
interpretable.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between amyloid burden and frequency 
of existing and incidence of new neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in elderly with 
and without cognitive decline.
METHODS: 275 cognitively normal controls (NC), 100 subjective memory complaint 
(SMC), 559 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 143 Alzheimer's disease dementia 
subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative received 
(18F)-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Yearly 
neuropsychiatric inventory (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)/NPI-Questionnaire) 
data were collected from the study partners at each visit. Mean standard uptake 
volume ratios (SUVR) normalised to whole cerebellum were obtained. Positive 
amyloid PET scan was defined as mean SUVR ≥1.17. Fisher's exact test was used to 
compare frequency and incidence between amyloid positive and amyloid negative 
subjects. Survival analyses were used to estimate of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(NPS) between amyloid positive and amyloid negative subjects. Survival analyses 
were used to estimate hazard ratios for developing the most common NPS by 
amyloid status.
RESULTS: No differences in NPS frequency were seen between amyloid positive and 
amyloid negative NC, SMC, MCI or dementia groups. MCI subjects with amyloid 
pathology however tended to have greater frequency x severity (FxS) of anxiety, 
hallucinations, delusions, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor 
behavior, and appetite, but not agitation, depression, night-time disturbances, 
or elation. MCI subjects with amyloid pathology were at greater risk for 
developing apathy, anxiety and agitation over time. Baseline presence of 
agitation and apathy and new onset agitation, irritability and apathy predicted 
faster conversion to dementia among MCI subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid pathology is associated with greater rate of development of 
new NPS in MCI. Anxiety and delusions are significant predictors of amyloid 
pathology. Agitation, irritability and apathy are significant predictors for 
conversion from MCI to dementia.

Dementia can be empirically described by the latent dementia phenotype "δ" and 
its various composite "homologs". We have explored δ's blood-based protein 
biomarkers in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) study. 
However, it would be convenient to replicate those associations in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To this end, we have 
engineered a δ homolog from observed cognitive performance measures common to 
both projects. Our findings were replicated in randomly selected 50% splits of 
TARCC data (Group 1, N = 1,747; Group 2, N = 1,755), and then independently in 
ADNI (N = 1,737). The new δ homolog, i.e., "dT2A" (d-TARCC to ADNI), fit the 
data of both studies well, and was strongly correlated with dementia severity, 
as rated by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale "sum of boxes" (TARCC: r = 0.99, 
p < 0.001; ADNI: r = 0.96, p < 0.001). dT2A achieved an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.981 (0.976-0.985) for the discrimination of 
Alzheimer's disease from normal controls in TARCC, and 0.988 (0.983-0.993) in 
ADNI. dT2A is the 12th δ homolog published to date, and opens the door to 
independent replications across these and similar studies.

Alzheimer's disease has recently been classified using three biological markers 
(amyloid [A], tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) to help elucidate its 
progression. We aimed to investigate whether there were differences between 
cognitive function and the clinical dementia symptoms over time relative to the 
ATN classification in the amyloid-negative group. In the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, 310 participants who underwent all the 
tests required for ATN classification were enrolled. The cognitive function 
score differences (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 
[ADAS-Cog 13], Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB], and Mini-Mental 
State Examination [MMSE]) between the groups were analyzed using the analysis of 
covariance and score changes over time with a linear mixed-effects model. In the 
cross-sectional analysis, ADAS-Cog 13 scores were higher for A-T-N+ and A-T+N+ 
than for A-T-N- (p<0.001) and A-T+N- (p<0.001). In the longitudinal analysis, 
CDR-SOB scores for A-T+N+ deteriorated faster than A-T-N- (p<0.001), A-T+N- 
(p<0.001) and A-T-N+ (p<0.001). Hippocampal atrophy progressed faster in A-T-N+ 
(p<0.001) and A-T+N+ (p=0.02) than in A-T-N-. Through this study, we discovered 
that even in individuals classified as amyloid negative, neurodegeneration with 
tau deposition exacerbates cognitive decline and worsens clinical symptoms, 
underscoring the need for continuous monitoring and observation.

BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) 
commonly coexist, the interaction between two has been of the considerable 
interest.
OBJECTIVE: We determined whether the association of Aβ and tau with cognitive 
decline differs by the presence of significant CSVD.
METHODS: We included 60 subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) from 
Samsung Medical Center and 82 Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment 
(ADCI) from ADNI, who underwent Aβ (florbetaben or florbetapir) and tau 
(flortaucipir, FTP) PET imaging. They were retrospectively assessed for 5.0±3.9 
and 5.6±1.9 years with Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes 
(CDR-SB)/Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mixed effects models were used to 
investigate the interaction between Aβ/tau and group on CDR-SB/MMSE changes.
RESULTS: The frequency of Aβ positivity (45% versus 54.9%, p = 0.556) and mean 
global FTP SUVR (1.17±0.21 versus 1.16±0.17, p = 0.702) were not different 
between the two groups. We found a significant interaction effect of Aβ 
positivity and SVCI group on CDR-SB increase/MMSE decrease 
(p = 0.013/p < 0.001), and a significant interaction effect of global FTP uptake 
and SVCI group on CDR-SB increase/MMSE decrease (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030). 
Finally, the interaction effects of regional tau and group were prominent in the 
Braak III/IV (p = 0.001) and V/VI (p = 0.003) not in Braak I/II region 
(p = 0.398).
CONCLUSION: The association between Aβ/tau and cognitive decline is stronger in 
SVCI than in ADCI. Therefore, our findings suggested that Aβ positivity or tau 
burden (particularly in the Braak III/IV or V/VI regions) and CSVD might 
synergistically affect cognitive decline.

Alzheimer disease (AD) exhibits spatially heterogeneous 3- or 4-repeat tau 
deposition across participants. Our overall goal was to develop an automated 
method to quantify the heterogeneous burden of tau deposition into a single 
number that would be clinically useful. Methods: We used tau PET scans from 3 
independent cohorts: the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease 
Research Center (Mayo, n = 1,290), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI, n = 831), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 
(OASIS-3, n = 430). A machine learning binary classification model was trained 
on Mayo data and validated on ADNI and OASIS-3 with the goal of predicting 
visual tau positivity (as determined by 3 raters following Food and Drug 
Administration criteria for 18F-flortaucipir). The machine learning model used 
region-specific SUV ratios scaled to cerebellar crus uptake. We estimated 
feature contributions based on an artificial intelligence-explainable method 
(Shapley additive explanations) and formulated a global tau summary measure, Tau 
Heterogeneity Evaluation in Alzheimer's Disease (THETA) score, using SUV ratios 
and Shapley additive explanations for each participant. We compared the 
performance of THETA with that of commonly used meta-regions of interest (ROIs) 
using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes, clinical diagnosis, and histopathologic staging. Results: The model 
achieved a balanced accuracy of 95% on the Mayo test set and at least 87% on the 
validation sets. It classified tau-positive and -negative participants with an 
AUC of 1.00, 0.96, and 0.94 on the Mayo, ADNI, and OASIS-3 cohorts, 
respectively. Across all cohorts, THETA showed a better correlation with the 
Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (ρ ≥ 
0.45, P < 0.05) than did meta-ROIs (ρ < 0.44, P < 0.05) and discriminated 
between participants who were cognitively unimpaired and those who had mild 
cognitive impairment with an effect size of 10.09, compared with an effect size 
of 3.08 for meta-ROIs. Conclusion: Our proposed approach identifies positive tau 
PET scans and provides a quantitative summary measure, THETA, that effectively 
captures heterogeneous tau deposition observed in AD. The application of THETA 
for quantifying tau PET in AD exhibits great potential.

OBJECTIVES: In Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research, choosing appropriate method 
for measuring change in cognitive function over time can be challenging. The aim 
for this study was to examine the sensitivity of four neuropsychological tests 
used to measure cognition during the transition from mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to AD, and the impacts of associated covariates.
METHODS: We enrolled 223 patients with MCI who progressed to AD and had 
completed multiple follow-up assessments in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. We constructed nonlinear mixed model for 
multivariate longitudinal data assuming that multiple neuropsychological tests 
would exhibit nonlinear transformation of a common factor in the latent 
cognitive process underlying the progression from MCI to AD.
RESULTS: The Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of the Boxes (CDR-SB) and Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale (11 items; ADAS-11) were more sensitive to cognitive 
changes in individuals with higher cognitive function, the Functional Activities 
Questionnaire (FAQ) was more sensitive to cognitive changes in individuals with 
middle cognitive function, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was more 
sensitive to cognitive changes in individuals with lower cognitive function. 
Gender (p = 0.0139) and educational level (p = 0.0094) had varying effects on 
different tests, such that men performed better on the FAQ and CDR-SB, and 
individuals with higher educational level tended to perform better on the FAQ 
and MMSE.
CONCLUSIONS: When choosing appropriate neuropsychological tests in cognitive 
measurements, the cognitive functional level of the patient as well as the 
impacts of covariates should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Genetic study of quantitative biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
is a promising method to identify novel genetic factors and relevant 
endophenotypes, which provides valuable information to deconvolute mechanistic 
complexity and better understand disease subtypes.
RESULTS: Using the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between 565,373 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 16 key AD biomarkers from 1,576 
subjects at four visits. We identified a novel locus rs5011804 at 12p12.1 
significantly associated with several AD biomarkers, including three cognitive 
traits (CDRSB, FAQ, ADAS13) and one imaging trait (fusiform volume). Additional 
mediation and interaction analyses investigated the relationships among this 
SNP, relevant biomarkers, and clinical diagnosis, confirming and further 
elaborating the genetic effects seen in the GWAS.
CONCLUSION: Our GWAS not only affirms key AD genes but also suggests the 
promising role of the SNP rs5011804 due to its associations with several AD 
cognitive and imaging outcomes. The SNP rs5011804 has a reported association 
with adult asthma and slightly affects intracranial volume but has not been 
associated with AD before. Our novel findings contribute to a more comprehensive 
view of the molecular mechanism behind AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research has shown that elevated blood 
C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with increased Alzheimer disease (AD) 
risk only in APOE ε4 allele carriers; the objective of this study was to examine 
the interactive effects of plasma CRP and APOE genotype on cognition and AD 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study 
were analyzed, including APOE genotype; plasma CRP concentrations; diagnostic 
status (i.e., mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to AD); Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia Staging 
Instrument scores; CSF concentrations of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42), total tau 
(t-Tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau); and amyloid (AV45) PET imaging. 
Multivariable regression analyses tested the associations between plasma CRP and 
APOE on cognitive and biomarker outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 566 ADNI participants, 274 (48.4%) had no, 222 (39.2%) had 1, and 
70 (12.4%) had 2 APOE ε4 alleles. Among only participants who had 2 APOE ε4 
alleles, elevated CRP was associated with lower MMSE score at baseline (β [95% 
confidence interval] -0.52 [-1.01, -0.12]) and 12-month follow-up (β -1.09 
[-1.88, -0.17]) after adjustment for sex, age, and education. The interaction of 
2 APOE ε4 alleles and elevated plasma CRP was associated with increased CSF 
levels of t-Tau (β = 11.21, SE 3.37, p < 0.001) and p-Tau (β = +2.74, SE 1.14, p 
< 0.01). Among those who had no APOE ε4 alleles, elevated CRP was associated 
with decreased CSF t-Tau and p-Tau. These effects were stronger at the 12-month 
follow-up.
DISCUSSION: CRP released during peripheral inflammation could be a mediator in 
APOE ε4-related AD neurodegeneration and serve as a drug target for AD.

BACKGROUND: According to recent studies, amyloid-β (Aβ) isoforms as 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have remarkable predictive value for 
cognitive decline in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we 
aimed to investigate the correlations between several targeted proteomics in CSF 
samples with Aβ ratios and cognitive scores in patients in AD spectrum to search 
for potential early diagnostic utility.
METHODS: A total of 719 participants were found eligible for inclusion. Patients 
were then categorized into cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), and AD and underwent an assessment of Aβ and proteomics. Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), and Mini 
Mental State Exam (MMSE) were used for further cognitive assessment. The Aβ42, 
Aβ42/Aβ40, and Aβ42/38 ratios were considered as means of comparison to identify 
those peptides corresponding significantly to these established biomarkers and 
cognitive scores. The diagnostic utility of the IASNTQSR, VAELEDEK, VVSSIEQK, 
GDSVVYGLR, EPVAGDAVPGPK, and QETLPSK was assessed.
RESULTS: All investigated peptides corresponded significantly to Aβ42 in 
controls. In those with MCI, VAELEDEK and EPVAGDAVPGPK were significantly 
correlated with Aβ42 (p value < 0.001). Additionally, IASNTQSR, VVSSIEQK, 
GDSVVYGLR, and QETLPSK were significantly correlated with Aβ42/Aβ40 and Aβ42/38 
(p value < 0.001) in this group. This group of peptides similarly corresponded 
to Aβ ratios in those with AD. Eventually, IASNTQSR, VAELEDEK, and VVSSIEQK were 
significantly associated with CDR, ADAS-11, and ADAS-13, particularly in MCI 
group.
CONCLUSION: Our research suggests potential early diagnostic and prognostic 
utilities for certain peptides extracted from CSF-targeted proteomics research.

Sleep and related disorders could lead to changes in various brain networks, but 
little is known about the role of amyloid β (Aβ) burden-a key Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) biomarker-in the relationship between sleep disturbance and altered 
resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in older adults. This 
cross-sectional study examined the association between sleep disturbance, Aβ 
burden, and rsFC using a large-scale dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Sample included 489 individuals (53.6% 
cognitively normal, 32.5% mild cognitive impairment, and 13.9% AD) who had 
completed sleep measures (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), PET Aβ data, and 
resting-state fMRI scans at baseline. Within and between rsFC of the Salience 
(SN), the Default Mode (DMN) and the Frontal Parietal network (FPN) were 
compared between participants with sleep disturbance versus without sleep 
disturbance. The interaction between Aβ positivity and sleep disturbance was 
evaluated using the linear regressions, controlling for age, diagnosis status, 
gender, sedatives and hypnotics use, and hypertension. Although no significant 
main effect of sleep disturbance was found on rsFC, a significant interaction 
term emerged between sleep disturbance and Aβ burden on rsFC of SN (β = 0.11, 
P = 0.006). Specifically, sleep disturbance was associated with SN 
hyperconnectivity, only with the presence of Aβ burden. Sleep disturbance may 
lead to altered connectivity in the SN when Aβ is accumulated in the brain. 
Individuals with AD pathology may be at increased risk for sleep-related 
aberrant rsFC; therefore, identifying and treating sleep problems in these 
individuals may help prevent further disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular dysfunction confers risk for functional decline in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the clinical interplay of these two pathogenic 
processes is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: We utilized Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data 
to examine associations between peripherally derived soluble cell adhesion 
molecules (CAMs) and clinical diagnostic indicators of AD.
METHODS: Using generalized linear regression models, we examined cross-sectional 
relationships of soluble plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-Selectin to baseline diagnosis 
and functional impairment (clinical dementia rating sum-of-boxes, CDR-SB) in the 
ADNI cohort (n = 112 AD, n = 396 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 58 
cognitively normal). We further analyzed associations of these biomarkers with 
brain-based AD biomarkers in a subset with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
data (n = 351). p-values derived from main effects and interaction terms from 
the linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between independent 
and dependent variables for significance (significance level was set at 0.05 a 
priori for all analysis).
RESULTS: Higher mean VCAM-1 (p = 0.0026) and ICAM-1 (p = 0.0189) levels were 
found in AD versus MCI groups; however, not in MCI versus cognitively normal 
groups. Only VCAM-1 was linked with CDR-SB scores (p = 0.0157), and APOE ɛ4 
genotype modified this effect. We observed independent, additive associations 
when VCAM-1 and CSF amyloid-β (Aβ42), total tau, phosphorylated tau (P-tau), or 
P-tau/Aβ42 (all < p = 0.01) were combined in a CDR-SB model; ICAM-1 showed a 
similar pattern, but to a lesser extent.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate independent associations of plasma-based 
vascular biomarkers and CSF biomarkers with AD-related clinical impairment.

BACKGROUND: Crucial to the success of clinical trials targeting early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is recruiting participants who are more likely to 
progress over the course of the trials. We hypothesize that a combination of 
plasma and structural MRI biomarkers, which are less costly and non-invasive, is 
predictive of longitudinal progression measured by atrophy and cognitive decline 
in early AD, providing a practical alternative to PET or cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Longitudinal T1-weighted MRI, cognitive (memory-related test scores and 
clinical dementia rating scale), and plasma measurements of 245 cognitively 
normal (CN) and 361 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients from ADNI were 
included. Subjects were further divided into β-amyloid positive/negative 
(Aβ+/Aβ-)] subgroups. Baseline plasma (p-tau181 and neurofilament light chain) 
and MRI-based structural medial temporal lobe subregional measurements and their 
association with longitudinal measures of atrophy and cognitive decline were 
tested using stepwise linear mixed effect modeling in CN and MCI, as well as 
separately in the Aβ+/Aβ- subgroups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analyses were performed to investigate the discriminative power of each model in 
separating fast and slow progressors (first and last terciles) of each 
longitudinal measurement.
RESULTS: A total of 245 CN (35.0% Aβ+) and 361 MCI (53.2% Aβ+) participants were 
included. In the CN and MCI groups, both baseline plasma and structural MRI 
biomarkers were included in most models. These relationships were maintained 
when limited to the Aβ+ and Aβ- subgroups, including Aβ- CN (normal aging). ROC 
analyses demonstrated reliable discriminative power in identifying fast from 
slow progressors in MCI [area under the curve (AUC): 0.78-0.93] and more 
modestly in CN (0.65-0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: The present data support the notion that plasma and MRI biomarkers, 
which are relatively easy to obtain, provide a prediction for the rate of future 
cognitive and neurodegenerative progression that may be particularly useful in 
clinical trial stratification and prognosis. Additionally, the effect in Aβ- CN 
indicates the potential use of these biomarkers in predicting a normal 
age-related decline.

BACKGROUND: The relative performance of semi-quantitative amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers in diagnosing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting the cognitive evolution of patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is still debated.
METHODS: Subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 with 
complete baseline cognitive assessment (Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical 
Dementia Rating [CDR] and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale [ADAS-cog] scores), CSF collection (amyloid-β1-42 [Aβ], tau and 
phosphorylated tau) and 18F-florbetapir scans were included in our 
cross-sectional cohort. Among these, patients with MCI or substantial memory 
complaints constituted our longitudinal cohort and were followed for 
30 ± 16 months. PET amyloid deposition was quantified using relative retention 
indices (standardised uptake value ratio [SUVr]) with respect to pontine, 
cerebellar and composite reference regions. Diagnostic and prognostic 
performance based on PET and CSF was evaluated using ROC analysis, multivariate 
linear regression and survival analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: The cross-sectional study included 677 participants and revealed that 
pontine and composite SUVr values were better classifiers (AUC 0.88, diagnostic 
accuracy 85%) than CSF markers (AUC 0.83 and 0.85, accuracy 80% and 75%, for Aβ 
and tau, respectively). SUVr was a strong independent determinant of cognition 
in multivariate regression, whereas Aβ was not; tau was also a determinant, but 
to a lesser degree. Among the 396 patients from the longitudinal study, 82 (21%) 
converted to AD within 22 ± 13 months. Optimal SUVr thresholds to differentiate 
AD converters were quite similar to those of the cross-sectional study. 
Composite SUVr was the best AD classifier (AUC 0.86, sensitivity 88%, 
specificity 81%). In multivariate regression, baseline cognition (CDR and 
ADAS-cog) was the main predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Pontine and 
composite SUVr were moderate but independent predictors of final status and 
CDR/ADAS-cog progression rate, whereas baseline CSF markers had a marginal 
influence. The adjusted HRs for AD conversion were 3.8 (p = 0.01) for PET 
profile, 1.2 (p = ns) for Aβ profile and 1.8 (p = 0.03) for tau profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Semi-quantitative amyloid PET appears more powerful than CSF 
markers for AD grading and MCI prognosis in terms of cognitive decline and AD 
conversion.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a late-life risk factor for cognitive decline. 
Evidence suggests an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated 
pathologic changes and depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of AT(N) biomarker profile (amyloid-β 
[A], p-tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) and gender on cross-sectional 
associations between subclinical depressive symptoms and cognitive function 
among older adults without dementia.
METHODS: Participants included 868 individuals without dementia from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Depressive symptoms were 
measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). ADNI neuropsychological 
composite scores assessed memory and executive function (EF). PET, cerebrospinal 
fluid, and MRI modalities classified the study sample into biomarker profiles: 
normal biomarkers (A-T-N-), AD continuum (A+T±N±), and suspect non-AD pathology 
(SNAP; A-T±N-or A-T-N±). Multivariate regression models were used to investigate 
associations between GDS and cognitive domains.
RESULTS: GDS was negatively associated with memory (β= -0.156, p < 0.001) and EF 
(β= -0.147, p < 0.001) in the whole sample. When classified by biomarker 
profile, GDS was negatively associated with memory and EF in AD continuum 
(memory: β= -0.174, p < 0.001; EF: β= -0.129 p = 0.003) and SNAP (memory: 
β= -0.172, p = 0.005; EF: β= -0.197, p = 0.001) subgroups. When stratified by 
sex, GDS was negatively associated with memory (β= -0.227, p < 0.001) and EF 
(β= -0.205, p < 0.001) in men only.
CONCLUSION: The association between subclinical depressive symptoms and 
cognitive function is highly influenced by the AT(N) biomarker profile.

IMPORTANCE: As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in 
presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive 
to the earliest disease-related changes.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for 
clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the 
ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC 
combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global 
cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical 
trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
Alzheimer's study).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates 
of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in 
North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had 
normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 
studies.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the 2 studies that collected data on Aβ levels 
(ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "Aβ-positive" placebo 
group and compare them with an "Aβ-negative" group. For the study that did not 
include data on Aβ levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we 
grouped participants by the presence of APOE-ε4 and by clinical progression.
RESULTS: In ADNI, Aβ-positive participants showed more decline than did 
Aβ-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean 
[SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95% CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; P = .02). In AIBL, 
the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95% 
CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95% CI, -2.290 to 
-0.519]; P = .002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-ε4 allele carriers performed 
significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 
[0.294] [95% CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95% 
CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; P = .001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal 
participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are 
significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who 
are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, 
and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95% CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; 
P < .001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per 
group with 30% attrition and a 5% α level, we project 80% power to detect 
effects in the range of Δ = 0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations 
suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with 
the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary 
prevention trials.

OBJECTIVE: We explored whether a history of sleep disorder affected a current 
diagnosis of cognitive impairment and clinical conversion in a non-demented 
elderly population.
METHODS: Comprehensive clinical data collected as part of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was analyzed. A history of sleep disorder 
was recorded in the recent ADNI medical database. Standard clinical and 
neuropsychological tests were performed both at baseline and follow-up visit. 
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed after adjusting for age, 
sex, education, apolipoprotein E ε4 status, vascular risk score, body mass 
index, Geriatric Depression Scale score, and use of sleeping pills.
RESULTS: A total of 391 cognitively normal individuals, 303 with early mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and 364 with late MCI were included. Sleep disorder 
history was significantly associated with an increased risk of MCI but not with 
clinical conversion. A history of insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
significantly increased the risk of MCI, but only an OSA history predicted 
progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a sleep disorder history usefully aids 
early detection of cognitive impairment and emphasize that such sleep disorder, 
particularly OSA, is important as potential target for AD prevention.

BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD) is prevalent in older 
adults. However, it remains unclear whether there are effects of SSD on brain 
aging outcomes (cognition and brain structures), especially in the presence of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology.
METHODS: A total of 1,188 adults without dementia were recruited from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Participants with 
SSD were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). In 
multivariable models, the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of SSD 
with brain aging outcomes were explored. We further evaluated whether baseline 
amyloid-β (Aβ) load modifies the relations between SSD and brain aging outcomes.
RESULTS: SSD at baseline was associated with significantly longitudinal decline 
in cognition and displayed significantly accelerated atrophy in hippocampus 
(β = -29.53, p = 0.001) and middle temporal gyrus (β = - 77.82, p = 0.006) among 
all participants and Aβ-Positive individuals. SSD interacted with baseline Aβ 
load in predicting longitudinal decline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
(β = - 0.327, p = 0.023), episodic memory (β = -0.065, p = 0.004) and increase 
in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognition 13-item scale (ADAS-cog13) 
(β = 0.754, p = 0.026).
LIMITATIONS: Our study didn't look at AD diagnosis but Aβ status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that older people without dementia with both 
SSD and a high level of Aβ load may have higher risk of cognitive deterioration 
and brain atrophy. Therapeutic mitigation of depressive symptoms, especially in 
those with abnormal Aβ levels, may help delay progressive decline in cognition.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are prevalent in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and commonly measured using the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Based on existing exploratory literature, we 
report preliminary validation of three NPI Questionnaire (NPI-Q-10) subscales 
that measure clinically meaningful symptom clusters.
METHODS: Cross-sectional results for three subscales (NPI-Q-4-Frontal, 
NPI-Q-4-Agitation/Aggression, NPI-Q-3-Mood) in amnestic MCI and AD dementia 
cases from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) databases were analyzed using 
confirmatory unrotated principal component analysis.
RESULTS: ADNI contributed 103 MCI, 90 MCI converters, and 112 AD dementia cases, 
whereas NACC contributed 1,042 MCI, 763 MCI converters, and 3,048 AD dementia 
cases. NACC had higher baseline mean age (75.7 versus 74.6), and more impaired 
mean scores (at month 24) on Mini-Mental State Exam (19.5 versus 22.4) and 
NPI-Q-10 (5.0 versus 4.3), and all NPI-Q subscales than ADNI. Medians were not 
different between cohorts for NPI-Q-4-Agitation/Aggression, and NPI-Q-3-Mood, 
however. Each item on all scales/subscales contributed variance in principal 
component analysis Pareto plots. All items in Factor (F) 1 for each 
scale/subscale projected in a positive direction on biplots (revealing 
coherence), whereas F2 and F3 items showed more spatial separation (revealing 
independence). There were remarkable similarities between cohorts for factor 
loadings and spatial patterns of item projections, although factor item 
identities varied somewhat, especially beyond F1.
CONCLUSION: The similar pattern of results across two cohorts support validity 
of these subscales, which are worthy of further psychometric evaluation in MCI 
and AD patients and preliminary application in clinical settings.

Recent changes in diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) state that 
biomarkers can enhance certainty in a diagnosis of AD. In the present study, we 
combined cognitive function and brain morphology, a potential imaging biomarker, 
to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. We identified four 
biomarkers, or cortical signatures of cognition (CSC), from regressions of 
cortical thickness on neuropsychological factors representing memory, executive 
function/processing speed, language, and visuospatial function among 
participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
Neuropsychological factor scores were created from a previously validated 
multidimensional factor structure of the neuropsychological battery in ADNI. 
Mean thickness of each CSC at the baseline study visit was used to evaluate risk 
of conversion to clinical AD among participants with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and rate of decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) score. Of 307 MCI participants, 119 converted to AD. For all 
domain-specific CSC, a one standard deviation thinner cortical thickness was 
associated with an approximately 50% higher hazard of conversion and an increase 
of approximately 0.30 points annually on the CDR-SB. In combined models with a 
domain-specific CSC and neuropsychological factor score, both CSC and factor 
scores predicted conversion to AD and increasing clinical severity. The present 
study indicated that factor scores and CSCs for memory and language both 
significantly predicted risk of conversion to AD and accelerated deterioration 
in dementia severity. We conclude that predictive models are best when they 
utilize both neuropsychological measures and imaging biomarkers.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and validate a radiomics-integrated model 
with whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the progression of 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: 357 patients with MCI were selected from the ADNI database, which is an 
open-source database for AD with multicentre cooperation, of which 154 
progressed to AD during the 48-month follow-up period. Subjects were divided 
into a training and test group. For each patient, the baseline T1WI MR images 
were automatically segmented into white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), and radiomics features were extracted from each tissue. Based on 
the data from the training group, a radiomics signature was built using logistic 
regression after dimensionality reduction. The radiomics signatures, in 
combination with the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) and baseline neuropsychological 
scales, were used to build an integrated model using machine learning. The 
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and data of the test group were 
used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the model, 
respectively. In addition, the clinical prognostic efficacy of the model was 
evaluated based on the time of progression from MCI to AD.
RESULTS: Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the APOE4, clinical 
dementia rating, AD assessment scale, and radiomics signature were independent 
predictors of MCI progression to AD. The integrated model was constructed based 
on independent predictors using machine learning. The ROC curve showed that the 
accuracy of the model in the training and the test sets was 0.814 and 0.807, 
with a specificity of 0.671 and 0.738, and a sensitivity of 0.822 and 0.745, 
respectively. In addition, the model had the most significant diagnostic 
efficacy in predicting MCI progression to AD within 12 months, with an AUC of 
0.814, sensitivity of 0.726, and specificity of 0.798.
CONCLUSION: The integrated model based on whole-brain radiomics can accurately 
identify and predict the high-risk population of MCI patients who may progress 
to AD. Radiomics biomarkers are practical in the precursory stage of such 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Recently, two monoclonal antibodies that lower amyloid plaques have 
shown promising results for the treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These treatments require the 
identification of cognitively impaired older adults with biomarker evidence of 
AD pathology using CSF biomarkers or amyloid-PET. Previous studies showed plasma 
biomarkers (plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181) and hippocampal volume from 
structural MRI correlated with brain amyloid pathology. We hypothesized plasma 
biomarkers with hippocampal volume would identify patients who are suitable 
candidates for disease-modifying therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of plasma AD biomarkers and hippocampal 
atrophy to detect MCI or AD with amyloid pathology confirmed by amyloid-PET or 
CSF biomarkers in ADNI.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative. Participants were aged 55-90 years old with plasma biomarker and 
structural MRI brain data.
MEASUREMENTS: The optimum cut-off point for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and NFL 
and the performance of combined biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy for detecting 
cognitive impairment with brain amyloid pathology were evaluated. The 
association between baseline plasma biomarkers and clinical progression, defined 
by CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and diagnostic conversion over two years, was 
evaluated using a Weibull time-to-event analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 428 participants were included; 167 had normal cognition, 
245 had MCI, and 16 had mild AD. Among MCI and AD, 140 participants had elevated 
amyloid levels by PET or CSF. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 provided the best accuracy 
(sensitivity 79%, specificity 66%, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.77) to detect drug 
candidate participants at baseline. Combined plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and 
hippocampal atrophy increased the specificity for diagnosis (96%), but had lower 
sensitivity (34%), and AUC (0.65). Hippocampal atrophy combined with the 
abnormal plasma p-tau181 or hippocampal atrophy alone showed high sensitivity to 
detect clinical progression (by CDR-SB worsening) of the drug-candidate 
participants within the next 2 years (sensitivity 93% and 89%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers and structural MRI can help identify patients who 
are currently eligible for anti-amyloid treatment and are likely to progress 
clinically, in cases where amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers are not available.

Clinical procedure for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is mainly based on 
clinical records and short cognitive tests. However, low suspicion and 
difficulties in understanding test cut-offs make diagnostic accuracy being low, 
particularly in primary care. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are suitable to 
design computed aided diagnostic systems because of their features of generating 
relationships between variables and their learning capability. The main aim 
pursued in that work is to explore the ability of a hybrid ANN-based system in 
order to provide a tool to assist in the clinical decision-making that 
facilitates a reliable MCI estimate. The model is designed to work with 
variables usually available in primary care, including Minimental Status 
Examination (MMSE), Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS), age, and years of education. It will be useful in any 
clinical setting. Other important goal of our study is to compare the diagnostic 
rendering of ANN-based system and clinical physicians. A sample of 128 MCI 
subjects and 203 controls was selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). The ANN-based system found the optimal variable combination, 
being AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility index (CUI) 
calculated. The ANN results were compared with those from medical experts which 
include two family physicians, a neurologist, and a geriatrician. The optimal 
ANN model reached an AUC of 95.2%, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity 
of 84.78% and was based on MMSE, FAQ, and age inputs. As a whole, physician 
performance achieved a sensitivity of 46.66% and a specificity of 91.3%. CUIs 
were also better for the ANN model. The proposed ANN system reaches excellent 
diagnostic accuracy although it is based only on common clinical tests. These 
results suggest that the system is especially suitable for primary care 
implementation, aiding physicians work with cognitive impairment suspicions.

INTRODUCTION: We present the Brain-Age Score (BAS) as a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)-based index for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed a fully 
automated framework for estimating the BAS in healthy controls (HCs) and 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD, using MRI scans.
METHODS: We trained the proposed framework using 385 HCs from the IXI and OASIS 
datasets and evaluated 146 HCs, 102 stable-MCI (sMCI), 112 progressive-MCI 
(pMCI), and 147 AD patients from the J-ADNI dataset. We used a correlation test 
to determine the association between the BAS and four traditional screening 
tools of AD: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Ratio 
(CDR), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score (ADAS), and Functional Assessment 
Questionnaire (FAQ). Furthermore, we assessed the association between BAS and 
anatomical MRI measurements: the normalized gray matter (nGM), normalized white 
matter (nWM), normalized cerebrospinal fluid (nCSF), mean cortical thickness as 
well as hippocampus volume.
RESULTS: The correlation results demonstrated that the BAS is in line with 
traditional screening tools of AD (i.e., the MMSE, CDR, ADAS, and FAQ scores) as 
well as anatomical MRI measurements (i.e., nGM, nCSF, mean cortical thickness, 
and hippocampus volume).
DISCUSSION: The BAS may be useful for diagnosing the brain atrophy level and can 
be a reliable automated index for clinical applications and neuropsychological 
screening tools.

OBJECTIVE: To examine neuroanatomical changes associated with depressive 
symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the relationship between brain 
structure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in depressed and 
non-depressed patients.
METHODS: Two independent cohorts were used in this study. The first cohort (KI) 
was collected from the Memory Clinic at Karolinska University Hospital and 
consisted of 41 AD patients. The second cohort was selected and downloaded from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI) and consisted of 
148 patient. Patients underwent medical, neuropsychological assessment, 
laboratory analyses of CSF, including β amyloid 1-42 (Aβ 42), total τ (t-τ), 
phosphorylated τ 181 (p-τ) and brain MRI examination. In the KI cohort, 
depression was assessed using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, and 
in the ADNI cohort the Geriatric Depression Scale was applied. 3D T1-weighted 
MRI images were processed using automated steps for segmentation and surface 
reconstruction implemented in Freesurfer. General linear model analysis was used 
as a statistical approach.
RESULTS: Cortical thinning in AD patients with depressive symptoms compared with 
those without was observed in the left parietal and temporal brain regions in 
both cohorts. Negative correlation between cortical thickness and t-τ was 
greater in depressed compared with non-depressed AD patients in precuneus and 
parahippocampal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms in AD patients are 
associated with cortical thinning in temporal and parietal regions. In addition, 
our findings suggest that τ protein pathology in these areas may contribute to 
the development of depressive symptoms in AD.

Brain iron accumulation, which is indicated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
ferritin, is associated with the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). 
Studies have indicated that iron deposition might participate in Alzheimer's 
pathology through the induction of microglial activation. A soluble triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTrem2) in CSF is increasingly recognized 
as a reliable indicator for microglia activity in the brain and participates in 
the development of neuroinflammation. However, the association between CSF 
ferritin and sTrem2 under the AD continuum has not been well-established. We 
enrolled individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Participants were classified into healthy controls (HC, n = 46) and AD 
continuum (n = 105) in the combined strata of Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration 
(ATN) mode and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) criteria. The associations between 
CSF ferritin (indicating iron burden) and sTrem2, as well as AD pathology, which 
is reflected by Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau in CSF, were explored. CSF ferritin was 
significantly associated with sTrem2 among all participants (β = 0.517, P < 
0.001, FDR < 0.001), HC (β = 0.749, P = 0.006, FDR = 0.010), and AD continuum (β 
= 0.488, P < 0.001, FDR < 0.001), respectively. However, ferritin predicted the 
accelerated sTrem2 level in those with high ferritin (β = 0.549, P = 0.036, FDR 
= 0.045). In conclusion, CSF ferritin serves as a potential biomarker of 
Trem2-indicated microglia function.

The relationship between mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is intricate and still not well investigated. The purpose of the 
study is to examine the roles of the AD imaging pathologies in modulating the 
associations of MBI with cognitive impairments. We analyzed 1129 participants 
(563 [49.86%] female), who had measures of Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire (NPI-Q), cognition, and amyloid PET AD biomarkers from the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We assess the longitudinal 
neuropathological and clinical correlates of baseline MBI via linear mixed 
effects and Cox proportional hazard models. The mediation analyses were used to 
test the mediation effects of AD pathologies on cognition. We found that MBI was 
associated with worse global cognition as represented by Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) (p < 0.001), and higher β-amyloid burden (p < 0.001). 
β-amyloid partially mediated the effects of MBI on cognition with the mediation 
percentage varied from 14.67 to 40.86% for general cognition, memory, executive, 
and language functions for non-dementia individuals. However, no significant 
associations were discovered between MBI and tau burden or neurodegeneration. 
Furthermore, longitudinal analyses revealed that individuals with MBI had a 
faster increase in brain amyloid burden (p < 0.001) and a higher risk of 
clinical conversion (HR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.45 to 4.01 p < 0.001). In conclusion, 
MBI could be an imperative prediction indicator of clinical and pathological 
progression. In addition, amyloid pathologies might partially mediate the 
influences of MBI on cognitive impairments and AD risk.

OBJECTIVE: To identify white matter fiber injury and network changes that may 
lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression, then a joint model was 
constructed based on neuropsychological scales to predict high-risk individuals 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression among older adults with MCI.
METHODS: A total of 173 MCI patients were included from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database and randomly divided into training and 
testing cohorts. Forty-five progressed to AD during a 4-year follow-up period. 
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques extracted relevant DTI quantitative 
features for each patient. In addition, brain networks were constructed based on 
white matter fiber bundles to extract network property features. Ensemble 
dimensionality reduction was applied to reduce both DTI quantitative features 
and network features from the training cohort, and machine learning algorithms 
were added to construct white matter signature. In addition, 52 patients from 
the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database were used for 
external validation of white matter signature. A joint model was subsequently 
generated by combining with scale scores, and its performance was evaluated 
using data from the testing cohort.
RESULTS: Based on multivariate logistic regression, clinical dementia rating and 
Alzheimer's disease assessment scales (CDRS and ADAS, respectively) were 
selected as independent predictive factors. A joint model was constructed in 
combination with the white matter signature. The AUC, sensitivity, and 
specificity in the training cohort were 0.938, 0.937, and 0.91, respectively, 
and the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in the test cohort were 0.905, 0.923, 
and 0.872, respectively. The Delong test showed a statistically significant 
difference between the joint model and CDRS or ADAS scores (P < 0.05), yet no 
significant difference between the joint model and the white matter signature 
(P = 0.341).
CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that a joint model combining 
neuropsychological scales can be constructed by using machine learning and DTI 
technology to identify MCI patients who are at high-risk of progressing to AD.

Objectives: Neuropsychological tests are an important basis for the memory 
impairment diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, multiple memory tests 
might be conflicting within-subjects and lead to uncertain diagnoses in some 
cases. This study proposed a framework to diagnose the uncertain cases of memory 
impairment. Methods: We collected 2,386 samples including AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and cognitive normal (CN) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and three different neuropsychological 
tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale, and Clinical Dementia Rating) from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A deep learning (DL) framework using 
FDG-PET was proposed to diagnose uncertain memory impairment cases that were 
conflicting between tests. Subsequent ANOVA, chi-squared, and t-test were used 
to explain the potential causes of uncertain cases. Results: For certain cases 
in the testing set, the proposed DL framework outperformed other methods with 
95.65% accuracy. For the uncertain cases, its positive diagnoses had a 
significant (p < 0.001) worse decline in memory function than negative diagnoses 
in a longitudinal study of 40 months on average. In the memory-impaired group, 
uncertain cases were mainly explained by an AD metabolism pattern but mild in 
extent (p < 0.05). In the healthy group, uncertain cases were mainly explained 
by a non-energetic mental state (p < 0.001) measured using a global 
deterioration scale (GDS), with a significant depression-related metabolism 
pattern detected (p < 0.05). Conclusion: A DL framework for diagnosing uncertain 
cases of memory impairment is proposed. Proved by longitudinal tracing of its 
diagnoses, it showed clinical validity and had application potential. Its valid 
diagnoses also provided evidence and explanation of uncertain cases based on the 
neurodegeneration and depression mental state.

Subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show loss of cognitive functions and 
change in behavioral and functional state affecting the quality of their daily 
life and that of their families and caregivers. A neuropsychological assessment 
plays a crucial role in detecting such changes from normal conditions. However, 
despite the existence of clinical measures that are used to classify and 
diagnose AD, a large amount of subjectivity continues to exist. Our aim was to 
assess the potential of machine learning in quantifying this process and 
optimizing or even reducing the amount of neuropsychological tests used to 
classify AD patients, also at an early stage of impairment. We investigated the 
role of twelve state-of-the-art neuropsychological tests in the automatic 
classification of subjects with none, mild, or severe impairment as measured by 
the clinical dementia rating (CDR). Data were obtained from the ADNI database. 
In the groups of measures used as features, we included measures of both 
cognitive domains and subdomains. Our findings show that some tests are more 
frequently best predictors for the automatic classification, namely, LM, 
ADAS-Cog, AVLT, and FAQ, with a major role of the ADAS-Cog measures of delayed 
and immediate memory and the FAQ measure of financial competency.

This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional associations between 
regional Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including tau, β-amyloid (Aβ), and 
brain volume, within the Papez circuit, and neuropsychological functioning 
across the preclinical and clinical spectrum of AD. We utilized data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 251 
Aβ-positive participants. Participants were categorized into three groups based 
on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR): 73 individuals with preclinical AD 
(CDR = 0), 114 with prodromal AD (CDR = 0.5), and 64 with clinical AD dementia 
(CDR ≥ 1). Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, gender, and education 
years, were employed to evaluate the associations between five regions of 
interest (the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior 
cingulate cortex, and thalamus) and five neuropsychological tests across the 
three imaging modalities. In the preclinical stage of AD, flortaucipir PET was 
associated with impaired global cognition and episodic memory (range 
standardized β = 0.255-0.498, p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons), 
while florbetapir PET and brain volume were marginally related to global 
cognition (range standardized β = 0.221-0.231, p < 0.05). In the clinical stages 
of AD (prodromal and dementia), both increased flortaucipir uptake and decreased 
brain volume were significantly associated with poorer global neuropsychological 
and episodic memory performance (range standardized β = 0.222-0.621, p < 0.05, 
most regions of interest survived correction for multiple comparisions). 
However, a slight relationship was observed between florbetapir uptake and 
poorer global cognitive function. The regions most affected by flortaucipir PET 
were the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. During 
the clinical stages, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibited the most 
significant volumetric changes. Tau PET and brain volume measurements within the 
Papez circuit are more sensitive indicators of early cognitive deficits in AD 
than Aβ PET. Furthermore, during the clinical stages of AD, both flortaucipir 
PET and brain volume of the Papez circuit are closely correlated with cognitive 
decline. These findings underscore the importance of integrating multiple 
biomarkers for the comprehensive evaluation of AD pathology and its impact on 
cognition.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether depression and apathy are independently 
associated with longitudinal trajectories of cortical atrophy in the entorhinal 
cortex compared with frontal subregions previously implicated in late-life mood 
disturbance.
METHODS: Data from 334 participants classified as having mild cognitive 
impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were 
analyzed by using multilevel models for change adjusted for age, global 
cognitive status, and total intracranial volume at enrollment. Participants in 
ADNI were recruited from >50 clinical research sites in the United States and 
Canada. Depression and apathy were identified by informants using the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was 
performed on 1.5-Tesla scanners according to the standardized ADNI-1 protocol on 
an average of 5 occasions over an average of 30.5 months. Regional cortical 
thickness values were derived from longitudinal data processing in FreeSurfer 
version 4.4.
RESULTS: Depression was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the 
entorhinal cortex at baseline and accelerated atrophy in the anterior cingulate 
cortex. Similar relationships between depression and the orbitofrontal cortex 
and between apathy and the anterior cingulate cortex were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In mild cognitive impairment, depression signs are a better marker 
of longitudinal cortical atrophy than apathy. Results are consistent with 
hypotheses that depression is an early sign of a more aggressive 
neurodegenerative process or that depression lowers brain reserve capacity, 
allowing for more rapid progression of Alzheimer disease neuropathology.

INTRODUCTION: Possession of the apolipoprotein E (APO E) ε4 allele advances 
amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and symptomatic onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
whereas its effect on the rate of cognitive decline remained controversial. We 
examined the effects of APOE ε4 allele on cognition in biomarker-confirmed late 
mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and mild AD subjects in the Japanese 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) and North American ADNI 
(NA-ADNI).
METHODS: The "early AD" (ie, combined LMCI and mild AD) cohort of 649 subjects 
from J-ADNI and NA-ADNI were selected based on positivity of Aβ confirmed by 
amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid testing. The 
rates of cognitive decline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the 
Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog) from baseline were examined 
using mixed-effects model. The effect of ε4 on time to conversion to dementia 
was also analyzed in LMCI using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test.
RESULTS: The rates of cognitive decline were not significantly different between 
ε4 carriers and ε4 non-carriers in the total early AD cohort, which were 
affected neither by region nor by the number of ε4 alleles. In LMCI, ε4 carriers 
showed almost the same progression rates as ε4 non-carriers, except for a 
significantly faster decline in MMSE (P = .0282). Time to conversion to demenita 
was not significantly different between ε4 carriers and ε4 non-carriers. In 
ε4-positive mild AD, the rates of decline in MMSE (P = .003) and CDR-SB 
(P = .0071) were slower than those in ε4 non-carriers.
DISCUSSION: The APOE ε4 allele had little effect on the rates of cognitive 
decline in the overall biomarker-confirmed early AD, regardless of region and 
number of ε4 alleles, with a slight variability in different clinical stages, 
the ε4 allele being slightly accelerative in LMCI, while decelerative in mild 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Emerging therapies have shown promising results for slowing the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the potential impact of these 
therapies on real-world outcomes remains to be explored.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of slowing AD progression on functional 
abilities and behavioral symptoms.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform 
Data Set (UDS) in the United States (06/2005-11/2021, primary analysis) and the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (09/2005-03/2022, 
sensitivity analysis) were used.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia, 
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score 0.5-9.0 (inclusive; 
first visit defined as the index date), and confirmed amyloid positivity were 
identified in NACC. In ADNI, individuals with at least one clinical center visit 
with a clinical assessment of MCI or mild dementia and confirmed amyloid 
positivity were identified.
MEASUREMENTS: Hypothetical effects of slowing disease progression as assessed by 
CDR-SB on functional and behavioral outcomes including the Functional Activities 
Questionnaire (FAQ) score, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) 
score, and the probability of complete dependence over five years were evaluated 
using multivariable regression among NACC participants, separately for the 
subgroups with MCI and mild dementia at baseline, respectively. For the ADNI 
sensitivity analysis, the hypothetical effects of slowing disease progression 
were evaluated for FAQ score using multivariable regression among the MCI 
participants only.
RESULTS: Compared with natural disease progression, slowing progression by 20% 
over five years for NACC participants with MCI and mild dementia, respectively, 
would result in 1.7-point (10.8%) and 1.6-point (12.9%) less deterioration based 
on FAQ; 0.5-point (20.3%) and 0.5-point (19.3%) less deterioration based on 
NPI-Q; 4.7 percentage-point (22.2%) and 10.1 percentage-point (21.6%) lower 
probability of complete dependence. Among ADNI participants, delaying disease 
progression by 20% or 30% over 4 years would avert deterioration based on FAQ of 
1.1 points (20.4%) and 1.6 points (29.6%), respectively, compared to natural 
disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Slowing early AD progression could result in preservation of 
functional and behavioral attributes and functional autonomy for longer.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive and 
irreversible dementia, and accurate diagnosis of AD at its prodromal stage is 
clinically important. Currently, computer-aided diagnosis of AD and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) using 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission 
tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features 
or deep learning methods, which have difficulties in achieving sufficient 
classification accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore 
aimed to implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics, to 
improve the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can 
reveal pathological information.
METHODS: In this study, 18F-FDG PET and clinical assessments were collected in a 
cohort of 422 individuals [including 130 with AD, 130 with MCI, and 162 healthy 
controls (HCs)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
44 individuals (including 22 with AD, and 22 HCs) from Huashan Hospital, 
Shanghai, China. First, we performed a group comparison using a two-sample 
Student's t test to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) based on 30 AD 
patients and 30 HCs from ADNI cohorts. Second, based on two time scans of 32 HCs 
from ADNI cohorts, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficient for radiomic feature 
stability analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficients were regarded as a 
feature selection criterion, to select effective features associated with the 
clinical cognitive scale [clinical dementia rating scale in its sum of boxes 
(CDRSB); Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)] with 500-times 
cross-validation. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to test the 
ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD patients.
RESULTS: As a result, we identified brain regions which were mainly distributed 
in the temporal, occipital and frontal areas as ROIs. A total of 168 radiomic 
features of AD were stable (alpha > 0.8). The classification experiment led to 
maximal accuracies of 91.5%, 83.1% and 85.9% for classifying AD versus HC, MCI 
versus HCs and AD versus MCI.
CONCLUSION: The research in this paper proved that the novel approach based on 
high-order radiomic features extracted from 18F-FDG PET brain images that can be 
used for AD and MCI computer-aided diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) may involve oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a 
circulating protein that intersects both these pathways, since its expression is 
increased during the acute phase response, and the protein acts to lower 
pro-oxidant iron in cells. Since the role of Cp in AD, and its potential for use 
as a biomarker is not established, we investigated CSF Cp and its association 
with longitudinal outcome measures related to AD.
METHODS: This was an observational study of 268 people from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) cohort. Subjects were classified clinically as 
having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or were cognitively normal (CN), and 
were also classified as being positive for β-amyloid using established 
thresholds in the CSF t-tau/Aβ42 ratio. Subjects underwent cognitive tests and 
MRI studies every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly thereafter for up to 
6 years.
RESULTS: At baseline, CSF Cp was not associated with clinical or pathological 
diagnosis, but we found an unexpected association between CSF Cp and levels of 
CSF apolipoprotein E. In longitudinal analysis, high level of CSF Cp was 
associated with accelerated cognitive decline (as assessed by ADAS-Cog, CDR-SB, 
and MMSE) and ventricular volume enlargement in people classified as MCI and who 
had underlying β-amyloid pathology.
CONCLUSION: These results raise new questions into the role of Cp in 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and APOE pathways involved in AD, and 
reveal the potential for this protein to be used as a biomarker in disease 
prognostication.

The study objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain 
stimulation (DBS) at the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) region to 
specifically modulate frontal lobe behavioral and cognitive networks as a novel 
treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This is a 
non-randomized phase I prospective open label interventional trial of three 
subjects with matched comparison groups. AD participants given DBS for at least 
18 months at the VC/VS target were compared on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum 
of Boxes (CDR-SB), our primary outcome clinical measure, to matched groups 
without DBS from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Serial 
2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images 
of AD participants were also compared longitudinally over time. Three AD DBS 
participants were matched to subjects from the ADNI cohort. All participants 
tolerated DBS well without significant adverse events. All three AD DBS 
participants had less performance decline and two of them meaningfully less 
decline over time on our primary outcome measure, CDR-SB, relative to matched 
comparison groups from the ADNI using score trajectory slopes. Minimal changes 
or increased metabolism on FDG-PET were seen in frontal cortical regions after 
chronic DBS at the VC/VS target. The first use of DBS in AD at a frontal lobe 
behavior regulation target (VC/VS) was well-tolerated and revealed less 
performance decline in CDR-SB. Frontal network modulation to improve executive 
and behavioral deficits should be furthered studied in AD.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the complex connection between chronic sleep 
disturbance (CSD) and cognitive progression.
METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was 
used to assign 784 non-dementia elderly into two groups: a normal sleep group 
(528 participants) and a CSD group (256 participants) via the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory (NPI)-sleep subitem. Blood transcriptomics, blood neutrophil, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
neutrophil-related inflammatory factors were measured. We also investigated gene 
set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Cox proportional hazards model for risk factors, 
and mediation and interaction effects between indicators. Cognitive progression 
is defined as the progression from cognitively normal to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI)/dementia or from MCI to dementia.
RESULTS: CSD could significantly affect cognitive function. The activated 
neutrophil pathways for cognitive progression in CSD were identified by 
transcriptomics GSEA, which was reflected by increased blood neutrophil level 
and its correlation with cognitive progression in CSD. High tau burden mediated 
the influence of neutrophils on cognitive function and exacerbated the 
CSD-related risk of left hippocampal atrophy. Elevated neutrophil-related 
inflammatory factors were observed in the cognitive progression of CSD and were 
associated with brain tau burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Activated neutrophil pathway triggering tau pathology may underline 
the mechanism of cognitive progression in CSD.

Disease-onset time (DOT) and disease trajectory concepts were applied to derive 
an Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression population model using the clinical 
dementia rating scale-sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) from the AD neuroimaging initiative 
(ADNI) database. The model enabled the estimation of a DOT and a disease 
trajectory for each patient. The model also allowed distinguishing fast and 
slow-progressing subpopulations according to the functional assessment 
questionnaire, normalized hippocampal volume, and CDR-SOB score at study entry. 
On the basis of these prognostic factors, 81% of the mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) subjects could correctly be assigned to slow or fast progressers, and 77% 
of MCI to AD conversions could be predicted whereas the model described 
correctly 84% of the conversions. Finally, synchronization of the biomarker-time 
profiles on estimated individual DOT virtually expanded the population 
observation period from 3 to 8 years. DOT-disease trajectory model is a powerful 
approach that could be applied to many progressive diseases.CPT: Pharmacometrics

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that cortical and hippocampal volumes, 
measured in vivo from volumetric MRI (vMRI) scans, could be used to identify 
variant subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and to prospectively predict the rate 
of clinical decline.
METHODS: Amyloid-positive participants with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1 and ADNI2 with baseline MRI scans (n = 229) and 
2-year clinical follow-up (n = 100) were included. AD subtypes (hippocampal 
sparing [HpSpMRI], limbic predominant [LPMRI], typical AD [tADMRI]) were defined 
according to an algorithm analogous to one recently proposed for tau 
neuropathology. Relationships between baseline hippocampal volume to cortical 
volume ratio (HV:CTV) and clinical variables were examined by both continuous 
regression and categorical models.
RESULTS: When participants were divided categorically, the HpSpMRI group showed 
significantly more AD-like hypometabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (p < 
0.05) and poorer baseline executive function (p < 0.001). Other baseline 
clinical measures did not differ across the 3 groups. Participants with HpSpMRI 
also showed faster subsequent clinical decline than participants with LPMRI on 
the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, 13-Item Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire 
(all p < 0.05) and tADMRI on the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) (both p < 0.05). Finally, a larger HV:CTV was associated with poorer 
baseline executive function and a faster slope of decline in CDR-SB, MMSE, and 
ADAS-Cog13 score (p < 0.05). These associations were driven mostly by the amount 
of cortical rather than hippocampal atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: AD subtypes with phenotypes consistent with those observed with tau 
neuropathology can be identified in vivo with vMRI. An increased HV:CTV ratio 
was predictive of faster clinical decline in participants with AD who were 
clinically indistinguishable at baseline except for a greater dysexecutive 
presentation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive episodic memory 
dysfunction. A prominent hallmark of AD is gradual brain atrophy. Despite 
extensive research on brain pathology, the understanding of spinal cord 
pathology in AD and its association with cognitive decline remains understudied. 
We analyzed serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the ADNI data 
repository to assess whether progressive cord atrophy is associated with 
clinical worsening. Cervical cord morphometry was measured in 45 patients and 49 
cognitively normal controls (CN) at two time points over 1.5 years. Regression 
analysis examined associations between cord atrophy rate and cognitive 
worsening. Cognitive and functional activity performance declined in patients 
during follow-up. Compared with controls, patients showed a greater rate of 
decline of the anterior-posterior width of the cross-sectional cord area per 
month (- 0.12%, p = 0.036). Worsening in the mini-mental state examination 
(MMSE), clinical dementia rating (CDR), and functional assessment questionnaire 
(FAQ) was associated with faster rates of cord atrophy (MMSE: r = 0.320, 
p = 0.037; CDR: r = - 0.361, p = 0.017; FAQ: r = - 0.398, p = 0.029). 
Progressive cord atrophy occurs in AD patients; its rate over time being 
associated with cognitive and functional activity decline.

INTRODUCTION: Use of cognitive composites as primary outcome measures is 
increasingly common in clinical trials of preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Composite outcomes can decrease intra-individual variability, 
resulting in improved sensitivity to detect longitudinal change and increased 
statistical power. We developed a novel composite outcome, the ADAS-Cog-Exec, 
for use in the EXERT trial-a Phase 3 randomized, controlled, 12-month exercise 
intervention in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Three combinations of cognitive measures selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale version 13 (ADAS-Cog13), tests of 
executive function, and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were created based on 
previously documented sensitivity to longitudinal change in MCI and to the 
effects of exercise. Optimally weighted composites of each combination were 
modeled using data from the ADNI-1 MCI cohort. Ten-fold cross-validation was 
performed to obtain a bias-corrected mean to standard deviation ratio (MSDR). 
The cognitive composites were assessed for their sensitivity to detect 12-month 
change in MCI.
RESULTS: The MSDR of 12-month change for each of the composite outcomes tested 
exceeded that of the ADAS-Cog13 total score. The composite with the highest MSDR 
(MSDR = 0.48) and associated statistical power included scores on ADAS-Cog13 
Word Recall, Delayed Word Recall, Orientation, and Number Cancellation subtests; 
Trail-Making Tests A & B, Digit Symbol Substitution and Category Fluency; and 
cognitive components of the CDR (Memory, Orientation, Judgement & Problem 
Solving).
DISCUSSION: An optimally weighted cognitive composite measure was identified and 
validated for use in EXERT. This composite contained selected subtests from the 
ADAS-Cog13, additional measures of executive function, and box scores for 
cognitive components of the CDR. Because this composite score demonstrated high 
sensitivity to longitudinal change in MCI it will be used as the primary outcome 
measure for the EXERT trial.

elevated risk of cognitive impairment in non-demented older adults. Given that 
hippocampal and middle temporal gyrus atrophy have been shown to cause SSD, our 
study aimed to investigate the effect of hippocampal volume on the association 
between SSD and cognitive impairment.
METHODS: 338 non-demented older adults from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative) cohort who underwent cognitive assessments, 
questionnaires on depressive symptoms and MRI brain were studied. SSD group is 
defined as a score of 1-5 based on Geriatric Depression Scale scores. We 
conducted causal mediation analyses to investigate the effect of hippocampal 
volume on cognitive performance cross-sectionally.
RESULTS: The SSD group displayed lower left and right hippocampal volume 
(p<0.01) than the non-SSD group. SSD was linked to poorer cognition and smaller 
hippocampal volume. We found that hippocampal volume partially mediated the 
effect of SSD on cognitive performance including the global cognition and the 
cognitive section of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, with mediation 
percentages ranging from 6.45 % to 30.46 %. In addition, we found that the 
thickness of the left middle temporal, right entorhinal and right fusiform 
gyrus, brain regions linked to AD, mediate the relationship between SSD and 
cognition with mediation percentages ranging from 8.67 % to 21.44 %.
LIMITATIONS: Our article didn't differentiate between mild cognitive impairment 
and normal population.
CONCLUSION: The associations of SSD and cognitive impairment are linked to 
alterations in Alzheimer's Disease related brain regions.

BACKGROUND: There is a clear need for simple and effective tests to identify 
individuals who are most likely to develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both for the 
purposes of clinical trial recruitment but also for improved management of 
patients who may be experiencing early pre-clinical symptoms or who have 
clinical concerns.
OBJECTIVES: To predict individuals at greatest risk of progression of cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease in individuals from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using a polygenic risk scoring algorithm. 
To compare the performance of a PRS algorithm in predicting cognitive decline 
against that of using the pTau/Aß1-42 ratio CSF biomarker profile.
DESIGN: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative study conducted across over 50 sites in the US and 
Canada.
SETTING: Multi-center genetics study.
PARTICPANTS: 515 subjects who upon entry to the study were diagnosed as 
cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment.
MEASUREMENTS: Use of genotyping and/or whole genome sequencing data to calculate 
polygenic risk scores and assess ability to predict subsequent cognitive decline 
as measured by CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog13 over 4 years.
RESULTS: The overall performance for predicting those individuals who would 
decline by at least 15 ADAS-Cog13 points from a baseline mild cognitive 
impairment in 4 years was 72.8% (CI:67.9-77.7) AUC increasing to 79.1% (CI: 
75.6-82.6) when also including cognitively normal participants. Assessing mild 
cognitive impaired subjects only and using a threshold of greater than 0.6, the 
high genetic risk participant group declined, on average, by 1.4 points (CDR-SB) 
more than the low risk group over 4 years. The performance of the PRS algorithm 
tested was similar to that of the pTau/Aß1-42 ratio CSF biomarker profile in 
predicting cognitive decline.
CONCLUSION: Calculating polygenic risk scores offers a simple and effective way, 
using DNA extracted from a simple mouth swab, to select mild cognitively 
impaired patients who are most likely to decline cognitively over the next four 
years.

Elucidating the mechanisms by which late-life neurodegeneration causes cognitive 
decline requires understanding why some individuals are more resilient than 
others to the effects of brain change on cognition (cognitive reserve). 
Currently, there is no way of measuring cognitive reserve that is valid (e.g. 
capable of moderating brain-cognition associations), widely accessible (e.g. 
does not require neuroimaging and large sample sizes), and able to provide 
insight into resilience-promoting mechanisms. To address these limitations, this 
study sought to determine whether a machine learning approach to combining 
standard clinical variables could (i) predict a residual-based cognitive reserve 
criterion standard and (ii) prospectively moderate brain-cognition associations. 
In a training sample combining data from the University of California (UC) Davis 
and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI-2) cohort (N = 
1665), we operationalized cognitive reserve using an MRI-based residual 
approach. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm was trained to 
predict this residual reserve index (RRI) using three models: Minimal (basic 
clinical data, such as age, education, anthropometrics, and blood pressure), 
Extended (Minimal model plus cognitive screening, word reading, and depression 
measures), and Full [Extended model plus Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and 
Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale]. External validation was performed in an 
independent sample of ADNI 1/3/GO participants (N = 1640), which examined 
whether the effects of brain change on cognitive change were moderated by the 
machine learning models' cognitive reserve estimates. The three machine learning 
models differed in their accuracy and validity. The Minimal model did not 
correlate strongly with the criterion standard (r = 0.23) and did not moderate 
the effects of brain change on cognitive change. In contrast, the Extended and 
Full models were modestly correlated with the criterion standard (r = 0.49 and 
0.54, respectively) and prospectively moderated longitudinal brain-cognition 
associations, outperforming other cognitive reserve proxies (education, word 
reading). The primary difference between the Minimal model-which did not perform 
well as a measure of cognitive reserve-and the Extended and Full models-which 
demonstrated good accuracy and validity-is the lack of cognitive performance and 
informant-report data in the Minimal model. This suggests that basic clinical 
variables like anthropometrics, vital signs, and demographics are not sufficient 
for estimating cognitive reserve. Rather, the most accurate and valid estimates 
of cognitive reserve were obtained when cognitive performance data-ideally 
augmented by informant-reported functioning-was used. These results indicate 
that a dynamic and accessible proxy for cognitive reserve can be generated for 
individuals without neuroimaging data and gives some insight into factors that 
may promote resilience.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety, apathy and depression are common in subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and may herald Alzheimer's disease (AD). We 
investigated whether these symptoms correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
markers for AD in subjects with MCI. Method Subjects with MCI (n=268) were 
selected from the 'Development of screening guidelines and criteria for 
pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease' (DESCRIPA) and Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies. We measured amyloid β(1-42) protein 
(Aβ42) and total tau (t-tau) in CSF. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were measured 
with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were reported by 55 subjects (21%), anxiety by 35 
subjects (13%) and apathy by 49 subjects (18%). The presence of anxiety was 
associated with abnormal CSF Aβ42 [odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 1.6-3.3] and t-tau (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.9-3.6) concentrations and with the 
combination of abnormal concentrations of both Aβ42 and t-tau (OR 3.1, 95% CI 
2.0-4.7). The presence of agitation and irritability was associated with 
abnormal concentrations of Aβ42 (agitation: OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3; 
irritability: OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.3). Symptoms of depression and apathy were 
not related to any of the CSF markers.
CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with MCI, symptoms of anxiety, agitation and 
irritability may reflect underlying AD pathology, whereas symptoms of depression 
and apathy do not.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a large multi-center 
study designed to develop optimized methods for acquiring longitudinal 
neuroimaging, cognitive, and biomarker measures of AD progression in a large 
cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with Mild Cognitive 
Impairment, and healthy controls. Detailed neuropsychological testing was 
conducted on all participants. We examined the factor structure of the ADNI 
Neuropsychological Battery across older adults with differing levels of clinical 
AD severity based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). Confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA) of 23 variables from 10 neuropsychological tests resulted 
in five factors (memory, language, visuospatial functioning, attention, and 
executive function/processing speed) that were invariant across levels of 
cognitive impairment. Thus, these five factors can be used as indicators of 
cognitive function in older adults who are participants in ADNI.

BACKGROUND: According to the new 'AT(N)' system, those with a normal amyloid 
biomarker but with abnormal tauopathy or biomarkers of neurodegeneration or 
neuronal injury, have been labeled suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology 
(SNAP). We aimed to estimate the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories 
of SNAP individuals in non-demented elders and its comparison with individual in 
the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology using 'AT(N)' system.
METHODS: We included individuals with available baseline cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ (A), CSF phosphorylated tau examination (T) and 18F-uorodeoxyglucose 
PET or volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (N) from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database. Longitudinal change in clinical outcomes are 
assessed using linear mixed effects models. Conversion risk from cognitively 
normal (CN) to cognitively impairment, and conversion from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to dementia are assessed using multivariate Cox proportional 
hazard models.
RESULTS: Totally, 366 SNAP individuals were included (114 A-T-N-, 154 A-T + N-, 
54 A-T-N + and 44 A-T + N+) of whom 178 were CN and 188 were MCI. Compared with 
A-T-N-, CN elders with A-T + N-, A-T-N + and A-T + N + had a faster rate of 
ADNI-MEM score decline. Moreover, CN older individuals with A-T + N + also had a 
faster rate of decline in ADNI-MEM score than those with A-T + N- individuals. 
MCI patients with A-T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF decline 
and hippocampal volume loss compared with A-T-N- and A-T + N- profiles. CN older 
individuals with A-T + N + had an increased risk of conversion to cognitive 
impairment (CDR-GS ≥ 0.5) compared with A-T + N- and A-T-N-. In MCI patients, 
A-T + N + also had an increased risk of conversion to dementia compared with A-T 
+ N- and A-T-N-. Compared with A-T + N-, CN elders and MCI patients with A + T + 
N- and A + T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM score, ADNI-EF score decline, 
and hippocampal volume loss. CN individuals with A + T + N + had a faster rate 
of ADNI-EF score decline compare with A-T + N + individuals. Moreover, MCI 
patients with A + T + N + also had a faster rate of decline in ADNI-MEM score, 
ADNI-EF score and hippocampal volume loss than those with A-T + N + individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from clinical, imaging and biomarker studies on SNAP, 
and its comparison with AD pathophysiology offered an important foundation for 
future studies.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined whether, among subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), women progressed at faster rates than men.
METHODS: We examine longitudinal rates of change from baseline in 398 MCI 
subjects (141 Females, 257 Males) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative-1 (ADNI-1), followed for up to 8 years (mean 4.1±2.5 years) using 
mixed effects models incorporating all follow ups (mean 8±4 visits).
RESULTS: Women progressed at faster rates than men on ADAS-Cog (p=0.001) and 
CDR-SB (p=0.003). Quadratic fit for change over time was significant for both 
ADAS-Cog (p=0.001) and CDR-SB (p=0.004), and the additional acceleration in 
women was 100% for ADAS-Cog and 143% for CDR-SB. The variability of change was 
greater in women. The gender effect was greater in ApoE4 carriers.
DISCUSSION: Women with MCI have greater longitudinal rates of cognitive and 
functional progression than men. Studies to confirm and uncover potential 
mechanisms appear to be warranted.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, with the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) serving 
significant roles in monitoring its progression. We hypothesize that while 
cognitive assessment scores can detect AD-related brain changes, the targeted 
brain regions may differ. Additionally, given AD's strong association with 
aging, we propose that specific brain regions are influenced by both AD 
pathology and aging, exhibiting strong correlations with both. To test these 
hypotheses, we developed a 3D convolutional network with a mixed-attention 
mechanism to recognize AD subjects from structural magnetic resonance imaging 
(sMRI) data and utilize 3D convolutional methods to pinpoint brain regions 
significantly correlated with the AD, MMSE, CDR and age. All models were trained 
and internally validated on 417 samples from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the classification model was externally 
validated on 382 samples from the Australian Imaging and Lifestyle flagship 
(AIBL). This approach provided robust support for using MMSE and CDR in 
assessing AD progression and visually illustrated the relationship between aging 
and AD. The analysis revealed correlations among the four identification tasks 
(AD, MMSE, CDR and age) and highlighted asymmetric brain lesions in both AD and 
aging. Notably, we found that AD can accelerate aging to some extent, and a 
significant correlation exists between the rate of aging and cognitive 
assessment scores. This offers new insights into the relationship between AD and 
aging.

IMPORTANCE: Among cognitively normal individuals, elevated brain amyloid 
(defined by cerebrospinal fluid assays or positron emission tomography regional 
summaries) can be related to risk for later Alzheimer-related cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize and quantify the risk for Alzheimer-related cognitive 
decline among cognitively normal individuals with elevated brain amyloid.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Exploratory analyses were conducted with 
longitudinal cognitive and biomarker data from 445 cognitively normal 
individuals in the United States and Canada. Participants were observed from 
August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016, for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile 
range, 2.0-4.2 years; maximum follow-up, 10.3 years) as part of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
EXPOSURES: Individuals were classified at baseline as having normal (n = 243) or 
elevated (n = 202) brain amyloid using positron emission tomography amyloid 
imaging or a cerebrospinal fluid assay of amyloid β.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included scores on the Preclinical 
Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; a sum of 4 baseline standardized z scores, 
which decreases with worse performance), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0 
[worst] to 30 [best] points), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum of 
Boxes; 0 [best] to 18 [worst] points), and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (0 
[worst] to 25 [best] story units).
RESULTS: Among the 445 participants (243 with normal amyloid, 202 with elevated 
amyloid), mean (SD) age was 74.0 (5.9) years, mean education was 16.4 (2.7) 
years, and 52% were women. The mean score for PACC at baseline was 0.00 (2.60); 
for MMSE, 29.0 (1.2); for CDR-Sum of Boxes, 0.04 (0.14); and for Logical Memory 
Delayed Recall, 13.1 (3.3). Compared with the group with normal amyloid, those 
with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores at 4 years on the PACC (mean 
difference, 1.51 points [95% CI, 0.94-2.10]; P < .001), MMSE (mean difference, 
0.56 points [95% CI, 0.32-0.80]; P < .001), and CDR-Sum of Boxes (mean 
difference, 0.23 points [95% CI, 0.08-0.38]; P = .002). For Logical Memory 
Delayed Recall, between-group score was not statistically significant at 4 years 
(mean difference, 0.73 story units [95% CI, -0.02 to 1.48]; P = .056).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort 
followed up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in baseline brain 
amyloid level, compared with normal brain amyloid level, was associated with 
higher likelihood of cognitive decline, although the findings are of uncertain 
clinical significance. Further research is needed to assess the clinical 
importance of these differences and measure longer-term associations.

The objective of this study was to develop new risk classifications for 
conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing the relative reliability of 
classifiers in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The 397 MCI 
subjects and all baseline data, including characteristics, neuropsychological 
tests, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and MRI findings in Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were used for analysis by Cox proportional 
hazard regression, bootstrap sampling, and c-index. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis revealed the following factors to be associated with increased risk of 
conversion from MCI to AD during the 53-month follow-up period: AVLT 30-minute 
delayed recall, AVLT trial 1, Boston naming, logical delayed recall, 
trail-making B, CDR-sob, ADAS13, the cortical thickness of the right inferior 
temporal lobe (st91ta), and the left hippocampus volume. The combinations of 
ADAS13 at a cutoff point of 15.67 with CDR-sob at 1.5 or with the cortical 
thickness of the right inferior temporal lobe at 2.56 mm3 produced high 
conversion rates of 92.7% (82.4%-100.0%) and 88.8% (77.3%-100.0%), respectively, 
at 48 months. The discriminative ability based on c-index for the proposed 
combination was 0.68. The sample size was estimated as 504 in the group with a 
combination of ADAS13 and CDR-sob whose conversion rate is highest. The 
combination of ADAS13 with CDR-sob at an optimal cutoff point has a high 
reliability in classifying the MCI patients into high- and low-risk conversion 
to AD and will be benefit for patients' assessment and potentially facilitate 
the clinical development of novel therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate factors that predict 
progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to probable 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: We studied the usefulness of quantitative assessment of amyloid 
burden measured by Florbetapir PET scan.
METHODS: The study cohort consisted of aMCI participants older than 65 and those 
with available Florbetapir PET scan at diagnosis from the ADNI database 
(http://adni.loni.usc.edu). To assess the prognostic impact of amyloid burden, a 
staging system based on the global SUVr of the PET scan was applied. We defined 
the stages as: stage I, negative amyloid scan; stage II, positive amyloid in 1st 
tertile; stage III, positive amyloid in 2nd tertile; and stage IV, positive 
amyloid in 3rd tertile.
RESULTS: Of 250 eligible aMCI subjects (age 74.1±5.4, female n = 105), 71 
(28.4%) were diagnosed with probable AD within 3 years. Higher amyloid stages 
showed faster cognitive decline by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In multivariate Cox 
analysis, with stage I as a reference, the hazard ratio (HR) increased as the 
stage increased: stage II (HR, 4.509; p = 0.015), stage III (HR, 7.616; 
p = 0.001), and stage IV (HR, 9.421; p < 0.001). Along with amyloid stage, ApoE 
ɛ4 (HR, 1.943; p = 0.031), score of CDR-SB (HR, 1.845; p < 0.001) and ADAS 11 
(HR, 1.144; p < 0.001), and hippocampal volume (HR, 0.002; p = 0.005) were also 
identified as predictors of dementia progression in aMCI subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Large amyloid burden measured from amyloid PET scan could be a 
predictor of faster cognitive decline in aMCI patients.

BACKGROUND: We used the database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) to explore the psychometric properties of the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) to consider its utility as an outcome 
measure for clinical trials in early and mild, as well as later, stages of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We assessed internal consistency, structural validity, convergent 
validity, and 2-year internal and external responsiveness of the CDR-SB using 
data from 382 subjects with early or mild AD at entry into the ADNI study.
RESULTS: The CDR-SB assesses both cognitive and functional domains of AD 
disability. Mean scores declined nearly linearly; CDR-SB cognitive and 
functional subsums contributed equally to total scores at both very mild (early) 
and mild stages of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The CDR-SB has psychometric properties that make it attractive as a 
primary outcome measure that comprehensively assesses both cognitive and 
functional disability in AD patients. It may prove particularly useful for 
studies in early, predementia stages of AD.

BACKGROUND: Models that can predict brain amyloid beta (Aβ) status more 
accurately have been desired to identify participants for clinical trials of 
preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, potential heterogeneity between 
different cohorts and the limited cohort size have been the reasons preventing 
the development of reliable models applicable to the Asian population, including 
Japan.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to propose a novel approach to predict preclinical AD while 
overcoming these constraints, by building models specifically optimized for ADNI 
or for J-ADNI, based on the larger samples from A4 study data.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective study including cognitive 
normal participants (CDR-global = 0) from A4 study, Alzheimer Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Japanese-ADNI (J-ADNI) cohorts.
MEASUREMENTS: The model is made up of age, sex, education years, history of AD, 
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 
score, and APOE genotype, to predict the degree of amyloid accumulation in 
amyloid PET as Standardized Uptake Value ratio (SUVr). The model was at first 
built based on A4 data, and we can choose at which SUVr threshold configuration 
the A4-based model may achieve the best performance area under the curve (AUC) 
when applied to the random-split half ADNI or J-ADNI subset. We then evaluated 
whether the selected model may also achieve better performance in the remaining 
ADNI or J-ADNI subsets.
RESULT: When compared to the results without optimization, this procedure showed 
efficacy of AUC improvement of up to approximately 0.10 when applied to the 
models "without APOE;" the degree of AUC improvement was larger in the ADNI 
cohort than in the J-ADNI cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained AUC had improved mildly when compared to the AUC in 
case of literature-based predetermined SUVr threshold configuration. This means 
our procedure allowed us to predict preclinical AD among ADNI or J-ADNI 
second-half samples with slightly better predictive performance. Our optimizing 
method may be practically useful in the middle of the ongoing clinical study of 
preclinical AD, as a screening to further increase the prior probability of 
preclinical AD before amyloid testing.

BACKGROUND: The Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A (TMT-A) is a good measure of 
performance on cognitive processing speed. This study aimed to perform a 
genome-wide association study of TMT-A in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A total of 757 individuals with TMT-A phenotypes and 620,901 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. AD related cognitive phenotypes 
include TMT-A, TMT-B, Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS13). Multivariable linear regression analysis 
of TMT-A was conducted using PLINK software. The most TMT-A associated gene was 
tested with Color Trails Test 1 Form A (CTTA), a culturally fair analog of the 
TMT-A. Functional annotation of SNPs was performed using the RegulomeDB and 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases.
RESULTS: The best signal with TMT-A was rs1108010 (p = 4.34 × 10-8) at 11p15.2 
within INSC gene, which was also associated with TMT-B, FAQ, CDR-SB, and ADAS13 
(p = 2.47 × 10-4, 8.56 × 10-3, 0.0127 and 0.0188, respectively). Furthermore, 
suggestive loci were identified such as FOXD2 and CLTA with TMT-A, GBP1/GBP3 
with TMT-B, GRIK2 with FAQ, BAALC and CCDC146 with CDR-SB, BAALC and NKAIN2 with 
ADAS13. Additionally, the best SNP within INSC associated with CTTA was 
rs7931705 (p = 6.15 × 10-5). Several SNPs had significant eQTLs using GTEx.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified several genes/loci associated with TMT-A and AD 
related phenotypes. These findings offer the potential for new insights into the 
pathogenesis of cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Higher late-life body mass index (BMI) was associated with reduced 
risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which might be explained by a reverse causal 
relationship.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether weight loss was a preclinical manifestation of 
AD pathologies and could be a predictor of cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A total of 1,194 participants (mean age = 73.2 [range: 54 to 91] years, 
female = 44.5%) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were 
grouped according to AD biomarker profile as indicated by amyloid (A) and tau 
(TN) status and clinical stage by clinical dementia rating (CDR). BMI across the 
biomarker-defined clinical stages was compared with Bonferroni correction. 
Pearson correlation analysis was performed to test the relationship between the 
amyloid change by PET and the BMI change. Multiple regression models were used 
to explore the influences of amyloid pathologies on BMI change as well as the 
effects of weight loss on longitudinal changes of global cognitive function.
RESULTS: BMI was significantly decreased in AD preclinical stage (amyloid 
positive [A+] and CDR = 0) and dementia stage (A+/TN+ and CDR = 0.5 or 1), 
compared with the healthy controls (A-/TN-and CDR = 0, p < 0.005), while no 
significant differences were observed between preclinical AD and AD dementia. 
Amyloid PET change was inversely correlated with BMI change (p = 0.023, β= -14). 
Individuals in amyloid positive group exhibited faster weight loss (time×group 
interaction p = 0.019, β= -0.20) compared to the amyloid negative group. Greater 
weight loss predicted higher risk of developing cognitive disorders.
CONCLUSION: Elders who experienced greater weight loss might belong to 
preclinical stage of AD and could be targeted for primary prevention of the 
disease.

AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the factors that underpin 
neuropsychiatric symptoms and how they might evolve over time in people with 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.
BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are psychiatric and behavioural 
manifestations that occur in people with AD. These are highly prevalent along 
the continuum of the disease, including at the stage of MCI, as well as before 
cognitive decline. Various small- and large-scale projects have investigated the 
underlying factors that underpin these symptoms; however, the identification of 
clear clusters is still a matter of debate; furthermore, no study has 
investigated how the clusters might change across the development of AD 
pathology by comparing different time points.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the factors that underpin 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) and to assess how the loadings might differ based on 
considerations such as the disease stage of the samples.
METHODS: Data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
database (adni. loni.usc.edu), using scores from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, 
followed up yearly from baseline until month 72. Participant groups included 
those with MCI or AD dementia, or a mixture of both, with all participants 
presenting with at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. A series of exploratory 
Principal Component and Factor (Principal Axis) Analyses were performed using 
Direct Oblimin rotation.
RESULTS: The best-fitting structure was interpreted for each time point. A 
consistent, unique structure could not be identified, as the factors were 
unstable over time, both within the MCI and AD groups. However, some symptoms 
showed a tendency to load on the same factors across most measurements (i.e., 
agitation with irritability, depression with anxiety, elation with 
disinhibition, delusions with hallucinations).
CONCLUSION: Although the analyses revealed some degree of co-occurrence of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms across time points/samples, there was also 
considerable variation. In the AD group, more discrete syndromes were evident at 
the early time points, whereas a more complex picture of co-occurring symptoms, 
with differences likely reflecting disease staging, was seen at later time 
points. As a clear and distinctive factor structure was not consistently 
identified across time points/ samples, this highlights the potential importance 
of sample selection (e.g., disease stage and/or heterogeneity) when studying, 
for example, the neurobiological underpinnings of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the factors including 
neuropsychological test performances and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
which can predict disease progression of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a 
Japanese population.
METHODS: The group classification on early AD population in both Japanese 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) and North American ADNI 
(NA-ADNI) was performed using the inclusion criteria including brain amyloid 
positivity on positron emission tomography or CSF. Participants with early AD 
from each cohort were stratified into two groups based on a cutoff 1.0 of 
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) change at month 24 (m24): 
participants in "progress group" have CDR-SB change ≥ 1.0 and participants in 
"stable group" have CDR-SB change < 1.0. Then, we performed identification of 
prognostic factors from baseline items including neuropsychological scores 
(Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale[ADAS-cog 13], Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), CDR, FAQ, and Geriatric Depression Scale ), CSF markers (t-tau, p-tau, 
and beta-amyloid 1-42), vital signs (body weight, pulse rate, etc.,), by using 
two statistical approaches, Welch's t-test and simple linear regression by 
ordinary least squares. Comparisons between participants with J-ADNI and 
participants with NA-ADNI were also performed.
RESULTS: Trends of CDR-SB changes were very similar between J-ADNI and NA-ADNI 
early AD population enrolled in this study. Baseline levels of CSF t-tau, p-tau, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, FAQ, and ADAS-cog13 were identified as prognostic 
factors in both J-ADNI and NA-ADNI. Based on a detailed subscale analysis on 
ADAS-cog13, four subscales (Q1: word recall, Q3: construction, Q4: delayed word 
recall, and Q8: word recognition) were identified as prognostic factors in both 
J-ADNI and NA-ADNI.
DISCUSSION: Characterizing population with early AD can provide benefits for 
promoting efficiency in conducting AD clinical trials for disease-modifying 
treatments. Thus, implementing these prognostic factors into clinical trials may 
be potentially a good method to enrich participants with early AD who are 
suitable for evaluating treatment effects.

INTRODUCTION: Both the loss of awareness for cognitive decline (a. k.a 
anosognosia) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, even in prodromal stages, and may exacerbate 
functional impairment and negatively impact caregiver burden. Despite the high 
impact of these symptoms on patients and their caregivers, our knowledge of how 
they develop across the AD spectrum is limited. Here, we explored the 
cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between anosognosia and NPS in 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We included 237 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) with a baseline clinical diagnosis of MCI. Everyday Cognition 
(ECog) questionnaire scores were used to measure complaints from participants 
and study-partners at baseline and annually over a mean of 4.29 years [standard 
deviation (SD) = 2.72]. Anosognosia was defined as the study-partner having an 
ECog score ≥2.5/4 and the participant having an ECog score < 2.5/4 on their 
baseline measure and their last observation without more than two consecutive 
deviating observations during the follow-up period. The 12-item 
study-partner-rated Neuropsychiatric Inventory determined the presence or 
absence of specific NPS. Survival analyses were performed to analyze the 
frequency and temporal onset of NPS over time in individuals with and without 
anosognosia.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight out of 237 participants displayed anosognosia. Groups had 
similar lengths of follow-up at baseline (p > 0.9), though participants with 
anosognosia had lower MMSE scores (p = 0.049) and a higher proportion of 
amyloid-positivity using PET (p < 0.001. At baseline, the frequencies of 
agitation (p = 0.029) and disinhibition (p < 0.001) were higher in the 
anosognosia group compared to the non-anosognosia group. Survival analyses 
showed earlier onset of seven of the 12 NPS in the anosognosia group (p's < 
0.001).
DISCUSSION: Loss of awareness for cognitive decline is associated with greater 
frequency and earlier onset of NPS over time in participants with MCI. These 
results support the hypothesis of a potential common underlying 
neurophysiological process for anosognosia and NPS, a finding that needs to be 
addressed in future studies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of 
abnormal proteins, such as β-amyloid and tau, in the brain, which precedes 
cognitive impairment. Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk 
factor for AD, few studies have investigated how the presence of DM affects the 
sequential pathogenesis of AD, specifically within the 
amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) and cognition framework.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the trajectories of ATN biomarkers in 
relation to the presence of DM in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD.
DESIGN: Participants with normal cognition (CN) or mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) at baseline were included. Subjects were followed for 12-192 months, with 
neuroimaging and cognitive assessments conducted at every 12 or 24 months.
SETTING: This study utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 603 participants aged 55-90 years were included, 
comprising 284 CN (25 with DM, 259 without DM) and 319 MCI (39 with DM, 280 
without DM) individuals.
MEASUREMENTS: ATN biomarkers were identified using florbetapir positron emission 
tomography (PET), flortaucipir PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
respectively. Cognition was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
Boxes (CDR-SB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Moderation analysis was 
conducted to investigate the effect of DM on the association between ATN 
biomarkers of AD.
RESULTS: Elevated amyloid standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were 
associated with increased tau levels in the hippocampus, and this association 
was significantly enhanced by the presence of DM in MCI participants 
(p = 0.021). DM also strengthened the association between increased tau SUVR 
levels and neurodegeneration (indicated by decreased entorhinal cortical 
volumes; p = 0.005) in those with MCI. Furthermore, DM enhanced the association 
of decreased entorhinal (p = 0.012) and middle temporal cortex (p = 0.031) 
volumes with increased (worsened) CDR-SB scores in MCI participants. However, DM 
did not predict significant longitudinal changes in ATN pathology or cognitive 
decline in CN participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DM may increase the risk of AD by 
accelerating each step of the A-T-N cascade in the prodromal stage of AD, 
underscoring the importance of DM management in preventing the MCI conversion to 
AD.

The present study aims at investigating if the association between amyloid-β and 
longitudinal cognitive decline in cognitively healthy elderly is modulated by 
resilience capacity. Resilience capacity was quantified by education, which is a 
common proxy of resilience and has been shown to be related to a wide range of 
behaviors promoting resilience. Analyses were conducted with longitudinal 
cognitive data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 276 
cognitively healthy older individuals (≥56 years) were included in the study. 
Baseline amyloid pathology was quantified using CSF amyloid-β 1-42 measurements. 
Longitudinal cognitive decline was assessed using ADAS13, Clinical Dementia 
Rating - Sum of Boxes, and ADNI-Memory composite scores. Duration of follow-up 
was 10 years (mean follow-up: 2.6 years). Linear mixed effects models 
demonstrated stronger cognitive decline over time with increasing baseline 
amyloid. Subsequent mixed-effects analyses showed that this amyloid-related 
cognitive decline is stronger in individuals with lower resilience capacity 
(i.e., lower levels of education). Of note, this effect was not an artifact of 
differences in neurodegeneration patterns between individuals with lower and 
higher resilience. Results suggest that resilience capacity has high potential 
to counteract early amyloid pathology and to significantly slow cognitive 
decline.

The Argentina-Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (Arg-ADNI) study is a 
longitudinal prospective cohort of 50 participants at a single institution in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina. Longitudinal assessments on a neuropsychological test 
battery were performed on 15 controls, 24 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
patients and 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients. In our study 
population, there was a high prevalence of positive AD biomarkers in the AD 
group, 92.3% (12/13); and a low prevalence in the normal controls, 20%; almost 
half (48%) of the patients diagnosed with MCI had positive amyloid detection. 
After a one year, the significant differences found at baseline on 
neuropsychological testing were similar at the follow-up assessment even though 
the AD group had significantly altered its functional performance (FAQ and CDR). 
The exception was semantic fluency, which showed greater impairment between the 
AD group and MCI and normal controls respectively. For these tests, the addition 
of AD biomarkers as a variable did not significantly alter the variations 
previously found for the established clinical group's model. Finally, the 
one-year conversion rate to dementia was 20% in the MCI cohort.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the presence of practice effects in persons with 
Alzheimer disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to evaluate how 
practice effects affect cognitive progression and the outcome of clinical 
trials.
METHODS: Using data from a meta-database consisting of 18 studies including 
participants from the Alzheimer disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and the 
Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with ADAS-Cog11 as the primary 
outcome, we defined practice effects based on the improvement in the first two 
ADAS-Cog11 scores and then estimated the presence of practice effects and 
compared the cognitive progression between participants with and without 
practice effects. The robustness of practice effects was investigated using CDR 
SB, an outcome independent the definition itself. Furthermore, we evaluated how 
practice effects can affect sample size estimation.
RESULTS: The overall percent of practice effects for AD participants was 39.0% 
and 53.3% for MCI participants. For AD studies, the mean change from baseline to 
2 years was 12.8 points for the non-practice effects group vs 7.4 for the 
practice effects group; whereas for MCI studies, it was 4.1 for non-practice 
effects group vs 0.2 for the practice effects group. AD participants without 
practice effects progressed 0.9 points faster than those with practice effects 
over a period of 2 years in CDR-SB; whereas for MCI participants, the difference 
is 0.7 points. The sample sizes can be different by over 35% when estimated 
based on participants with/without practice effects.
CONCLUSION: Practice effects were prevalent and robust in persons with AD or MCI 
and affected the cognitive progression and sample size estimation. Planning of 
future AD or MCI clinical trials should account for practice effects to avoid 
underpower or considers target trials or stratification analysis based on 
practice effects.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the complex connection between 
apathy and cognitive decline that remains unclear. A total of 1057 non-dementia 
elderly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 
received up to 13 years of follow-up and were divided into an apathy negative 
(-) group of 943 participants and an apathy positive (+) group of 114 
participants through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-apathy subitem. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and amyloid β (Aβ) PET were measured, 
and their longitudinal changes were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. 
Risk factors for cognitive decline and apathy conversion were explored through 
the Cox proportional hazards model. Mediation effects of Aβ pathology on 
cognition were investigated using the causal mediation analysis. Apathy syndrome 
was associated with faster impairment of cognition and elevation of the Aβ 
burden. The effects of apathy on cognitive function and life quality were 
mediated by Aβ pathology, including CSF Aβ42/total tau ratio, and Aβ deposition 
in the prefrontal regions. Apathy syndrome was the risk factor for cognitive 
deterioration; meanwhile, frontal Aβ burden was the risk factor for apathy 
conversion. Apathy syndrome is an early manifestation of cognitive decline and 
there are bidirectional roles between apathy syndrome and Aβ pathology. 
Prefrontal Aβ pathology influenced the pathway from apathy to cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Growing interest in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in 
the earliest stages requires new clinical endpoints. Currently, there is no 
established clinical endpoint or treatment duration for mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) trials.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis attempts to answer "how long the MCI clinical trial 
would be necessary" using the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) as 
a clinical endpoint, where CDR-SB is an example of a suitable tool to assess 
both cognition and function as a single primary efficacy outcome.
METHODS: A longitudinal model was developed to predict the CDR-SB time-profile. 
The CDR-SB is considered ideal to assess both cognition and function as a single 
primary endpoint in MCI trials. The median time for clinically "worsening", 
defined using several thresholds for change from baseline, was calculated using 
individual CDR-SB predictions. Covariates predictive of worsening were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The median time to a 1-point change in CDR-SB was approximately 2 years 
in MCI patients. Higher baseline severity in disease, lower hippocampal volume, 
and ApoE4 carrier status were significant covariates predicting shorter times to 
worsening (faster progress). The results indicate that at least a 2-year trial 
would be necessary with 30% (or more) disease modifying drug with a sample size 
of n = 350 to detect the significant difference from placebo (80% power) and to 
achieve the target mean effect size of 0.5 point change in CDR-SB.
CONCLUSION: Predictions of CDR-SB changes from a longitudinal model are able to 
inform study design and possible enrichment strategies, based on covariate 
analyses, for prospective planning of clinical trials in MCI patients.

Late-life depression, even when of subsyndromal severity, has shown strong 
associations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Preclinical studies have suggested that serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) can attenuate amyloidogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the 
effect of SSRI medication on amyloidosis and grey matter volume in subsyndromal 
depressed subjects with MCI and AD during an interval of two years. 256 
cognitively affected subjects (225 MCI/ 31 AD) undergoing [18F]-AV45-PET and MRI 
at baseline and 2-year follow-up were selected from the ADNI database. Subjects 
with a positive depression item (DEP(+); n = 73) in the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory Questionnaire were subdivided to those receiving SSRI medication 
(SSRI(+); n = 24) and those without SSRI treatment (SSRI(-); n = 49). 
Longitudinal cognition (Δ-ADAS), amyloid deposition rate (standardized uptake 
value, using white matter as reference region (SUVRWM), and changes in grey 
matter volume were compared using common covariates. Analyses were performed 
separately in all subjects and in the subgroup of amyloid-positive subjects. 
Cognitive performance in DEP(+)/SSRI(+) subjects (Δ-ADAS: -5.0%) showed less 
deterioration with 2-year follow-up when compared to DEP(+)/SSRI(-) subjects 
(Δ-ADAS: +18.6%, p < 0.05), independent of amyloid SUVRWM at baseline. With SSRI 
treatment, the progression of grey matter atrophy was reduced (-0.9% versus 
-2.7%, p < 0.05), notably in fronto-temporal cortex. A slight trend towards 
lower amyloid deposition rate was observed in DEP(+)/SSRI(+) subjects versus 
DEP(+)/SSRI(-). Despite the lack of effect to amyloid PET, SSRI medication 
distinctly rescued the declining cognitive performance in cognitively affected 
patients with depressive symptoms, and likewise attenuated grey matter atrophy.

Recently, a large meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies (GWAS) 
identified a novel locus (rs2718058) adjacent to NME8 that played a preventive 
role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this link between the single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058 and the pathology of AD have not been 
mentioned yet. Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association 
between the NME8 rs2718058 genotypes and AD-related measures including the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, tau, P-tau concentrations, neuroimaging 
biomarkers and cognitive performance, in a large cohort from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used information of a total of 719 
individuals, including 211 normal cognition (NC), 346 mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and 162 AD. Although we didn't observe a positive relationship between 
rs2718058 and AD, it was significantly associated with several AD related 
endophenotypes. Among the normal cognitively normal participants, the minor 
allele G carriers showed significantly associated with higher CDRSB score than A 
allele carriers (P = 0.021). Occipital gyrus atrophy were significantly 
associated with NME8 genotype status (P = 0.002), with A allele carriers has 
more atrophy than the minor allele G carriers in AD patients; lateral ventricle 
(both right and left) cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) were 
significantly associated with NME8 genotype (P < 0.05), with GA genotype had 
higher metabolism than GG and AA genotypes in MCI group; the atrophic right 
hippocampus in 18 months is significantly different between the three group, 
with GG and AA genotypes had more hippocampus atrophy than GA genotypes in the 
whole group. Together, our results are consistent with the direction of previous 
research, suggesting that NME8 rs2718058 appears to play a role in lowering the 
brain neurodegeneration.

Improved prediction of progression to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) among older 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of high clinical and 
societal importance. We recently developed a polygenic hazard score (PHS) that 
predicted age of AD onset above and beyond APOE. Here, we used data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to further explore the 
potential clinical utility of PHS for predicting AD development in older adults 
with MCI. We examined the predictive value of PHS alone and in combination with 
baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data on performance on the 
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). In survival analyses, PHS significantly predicted 
time to progression from MCI to AD over 120 months (p = 1.07e-5), and PHS was 
significantly more predictive than APOE alone (p = 0.015). Combining PHS with 
baseline brain atrophy score and/or MMSE score significantly improved prediction 
compared to models without PHS (three-factor model p = 4.28e-17). Prediction 
model accuracies, sensitivities and area under the curve were also improved by 
including PHS in the model, compared to only using atrophy score and MMSE. 
Further, using linear mixed-effect modeling, PHS improved the prediction of 
change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score and MMSE over 
36 months in patients with MCI at baseline, beyond both APOE and baseline levels 
of brain atrophy. These results illustrate the potential clinical utility of PHS 
for assessment of risk for AD progression among individuals with MCI both alone, 
or in conjunction with clinical measures of prodromal disease including measures 
of cognitive function and regional brain atrophy.

We examined differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by Arterial Spin 
Labeled perfusion MRI (ASL MRI) across the continuum from cognitively normal 
(CN) older adults to mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using data from the 
multi-site Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Measures of CBF, 
in a predetermined set of regions (meta-ROI), and hippocampal volume were 
compared between CN (n = 47), patients with early and late Mild Cognitive 
Impairment [EMCI (n = 32), LMCI (n = 35)], and AD (n = 15). Associations between 
these measures and disease severity, assessed by Clinical Dementia Rating scale 
sum of boxes (CDR SB), were also assessed. Mean meta-ROI CBF was associated with 
group status and significant hypoperfusion was observed in LMCI and AD relative 
to CN. Hippocampal volume was associated with group status, but only AD patients 
had significantly smaller volumes than the CN. When examining the relationship 
between these measures and disease severity, both were significantly associated 
with CDR SB and appeared to provide independent prediction of status. In light 
of the tight link between CBF and metabolism, ASL MRI represents a promising 
functional biomarker for early diagnosis and disease tracking in AD and this 
study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility in a multi-site context in 
this population. Combining functional and structural measures, which can be 
acquired in the same scanning session, appears to provide additional information

BACKGROUND: We investigated the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) reversion to cognitively normal 
(CN).
METHODS: Of a total of 1,233 participants from the ADNI database, 42 
participants with MCI reversion to CN (MCIr), 778 with MCI, and 413 CN were 
obtained. We evaluated demographics, clinical outcomes, medication use, MCI 
type, and AD biomarkers, including genetic, cerebrospinal fluid, imaging, and 
neuropsychological data.
RESULTS: This study showed that the differences between MCIr and CN were only 
age, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes, 
but the differences between MCIr and MCI were not only clinical outcomes but 
also AD biomarkers, including genetic, cerebrospinal fluid, imaging, and 
neuropsychological data. Overall, MCIr may be similar to CN and not MCI in 
clinical characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: With assessment of MCI reversion to CN, the possibility of 
false-positive errors should be considered. With the assistance of AD 
biomarkers, MCI can be evaluated more accurately than the conventional criteria.

We sought to develop and evaluate a composite memory score from the 
neuropsychological battery used in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI). We used modern psychometric approaches to analyze 
longitudinal Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, 2 versions), AD 
Assessment Schedule - Cognition (ADAS-Cog, 3 versions), Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), and Logical Memory data to develop ADNI-Mem, a composite 
memory score. We compared RAVLT and ADAS-Cog versions, and compared ADNI-Mem to 
RAVLT recall sum scores, four ADAS-Cog-derived scores, the MMSE, and the 
Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. We evaluated rates of decline in normal 
cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, ability to predict 
conversion from MCI to AD, strength of association with selected imaging 
parameters, and ability to differentiate rates of decline between participants 
with and without AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signatures. The second version of 
the RAVLT was harder than the first. The ADAS-Cog versions were of similar 
difficulty. ADNI-Mem was slightly better at detecting change than total RAVLT 
recall scores. It was as good as or better than all of the other scores at 
predicting conversion from MCI to AD. It was associated with all our selected 
imaging parameters for people with MCI and AD. Participants with MCI with an AD 
CSF signature had somewhat more rapid decline than did those without. This paper 
illustrates appropriate methods for addressing the different versions of word 
lists, and demonstrates the additional power to be gleaned with a 
psychometrically sound composite memory score.

Recent GWAS studies focused on uncovering novel genetic loci related to AD have 
revealed associations with variants near CLU, CR1, PICALM and BIN1. In this 
study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in an independent set of 
1034 cases and 1186 controls using the Illumina genotyping platforms. By 
coupling our data with available GWAS datasets from the ADNI and GenADA, we 
replicated the original associations in both PICALM (rs3851179) and CR1 
(rs3818361). The PICALM variant seems to be non-significant after we adjusted 
for APOE e4 status. We further tested our top markers in 751 independent cases 
and 751 matched controls. Besides the markers close to the APOE locus, a marker 
(rs12989701) upstream of BIN1 locus was replicated and the combined analysis 
reached genome-wide significance level (p = 5E-08). We combined our data with 
the published Harold et al. study and meta-analysis with all available 6521 
cases and 10360 controls at the BIN1 locus revealed two significant variants 
(rs12989701, p = 1.32E-10 and rs744373, p = 3.16E-10) in limited linkage 
disequilibrium (r²  =  0.05) with each other. The independent contribution of 
both SNPs was supported by haplotype conditional analysis. We also conducted 
multivariate analysis in canonical pathways and identified a consistent signal 
in the downstream pathways targeted by Gleevec (P = 0.004 in Pfizer; P = 0.028 
in ADNI and P = 0.04 in GenADA). We further tested variants in CLU, PICALM, BIN1 
and CR1 for association with disease progression in 597 AD patients where 
longitudinal cognitive measures are sufficient. Both the PICALM and CLU variants 
showed nominal significant association with cognitive decline as measured by 
change in Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score from the baseline 
but did not pass multiple-test correction. Future experiments will help us 
better understand potential roles of these genetic loci in AD pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Over the last few decades, numerous late-phase multi-regional 
clinical trials have been conducted to develop a novel treatment for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), with no effective results.
OBJECTIVE: To inform the design and interpretation of future clinical trials, 
the aim of this study was first to examine the current landscape of late-phase 
clinical trials to determine key study design characteristics, and then assess 
the regional variation between Japan and North America for the most utilized 
clinical efficacy endpoint in the most targeted stage of the disease.
METHODS: The study design and the mechanism of action of the interventional 
drugs tested in the late-phase clinical trials initiated in the last 5 years 
(2014-2018) were assessed based on the records in ClinicalTrials.gov database. 
The regional variation of the most utilized clinical efficacy endpoint in the 
most targeted population was assessed using data from two similarly designed 
observational studies conducted in Japan (Japanese Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative, J-ADNI) and North America (Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI). For the most utilized clinical efficacy 
endpoint, the change from baseline (CFB) at Month 6, Year 1 and Year 2 was 
estimated using the growth curve model with a random intercept and slope, 
including gender as a fixed factor and age, apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype and 
years of education as covariates.
RESULTS: Of 48 Phase III trials that were initiated during the study period, 25 
were disease-modifying treatment trials in which individuals with early AD were 
the most studied (56%) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was 
the most frequently utilized primary clinical efficacy endpoint (64%). The 
baseline characteristics of the early AD population between J-ADNI and ADNI were 
generally comparable, except for years of education. When comparing CDR-SB in 
early AD, J-ADNI had generally better baseline scores and the overall 
progression was similar (CFB at Year 2, ADNI 2.7 and J-ADNI 2.3, p = 0.190), 
despite slower progression in functional domains (CFB at Year 2, ADNI 1.4 and 
J-ADNI 1.0, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: Over the years, the target population has shifted toward early stage 
of the disease, wherein the clinical progression is slower and difficult to 
measure. Moreover, our results suggest that regional variation could have an 
impact on functional measurements due to cultural differences in pivotal 
clinical trials. Therefore, caution should be exercised according to the 
characteristics of the endpoint used.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ42) 
accompanied by brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Several recent studies have 
shown that Aβ42 accumulation is associated with gray matter (GM) changes prior 
to the development of cognitive impairment, in the so-called preclinical stage 
of the AD (pre-AD). It also has been proved that the GM atrophy profile is not 
linear, both in normal ageing but, especially, on AD. However, several other 
factors may influence this association and may have an impact on the 
generalization of results from different samples. In this work, we estimate 
differences in rates of GM volume change in cognitively healthy elders in 
association with baseline core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and 
assess to what these differences are sample dependent. We report the dependence 
of atrophy rates, measured in a two-year interval, on Aβ42, computed both over 
continuous and categorical values of Aβ42, at voxel-level (p < 0.001; k < 100) 
and corrected for sex, age and education. Analyses were performed jointly and 
separately, on two samples. The first sample was formed of 31 individuals (22 
Ctrl and 9 pre-AD), aged 60-80 and recruited at the Hospital Clinic of 
Barcelona. The second sample was a replica of the first one with subjects 
selected from the ADNI dataset. We also investigated the dependence of the GM 
atrophy rate on the basal levels of continuous p-tau and on the p-tau/Aβ42 
ratio. Correlation analyses on the whole sample showed a dependence of GM 
atrophy rates on Aβ42 in medial and orbital frontal, precuneus, cingulate, 
medial temporal regions and cerebellum. Correlations with p-tau were located in 
the left hippocampus, parahippocampus and striatal nuclei whereas correlation 
with p-tau/Aβ42 was mainly found in ventral and medial temporal areas. Regarding 
analyses performed separately, we found a substantial discrepancy of results 
between samples, illustrating the complexities of comparing two independent 
datasets even when using the same inclusion criteria. Such discrepancies may 
lead to significant differences in the sample size needed to detect a particular 
reduction on cerebral atrophy rates in prevention trials. Higher cognitive 
reserve and more advanced pathological progression in the ADNI sample could 
partially account for the observed discrepancies. Taken together, our findings 
in these two samples highlight the importance of comparing and merging 
independent datasets to draw more robust and generalizable conclusions on the 
structural changes in the preclinical stages of AD.

Research on serotonin reveals a lack of consensus regarding its role in brain 
volume, especially concerning biomarkers linked to neurogenesis and 
neuroplasticity, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), fibroblast growth 
factor 4 (FGF-4), bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6), and matrix 
metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to 
investigate the influence of serotonin on brain structure and hippocampal 
volumes in relation to cognitive functions in AD, as well as its link with 
biomarkers like CNTF, FGF-4, BMP-6, and MMP-1. Data from 133 ADNI participants 
with AD included cognitive assessments (CDR-SB), serotonin measurements 
(Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit, UPLC-MS/MS), and neurotrophic factors 
quantified via multiplex proteomics. Gray matter volume changes were analyzed 
using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) with MRI. Statistical analyses employed 
Pearson correlation, bootstrap methods, and FDR-adjusted p-values (< 0.05 
or < 0.01) via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, alongside nonparametric 
methods. The analysis found a positive correlation between serotonin levels and 
total brain (r = 0.229, p = 0.023) and hippocampal volumes (right: r = 0.186, 
p = 0.032; left: r = 0.210, p = 0.023), even after FDR adjustment. Higher 
serotonin levels were linked to better cognitive function (negative correlation 
with CDR-SB, r = -0.230, p = 0.024). Notably, serotonin levels were positively 
correlated with BMP-6 (r = 0.173, p = 0.047), CNTF (r = 0.216, p = 0.013), FGF-4 
(r = 0.176, p = 0.043), and MMP-1 (r = 0.202, p = 0.019), suggesting a link 
between serotonin and neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. However, after adjusting 
for multiple comparisons and controlling for confounding factors such as age, 
gender, education, and APOE genotypes (APOE3 and APOE4), none of the 
correlations of biomarkers remained statistically significant. In conclusion, 
increased serotonin levels are associated with improved cognitive function and 
increased brain volume. However, associations with CNTF, FGF-4, BMP-6, and MMP-1 
were not statistically significant after adjustments, highlighting the 
complexity of serotonin's role in AD and the need for further research.

Sleep and related disorders could lead to changes in various brain networks, but 
little is known about the role of amyloid β (Aβ) burden-a key Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) biomarker-in the relationship between sleep disturbance and altered 
resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in older adults. This 
cross-sectional study examined the association between sleep disturbance, Aβ 
burden, and rsFC using a large-scale dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Sample included 489 individuals (53.6% 
cognitively normal, 32.5% mild cognitive impairment, and 13.9% AD) who had 
completed sleep measures (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), PET Aβ data, and 
resting-state fMRI scans at baseline. Within and between rsFC of the Salience 
(SN), the Default Mode (DMN) and the Frontal Parietal network (FPN) were 
compared between participants with sleep disturbance versus without sleep 
disturbance. The interaction between Aβ positivity and sleep disturbance was 
evaluated using linear regressions, controlling for age, diagnosis status, 
gender, sedatives and hypnotics use, and hypertension. Although no significant 
main effect of sleep disturbance was found on rsFC, a significant interaction 
term emerged between sleep disturbance and Aβ burden on rsFC of SN (β=0.11, 
P=0.006). Specifically, sleep disturbance was associated with SN 
hyperconnectivity, only with the presence of Aβ burden. Sleep disturbance may 
lead to altered connectivity in the SN when Aβ is accumulated in the brain. 
Individuals with AD pathology may be at increased risk for sleep-related 
aberrant rsFC; therefore, identifying and treating sleep problems in these 
individuals may help prevent further disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects ∼25% of Veterans, a 
prevalence rate double that of the general population. T2DM is associated with 
greater dementia risk and has been shown to exacerbate the impact of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) risk factors on declines in daily functioning; however, there are 
few studies that investigate these patterns in older Veterans.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether T2DM moderates the association 
between amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1-year change in 
everyday functioning in older Veterans.
METHODS: One-hundred-ninety-eight predominately male Vietnam-Era Veterans 
without dementia from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (DoD-ADNI) with (n = 74) and without (n = 124) T2DM completed Aβ PET 
imaging and everyday functioning measures, including the Clinical Dementia 
Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Everyday Cognition (ECog). Linear mixed effects 
models tested the moderating role of T2DM on the association between Aβ PET and 
1-year change in everyday functioning.
RESULTS: The 3-way T2DM×Aβ PET×time interaction was significant for CDR-SB 
(p < 0.001) as well as the Memory (p = 0.007) and Language (p = 0.011) subscales 
from the ECog. Greater amyloid burden was associated with greater increases in 
functional difficulties, but only in Veterans with T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher Aβ was only associated with declines in everyday functioning 
over 1 year in Veterans with T2DM. Given that people with T2DM are more likely 
to have co-occurring cerebrovascular disease, the combination of multiple 
neuropathologies may result in faster declines. Future studies should examine 
how diabetes duration, severity, and medications impact these associations.

IMPORTANCE: A reliable method of detecting Alzheimer disease (AD) in its 
prodromal state is needed for patient stratification in clinical trials or for 
personalizing existing or potential upcoming therapies. Current cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF)- or imaging-based single biomarkers for AD offer reliable 
identification of patients with underlying AD but insufficient prediction of the 
rate of AD progression.
OBJECTIVE: To optimize prediction of progression from mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to AD dementia by combining information from diverse patient variables.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study from the Alzheimer Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) enrolled 928 patients with MCI at baseline and 
249 selected variables available in the ADNI data set. Variables included 
clinical and demographic data, cognitive scores, magnetic resonance 
imaging-based brain volumetric data, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase 
of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) genotypes, and analyte 
levels measured in the CSF and plasma. Data were collected in July 2012 and 
analyzed from July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Progression from MCI to AD within 1 to 6 years. To 
determine whether combinations of markers could predict progression from MCI to 
AD within 1 to 6 years, the elastic net algorithm was used in an iterative 
resampling of a training- and test-based variable selection and modeling 
approach.
RESULTS: Among the 928 patients with MCI in the ADNI database, 94 had 224 of the 
required variables available for the modeling. The results showed the 
contributions of age, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes composite test 
score, hippocampal volume, and multiple plasma and CSF factors in modeling 
progression to AD. A combination of apolipoprotein A-II and cortisol levels in 
plasma and fibroblast growth factor 4, heart-type fatty acid binding protein, 
calcitonin, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 
3 (TRAIL-R3) in CSF allowed for reliable prediction of disease status 3 years 
from the time of sample collection (80% classification accuracy, 88% 
sensitivity, and 70% specificity).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These study findings suggest that a combination of 
markers measured in plasma and CSF, distinct from β-amyloid and tau, could prove 
useful in predicting midterm progression from MCI to AD dementia. Such a 
large-scale, multivariable-based analytical approach could be applied to other 
similar large data sets involving AD and beyond.

INTRODUCTION: Selecting individuals at high risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia and using the most sensitive outcome measures are important aspects of 
trial design.
METHODS: We divided participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative at the 50th percentile of the predicted absolute risk of the 
polygenic hazard score (PHS). Outcome measures were the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Schedule-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), ADNI-Mem, Clinical Dementia 
Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR SB), and Cognitive Function Composite 2 (CFC2). In 
addition to modeling, we use a power analysis compare numbers needed with each 
technique.
RESULTS: Data from 188 cognitively normal and 319 mild cognitively impaired 
(MCI) participants were analyzed. Using the ADAS-Cog to estimate sample sizes, 
without stratification over 24 months, would require 930 participants with MCI, 
while using the CFC2 and restricting participants to those in the upper 50th 
percentile would require only 284 participants.
DISCUSSION: Combining stratification by PHS and selection of a sensitive 
combined outcome measure in a cohort of patients with MCI can allow trial design 
that is more efficient, potentially less burdensome on participants, and more 
cost effective.

Accurate, automated white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentations are needed 
for large-scale studies to understand contributions of WMH to neurological 
diseases. We evaluated Bayesian Model Selection (BaMoS), a hierarchical 
fully-unsupervised model selection framework for WMH segmentation. We compared 
BaMoS segmentations to semi-automated segmentations, and assessed whether they 
predicted longitudinal cognitive change in control, early Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (EMCI), late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), subjective/significant 
memory concern (SMC) and Alzheimer's (AD) participants. Data were downloaded 
from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Magnetic resonance 
images from 30 control and 30 AD participants were selected to incorporate 
multiple scanners, and were semi-automatically segmented by 4 raters and BaMoS. 
Segmentations were assessed using volume correlation, Dice score, and other 
spatial metrics. Linear mixed-effect models were fitted to 180 control, 107 SMC, 
320 EMCI, 171 LMCI and 151 AD participants separately in each group, with the 
outcomes being cognitive change (e.g. mini-mental state examination; MMSE), and 
BaMoS WMH, age, sex, race and education used as predictors. There was a high 
level of agreement between BaMoS' WMH segmentation volumes and a consensus of 
rater segmentations, with a median Dice score of 0.74 and correlation 
coefficient of 0.96. BaMoS WMH predicted cognitive change in: control, EMCI, and 
SMC groups using MMSE; LMCI using clinical dementia rating scale; and EMCI using 
Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (p < 0.05, all tests). 
BaMoS compares well to semi-automated segmentation, is robust to different WMH 
loads and scanners, and can generate volumes which predict decline. BaMoS can be 
applicable to further large-scale studies.

The purpose of this study was to use serial imaging to gain insight into the 
sequence of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease, and the clinical features 
associated with this sequence. We measured change in amyloid deposition over 
time using serial (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography 
and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance 
imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn 
from two sources--ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the 
Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). All subjects underwent 
clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies at two time points, approximately one 
year apart. PIB retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio 
units and brain atrophy in units of cm(3) by measuring ventricular expansion. 
The annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical group (P = 
0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater 
than zero among all subjects (P < 0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed 
by clinical group (P < 0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively 
normal (1.3 cm(3)/year) < amnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm(3)/year) < 
Alzheimer's disease (7.7 cm(3)/year). Among all subjects there was no 
correlation between PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = -0.01, P = 
0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE (r =-0.22, P = 0.09). In 
contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with 
worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = 0.42, P < 0.01) and MMSE (r =-0.52, P 
< 0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's 
disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid 
deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid 
deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration 
accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not 
amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical 
decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce 
cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's 
disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate 
of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. 
Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive 
decline. This model implies a complimentary role for MRI and PIB imaging in 
Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid 
dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Discrepancy-based Evidence for Loss of 
Thinking Abilities (DELTA) score. The DELTA score characterizes the strength of 
evidence for cognitive decline on a continuous spectrum using well-established 
psychometric principles for improving detection of cognitive changes.
METHODS: DELTA score development used neuropsychological test scores from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (two tests each from 
Memory, Executive Function, and Language domains). We derived regression-based 
normative reference scores using age, gender, years of education, and 
word-reading ability from robust cognitively normal ADNI participants. 
Discrepancies between predicted and observed scores were used for calculating 
the DELTA score (range 0-15). We validated DELTA scores primarily against 
longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) and Functional 
Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) scores (baseline assessment through Year 3) using 
linear mixed models and secondarily against cross-sectional Alzheimer's 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: There were 1359 ADNI participants with calculable baseline DELTA scores 
(age 73.7 ± 7.1 years, 55.4% female, 100% white/Caucasian). Higher baseline 
DELTA scores (stronger evidence of cognitive decline) predicted higher baseline 
CDR-SOB (ΔR2 = .318) and faster rates of CDR-SOB increase over time (ΔR2 = 
.209). Longitudinal changes in DELTA scores tracked closely and in the same 
direction as CDR-SOB scores (fixed and random effects of mean + mean-centered 
DELTA, ΔR2 > .7). Results were similar for FAQ scores. High DELTA scores 
predicted higher PET-Aβ SUVr (ρ = 324), higher CSF-pTau/CSF-Aβ ratio (ρ = .460), 
and demonstrated PPV > .9 for positive Alzheimer's disease biomarker 
classification.
CONCLUSIONS: Data support initial development and validation of the DELTA score 
through its associations with longitudinal functional changes and Alzheimer's 
biomarkers. We provide several considerations for future research and include an 
automated scoring program for clinical use.

INTRODUCTION: We examined reasons for low mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI)-to-cognitively normal (CN) reversion rates in the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
METHODS: CN and MCI participants were identified as remaining stable, 
progressing, or reverting at 1-year of follow-up (Year 1). Application of ADNI's 
MCI criteria at Year 1 in addition to Alzheimer's disease biomarkers by group 
were examined.
RESULTS: The MCI-to-CN reversion rate was 3.0%. When specific components were 
examined, 22.5% of stable MCI participants had normal memory performance at Year 
1 and their Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were consistent with the stable CN 
group. At Year 1, when all MCI criteria were not met, the more subjective 
Clinical Dementia Rating rather than objective memory measure appeared to drive 
continuation of the MCI diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Results demonstrate an artificially low 1-year MCI-to-CN reversion 
rate in ADNI-diagnosed participants. If the Logical Memory cutoffs had been 
consistently applied, the reversion rate would have been at least 21.8%.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical characteristics and course of patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer disease (AD) treated with 
cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine hydrochloride.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: The 59 recruiting sites for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI).
PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients with MCI and AD in ADNI.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and 
Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).
RESULTS: A total of 177 (44.0%) of 402 MCI patients and 159 (84.6%) of 188 
mild-AD patients were treated with ChEIs and 11.4% of MCI patients and 45.7% of 
AD patients with memantine at entry. Mild-cognitive-impairment patients who 
received ChEIs with or without memantine were more impaired, showed greater 
decline in scores, and progressed to dementia sooner than patients who did not 
receive ChEIs. Alzheimer-disease patients who received ChEIs and memantine took 
them longer, were more functionally impaired, and showed greater decline on the 
MMSE and CDR (but not on the ADAS-cog or FAQ) than those who received ChEIs 
only.
CONCLUSIONS: Academic physicians frequently prescribe ChEIs and memantine 
earlier than indicated in the US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling 
to patients who are relatively more severely impaired or who are rapidly 
progressing toward cognitive impairment. The use of these medications in ADNI is 
associated with clinical decline and may affect the interpretation of clinical 
trial outcomes.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are among the most disabling 
and difficult aspects for caregivers and treating health professionals to 
manage. Despite the high prevalence of these behaviors, little is known about 
the factors which lead some patients to develop florid behavioral symptoms while 
others may progress to severe dementia without such phenomenon. We examined 
whether regional brain volumes as measured by cortical thickness would predict 
the presence or absence of disinhibition in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
Using data from the ADNI, we identified 758 patients with caregiver ratings on 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and a volumetric MRI scan with cortical thickness 
measurements completed in FreeSurfer by the UCSF core. Of these, 177 patients 
were found to have disinhibition. Logistic regression models demonstrated that 
reduced cortical thickness in the right frontal pole was associated with the 
presence of disinhibition even when controlling for age, disease severity, total 
intracranial volume, gender, and APOE genotype. The results are considered in 
the context of leading models of the functions of frontopolar cortex.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage from normal 
aging to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corresponds to a higher risk of developing 
AD. Thus, it is necessary to explore and predict the onset of AD in MCI stage. 
In this study, we propose a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) 
and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to investigate 
promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion among 126 MCI converters 
and 108 MCI non-converters from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, we extracted 
brain networks from AD and normal control groups via ICA and then constructed 
Cox models that included network-based neuroimaging factors for the MCI group. 
We carried out five separate Cox analyses and the two-modality neuroimaging Cox 
model identified three significant network-based risk factors with higher 
prediction performance (accuracy = 73.50%) than those in either single-modality 
model (accuracy = 68.80%). Additionally, the results of the comprehensive Cox 
model, including significant neuroimaging factors and clinical variables, 
demonstrated that MCI individuals with reduced gray matter volume in a temporal 
lobe-related network of structural MRI [hazard ratio (HR) = 8.29E-05 (95% 
confidence interval (CI), 5.10E- 07 ~ 0.013)], low glucose metabolism in the 
posterior default mode network based on FDG-PET [HR = 0.066 (95% CI, 4.63E-03 ~ 
0.928)], positive apolipoprotein E ε4-status [HR = 1. 988 (95% CI, 1.531 ~ 
2.581)], increased Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 
scores [HR = 1.100 (95% CI, 1.059 ~ 1.144)] and Sum of Boxes of Clinical 
Dementia Rating scores [HR = 1.622 (95% CI, 1.364 ~ 1.930)] were more likely to 
convert to AD within 36 months after baselines. These significant risk factors 
in such comprehensive Cox model had the best prediction ability (accuracy = 
84.62%, sensitivity = 86.51%, specificity = 82.41%) compared to either 
neuroimaging factors or clinical variables alone. These results suggested that a 
combination of ICA and Cox model analyses could be used successfully in survival 
analysis and provide a network-based perspective of MCI progression or 
AD-related studies.

BACKGROUND: TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor that is predominantly expressed by 
microglia in the central nervous system. Rare variants in the TREM2 gene 
increase the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble TREM2 
(sTREM2) resulting from shedding of the TREM2 ectodomain can be detected in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is a surrogate measure of TREM2-mediated microglia 
function. CSF sTREM2 has been previously reported to increase at different 
clinical stages of AD, however, alterations in relation to Amyloid β-peptide 
(Aβ) deposition or additional pathological processes in the amyloid cascade 
(such as tau pathology or neurodegeneration) remain unclear. In the current 
cross-sectional study, we employed the biomarker-based classification framework 
recently proposed by the NIA-AA consensus guidelines, in combination with 
clinical staging, in order to examine the CSF sTREM2 alterations at early 
asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of AD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1027 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Imaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 43 subjects carrying TREM2 rare 
genetic variants, was conducted to measure CSF sTREM2 using a previously 
validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ADNI participants were 
classified following the A/T/N framework, which we implemented based on the CSF 
levels of Aβ1-42 (A), phosphorylated tau (T) and total tau as a marker of 
neurodegeneration (N), at different clinical stages defined by the clinical 
dementia rating (CDR) score.
RESULTS: CSF sTREM2 differed between TREM2 variants, whereas the p.R47H variant 
had higher CSF sTREM2, p.L211P had lower CSF sTREM2 than non-carriers. We found 
that CSF sTREM2 increased in early symptomatic stages of late-onset AD but, 
unexpectedly, we observed decreased CSF sTREM2 levels at the earliest 
asymptomatic phase when only abnormal Aβ pathology (A+) but no tau pathology or 
neurodegeneration (TN-), is present.
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ pathology (A) and tau pathology/neurodegeneration (TN) have 
differing associations with CSF sTREM2. While tau-related neurodegeneration is 
associated with an increase in CSF sTREM2, Aβ pathology in the absence of 
downstream tau-related neurodegeneration is associated with a decrease in CSF 
sTREM2.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that anxiety in amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI) increases rates of conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 
identify potential neural mechanisms underlying such an association.
METHODS: Participants (N = 376) with aMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were studied over a median period of 36 months. A 
Cox proportional-hazards model was used to assess the association between 
anxiety severity ratings on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and AD 
risk. Other variables were depression, memory loss, and MRI-derived AD-related 
regions of interest (ROIs), including hippocampal, amygdalar, entorhinal 
cortical (EC) volumes, and EC thickness, In addition, a linear regression model 
was used to determine the effect of anxiety in aMCI on rates of atrophy within 
ROIs.
RESULTS: Anxiety severity increased rate of aMCI conversion to AD, after 
controlling for depression and cognitive decline. The association between 
anxiety and AD remained significant even with inclusion of ROI baseline values 
or atrophy rates as explanatory variables. Further, anxiety status predicted 
greater rates of decrease in EC volume. An association between anxiety and EC 
thickness missed significance.
CONCLUSION: Anxiety symptoms in aMCI predict conversion to AD, over and beyond 
the effects of depression, memory loss, or atrophy within AD neuroimaging 
biomarkers. These findings, together with the greater EC atrophy rate predicted 
by anxiety, are compatible with the hypothesis that anxiety is not a prodromal 
noncognitive feature of AD but may accelerate decline toward AD through direct 
or indirect effects on EC.

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether plasma transferrin 
levels are associated with longitudinal changes in cognitive performance in 
older individuals with normal cognition (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: At baseline, there were a total of 
358 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
cohort, including 58 older individuals with CN, 198 older individuals with MCI, 
and 102 patients with AD. Linear mixed models were utilized to examine the 
associations of plasma transferrin levels with changes in cognitive performance 
over time after adjustment of several potential covariates. The Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes 
(CDR-SB) were used to examine the global cognition of participants. Results: 
First, no significant differences in the plasma transferrin levels were observed 
across three diagnostic groups. Second, in the cross-sectional analyses, the 
baseline plasma transferrin levels were negatively associated with the MMSE 
scores in the CN group, but not in the MCI or the AD group. Third, in the 
longitudinal analyses, we found that a higher plasma transferrin was associated 
with a steeper cognitive decline in the MCI and AD groups, but not in the CN 
group. Conclusion: Higher plasma transferrin levels were associated with a 
steeper cognitive decline in participants with MCI and AD.

BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene encoding 
the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1, rs1868402) and the 
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883) gene were recently 
associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels in samples from the 
Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (WU) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In these same samples, these 
SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of 
boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an 
independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County 
Dementia Progression Study (DPS).
METHODS: All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb ≤1 (mild) at initial 
clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other 
time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and 
rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these 
SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS.
RESULTS: Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 
alone and change in CDR-sb (P > .10), there was a significant association 
between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the 
high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed >2.9 times faster than noncarriers 
(P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from 
WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk 
allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both 
loci progressed 6 times faster (P < .0001) than all others combined.
CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific 
variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated 
progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a 
better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of 
AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic 
strategies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different biomarkers for AD may potentially be 
complementary in diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Our aim was to combine MR 
imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers in the diagnostic classification and 2-year 
prognosis of MCI and AD, by examining the following: 1) which measures are most 
sensitive to diagnostic status, 2) to what extent the methods provide unique 
information in diagnostic classification, and 3) which measures are most 
predictive of clinical decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADNI baseline MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 42 
controls, 73 patients with MCI, and 38 patients with AD; and 2-year clinical 
follow-up data for 36 controls, 51 patients with MCI, and 25 patients with AD 
were analyzed. The hippocampus and entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial, 
precuneus, inferior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, lateral, and 
medial orbitofrontal cortices were used as regions of interest. CSF variables 
included Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/Abeta42 and p-tau/Abeta42. 
Regression analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of measures to 
diagnostic status as well as 2-year change in CDR-SB, MMSE, and delayed logical 
memory in MCI.
RESULTS: Hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/Abeta42 uniquely 
predicted diagnostic group. Change in CDR-SB was best predicted by retrosplenial 
thickness; MMSE, by retrosplenial metabolism and thickness; and delayed logical 
memory, by hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: All biomarkers were sensitive to the diagnostic group. Combining MR 
imaging morphometry and CSF biomarkers improved diagnostic classification 
(controls versus AD). MR imaging morphometry and PET were largely overlapping in 
value for discrimination. Baseline MR imaging and PET measures were more 
predictive of clinical change in MCI than were CSF measures.

Effectiveness of regional DTI measures in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease, 
MCI, and normal aging.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) recently added diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI), among several other new imaging modalities, in an effort 
to identify sensitive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While anatomical 
MRI is the main structural neuroimaging method used in most AD studies and 
clinical trials, DTI is sensitive to microscopic white matter (WM) changes not 
detectable with standard MRI, offering additional markers of neurodegeneration. 
Prior DTI studies of AD report lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and increased 
mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AxD, RD) throughout WM. Here we 
assessed which DTI measures may best identify differences among AD, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively healthy elderly control (NC) groups, 
in region of interest (ROI) and voxel-based analyses of 155 ADNI participants 
(mean age: 73.5 ± 7.4; 90 M/65 F; 44 NC, 88 MCI, 23 AD). Both VBA and ROI 
analyses revealed widespread group differences in FA and all diffusivity 
measures. DTI maps were strongly correlated with widely-used clinical ratings 
(MMSE, CDR-sob, and ADAS-cog). When effect sizes were ranked, FA analyses were 
least sensitive for picking up group differences. Diffusivity measures could 
detect more subtle MCI differences, where FA could not. ROIs showing strongest 
group differentiation (lowest p-values) included tracts that pass through the 
temporal lobe, and posterior brain regions. The left hippocampal component of 
the cingulum showed consistently high effect sizes for distinguishing groups, 
across all diffusivity and anisotropy measures, and in correlations with 
cognitive scores.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of computational 
algorithm, measurement variability, and cut point on hippocampal volume 
(HCV)-based patient selection for clinical trials in mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). We used normal control and amnestic MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) as normative reference and screening 
cohorts. We evaluated the enrichment performance of 4 widely used hippocampal 
segmentation algorithms (FreeSurfer, Hippocampus Multi-Atlas Propagation and 
Segmentation (HMAPS), Learning Embeddings Atlas Propagation (LEAP), and 
NeuroQuant) in terms of 2-year changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We modeled the implications for sample 
size, screen fail rates, and trial cost and duration. HCV based patient 
selection yielded reduced sample sizes (by ∼40%-60%) and lower trial costs (by 
∼30%-40%) across a wide range of cut points. These results provide a guide to 
the choice of HCV cut point for amnestic MCI clinical trials, allowing an 
informed tradeoff between statistical and practical considerations.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) on 
ratings of disability for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Data from 405 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were analyzed. Participants were evaluated 
at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 2 years. Severity of depressive 
symptoms was rated utilizing the Geriatric Depression Scale. Disability was 
assessed utilizing the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ). Other clinical 
variables included white matter lesion (WML) and intracranial brain (ICV) 
volumes derived from magnetic resonance imaging, ratings of overall cognitive 
function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, ADAS), and apolipoprotein E 
(ApoE) status. Demographic variables included age, education, and gender.
RESULTS: SSD individuals had a lower volume of WML and higher frequency of ApoE 
ε4 alleles than nondepressed participants but the two groups did not differ with 
respect to other clinical or demographic variables. At baseline, SSD individuals 
were 1.77 times more likely to have poorer FAQ scores than individuals with no 
symptoms of depression after controlling for the effect of cognitive 
functioning, ICV, WML, and ApoE status. The presence of SSD at baseline was not 
associated with a poorer course of disability outcomes, cognitive functioning, 
or conversion to dementia over 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: SSD demonstrated a significant impact on disability for MCI 
individuals, who are also at high risk for functional limitations related to 
neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the treatment of SSD may represent a 
significant avenue to reduce the burden of disability in this vulnerable patient 
population.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to evaluate brain metabolism in mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with and without apathy (as determined by 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire).
METHODS: Baseline data from 65 MCI participants (11 with apathy and 54 without) 
from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative study were analyzed. 
All participants underwent a comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric 
assessment, volumetric MRI and measures of cerebral glucose metabolism applying 
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography at baseline. The presence 
of apathy at baseline was determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: There was no difference between apathy and apathy-free MCI patients 
regarding cognitive assessment and neuropsychiatric measures when 
apathy-specific items were removed. Cerebrovascular disease load and cerebral 
atrophy were equivalent in both groups. Compared with the apathy-free MCI 
patients, MCI patients with apathy had significantly decreased metabolism in the 
posterior cingulate cortex.
CONCLUSION: The presence of apathy in MCI patients is associated with 
AD-specific pattern of brain metabolic defect. These results could suggest that 
apathy belongs to the spectrum of prodromal AD symptoms.

We propose a new method of measuring atrophy of brain structures by 
simultaneously segmenting longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) images. In this 
approach a 4D graph is used to represent the longitudinal data: edges are 
weighted based on spatial and intensity priors and connect spatially and 
temporally neighboring voxels represented by vertices in the graph. Solving the 
min-cut/max-flow problem on this graph yields the segmentation for all 
timepoints in a single step. By segmenting all timepoints simultaneously, a 
consistent and atrophy-sensitive segmentation is obtained. The application to 
hippocampal atrophy measurement in 568 image pairs (Baseline and Month 12 
follow-up) as well as 362 image triplets (Baseline, Month 12, and Month 24) from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) confirms previous 
findings for atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy aging. Highly 
significant correlations between hippocampal atrophy and clinical variables 
(Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR) were 
found and atrophy rates differ significantly according to subjects' ApoE 
genotype. Based on one year atrophy rates, a correct classification rate of 82% 
between AD and control subjects is achieved. Subjects that converted from Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD after the period for which atrophy was measured 
(i.e., after the first 12 months) and subjects for whom conversion is yet to be 
identified were discriminated with a rate of 64%, a promising result with a view 
to clinical application. Power analysis shows that 67 and 206 subjects are 
needed for the AD and MCI groups respectively to detect a 25% change in volume 
loss with 80% power and 5% significance.

Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is a powerful method to map the 3D profile of 
brain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). We optimized a TBM-based image analysis method to determine what 
methodological factors, and which image-derived measures, maximize statistical 
power to track brain change. 3D maps, tracking rates of structural atrophy over 
time, were created from 1030 longitudinal brain MRI scans (1-year follow-up) of 
104 AD patients (age: 75.7+/-7.2 years; MMSE: 23.3+/-1.8, at baseline), 254 
amnestic MCI subjects (75.0+/-7.2 years; 27.0+/-1.8), and 157 healthy elderly 
subjects (75.9+/-5.1 years; 29.1+/-1.0), as part of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To determine which TBM designs gave greatest 
statistical power, we compared different linear and nonlinear registration 
parameters (including different regularization functions), and different 
numerical summary measures derived from the maps. Detection power was greatly 
enhanced by summarizing changes in a statistically-defined region-of-interest 
(ROI) derived from an independent training sample of 22 AD patients. Effect 
sizes were compared using cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots and false 
discovery rate methods. In power analyses, the best method required only 48 AD 
and 88 MCI subjects to give 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean 
annual change using a two-sided test (at alpha=0.05). This is a drastic sample 
size reduction relative to using clinical scores as outcome measures (619 
AD/6797 MCI for the ADAS-Cog, and 408 AD/796 MCI for the Clinical Dementia 
Rating sum-of-boxes scores). TBM offers high statistical power to track brain 
changes in large, multi-site neuroimaging studies and clinical trials of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the degree to which longitudinal stability of 
subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) is associated with conversion to 
dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Data from 405 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were analyzed. Participants were evaluated 
at baseline and 12-month intervals over 3 years. Participants were designated as 
MCI converters if dementia was diagnosed within 3 years or as cognitively stable 
MCI if dementia was not diagnosed during this interval. SSD were evaluated 
utilizing the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Endorsement of specific 
SSD at baseline and the stability of SSD over 36 months were compared between 
the two MCI groups.
RESULTS: Baseline symptom endorsement and stability of total GDS scores did not 
differentiate MCI groups. Worsening of four individual items from the GDS over 
time (memory problems, feelings of helplessness, loss of interest, and 
preference for staying at home) differentiated MCI converters from cognitively 
stable MCI (p < 0.05 for all). However, only increased endorsement of memory 
symptoms over time was associated with progression to dementia after controlling 
for other clinical variables (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SSD in MCI participants largely consist of cognitive symptoms and 
activity limitations, and the stability of SSD over time differentiated the MCI 
groups better than baseline endorsement of symptoms. However, the only 
significant predictor of conversion to dementia was increased endorsement of 
memory problems, which likely represents insight into cognitive problems more 
than depressive symptomatology in MCI individuals.

Late life depression (LLD) even in subsyndromal stages shows high conversion 
rates from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results 
of [(18)F]-fluorodesoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography (FDG-PET) were 
inconsistent in LLD patients, whereas atrophy was repeatedly described. 
Therefore, we set out to investigate FDG metabolism and the effect of atrophy 
correction (PVEC) in geriatric CN patients with depressive symptoms. 21 CN 
subjects with positive item for the depression category (DEP) in the 
Neuropsychiatric-Inventory-Questionnaire and 29 CN subjects with an absent 
depression item (NON-DEP) were selected from the ADNI cohort. FDG-PETs were 
analyzed in individual PET space using volumes-of-interest (VOI) and 
statistical-parametric-mapping (SPM) approaches. VOI- and MRI-based PVEC were 
applied to PET data. DEP subjects showed significant hypometabolism in 
fronto-temporal cortices and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) when 
contrasted against NON-DEP in uncorrected data. Both in VOI- and SPM-based 
approaches PVEC eliminated significance in PCC, while fronto-temporal regions 
remained significant or even attained significance such as in case of the left 
amygdala. Subsyndromally depressed CN subjects had decreased FDG metabolism in 
mood-related brain regions, which may be relevant to their elevated risk for 
conversion from CN to MCI. Methodological advances in PET analyses should be 
considered in future studies as PVEC relevantly changed results of FDG-PET for 
detecting apparent metabolic differences between DEP and NON-DEP subjects. 
Furthermore, VOI-based analyses in individual PET space will allow a more 
accurate consideration of variability in anatomy, especially in subcortical 
regions.

Clinical trials of disease modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might benefit from enrichment with 
true AD cases. Four hundred five MCI patients (143 converters and 262 
nonconverters to AD within 2 years) of the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) were used. Markers for enrichment were hippocampal atrophy on 
magnetic resonance (MRI), temporoparietal hypometabolism on FDG PET, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, and phospho-tau), and 
cortical amyloid deposition (11C-PIB positron emission tomography (PET)). Two 
separate enrichment strategies were tested to A) maximize the proportion of MCI 
converters screened in, and B) minimize the proportion of MCI converters 
screened out. Based on strategy A, when compared with no enrichment and ADAS-Cog 
as an outcome measure (sample size of 834), enrichment with 18F-FDG PET and 
hippocampal volume lowered samples size to 260 and 277 cases per arm, but at the 
cost of screening out 1,597 and 434 cases per arm. When compared with no 
enrichment and clinical dementia rating (CDR-SOB) as an outcome measure (sample 
size of 674), enrichment with hippocampal volume and Abeta42 lowered sample 
sizes to 191 and 291 cases per arm, with 639 and 157 screened out cases. 
Strategy B reduced the number of screened out cases (740 for [11C]-PIB PET, 101 
hippocampal volume, 82 ADAS-COG and 330 for [18F]-FDG PET) but at the expense of 
decreased power and a relative increase size (740 for [11C]-PIB PET, 676 for 
hippocampal volume, 744 for ADAS-Cog, and 517 for [18F]-FDG PET). Enrichment 
comes at the price of an often relevant proportion of screened out cases, and in 
clinical trial settings, the balance between enrichment of screened in and loss 
of screened out patients should be critically discussed.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine whether sex or 
education level affects the longitudinal rate of cognitive decline in Japanese 
patients in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative study with defined 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We accessed the entire Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative data set of 537 individuals, among whom 234 had MCI and 149 had 
Alzheimer's disease. We classified participants into three categories of 
educational history: (1) low, 0 to 9 years; (2) moderate, 10 to 15 years; and 
(3) high ≥16 years. We examined the main effects and interactions of visit, sex, 
and educational achievement on scores for the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of 
Boxes, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13, Mini-Mental 
State Examination, and Functional Activities Questionnaire in a longitudinal 
manner.
RESULTS: Women with MCI had a significantly faster rate of decline than men over 
a 3-year period. Highly educated men showed a significantly slower rate of 
decline than the other groups. Sex differences in the rates of decline remained 
after stratification by amyloid or apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status but were 
absent in Alzheimer's disease over a 2-year period. Subtle differences in 
chronic kidney disease grade affected the rate of decline. A higher Fazekas 
periventricular hyperintensity score was associated with a lower estimated 
glomerular filtration rate in women only.
DISCUSSION: In patients with MCI, sex and educational history significantly 
affected the rate of change in cognitive and clinical assessments. Furthermore, 
a subtle decline in chronic kidney disease grade was associated with a faster 
rate of decline regardless of amyloid pathology in women.

In one of the largest brain MRI studies to date, we used tensor-based 
morphometry (TBM) to create 3D maps of structural atrophy in 676 subjects with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy elderly 
controls, scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). Using inverse-consistent 3D non-linear elastic image registration, we 
warped 676 individual brain MRI volumes to a population mean geometric template. 
Jacobian determinant maps were created, revealing the 3D profile of local 
volumetric expansion and compression. We compared the anatomical distribution of 
atrophy in 165 AD patients (age: 75.6+/-7.6 years), 330 MCI subjects 
(74.8+/-7.5), and 181 controls (75.9+/-5.1). Brain atrophy in selected 
regions-of-interest was correlated with clinical measurements--the sum-of-boxes 
clinical dementia rating (CDR-SB), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and the 
logical memory test scores - at voxel level followed by correction for multiple 
comparisons. Baseline temporal lobe atrophy correlated with current cognitive 
performance, future cognitive decline, and conversion from MCI to AD over the 
following year; it predicted future decline even in healthy subjects. Over half 
of the AD and MCI subjects carried the ApoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) gene, which 
increases risk for AD; they showed greater hippocampal and temporal lobe 
deficits than non-carriers. ApoE2 gene carriers--1/6 of the normal group--showed 
reduced ventricular expansion, suggesting a protective effect. As an automated 
image analysis technique, TBM reveals 3D correlations between neuroimaging 
markers, genes, and future clinical changes, and is highly efficient for 
large-scale MRI studies.

Tensor-based morphometry can recover three-dimensional longitudinal brain 
changes over time by nonlinearly registering baseline to follow-up MRI scans of 
the same subject. Here, we compared the anatomical distribution of longitudinal 
brain structural changes, over 12 months, using a subset of the ADNI dataset 
consisting of 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 40 healthy elderly 
controls, and 40 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Each 
individual longitudinal change map (Jacobian map) was created using an unbiased 
registration technique, and spatially normalized to a geometrically-centered 
average image based on healthy controls. Voxelwise statistical analyses revealed 
regional differences in atrophy rates, and these differences were correlated 
with clinical measures and biomarkers. Consistent with prior studies, we 
detected widespread cerebral atrophy in AD, and a more restricted atrophic 
pattern in MCI. In MCI, temporal lobe atrophy rates were correlated with changes 
in mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores, clinical dementia rating (CDR), and 
logical/verbal learning memory scores. In AD, temporal atrophy rates were 
correlated with several biomarker indices, including a higher CSF level of p-tau 
protein, and a greater CSF tau/beta amyloid 1-42 (ABeta42) ratio. Temporal lobe 
atrophy was significantly faster in MCI subjects who converted to AD than in 
non-converters. Serial MRI scans can therefore be analyzed with nonlinear image 
registration to relate ongoing neurodegeneration to a variety of pathological 
biomarkers, cognitive changes, and conversion from MCI to AD, tracking disease 
progression in 3-dimensional detail.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are of great 
current research interest. While there is no consensus on whether MCIs actually 
"convert" to AD, this concept is widely applied. Thus, the more important 
question is not whether MCIs convert, but what is the best such definition. We 
focus on automatic prognostication, nominally using only a baseline brain image, 
of whether an MCI will convert within a multi-year period following the initial 
clinical visit. This is not a traditional supervised learning problem since, in 
ADNI, there are no definitive labeled conversion examples. It is not 
unsupervised, either, since there are (labeled) ADs and Controls, as well as 
cognitive scores for MCIs. Prior works have defined MCI subclasses based on 
whether or not clinical scores significantly change from baseline. There are 
concerns with these definitions, however, since, e.g., most MCIs (and ADs) do 
not change from a baseline CDR = 0.5 at any subsequent visit in ADNI, even while 
physiological changes may be occurring. These works ignore rich phenotypical 
information in an MCI patient's brain scan and labeled AD and Control examples, 
in defining conversion. We propose an innovative definition, wherein an MCI is a 
converter if any of the patient's brain scans are classified "AD" by a 
Control-AD classifier. This definition bootstraps design of a second classifier, 
specifically trained to predict whether or not MCIs will convert. We thus 
predict whether an AD-Control classifier will predict that a patient has AD. Our 
results demonstrate that this definition leads not only to much higher 
prognostic accuracy than by-CDR conversion, but also to subpopulations more 
consistent with known AD biomarkers (including CSF markers). We also identify 
key prognostic brain region biomarkers.

Understanding the time-dependent changes of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is a key to assessing disease progression and measuring the 
outcomes of disease-modifying therapies. In this article, we validate an AD 
progression score model which uses multiple biomarkers to quantify the AD 
progression of subjects following 3 assumptions: (1) there is a unique disease 
progression for all subjects; (2) each subject has a different age of onset and 
rate of progression; and (3) each biomarker is sigmoidal as a function of 
disease progression. Fitting the parameters of this model is a challenging 
problem which we approach using an alternating least squares optimization 
algorithm. To validate this optimization scheme under realistic conditions, we 
use the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. With the help of 
Monte Carlo simulations, we show that most of the global parameters of the model 
are tightly estimated, thus enabling an ordering of the biomarkers that fit the 
model well, ordered as: the Rey auditory verbal learning test with 30 minutes 
delay, the sum of the 2 lateral hippocampal volumes divided by the intracranial 
volume, followed (by the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes score and the 
mini-mental state examination score) in no particular order and at last the AD 
assessment scale-cognitive subscale.

Volume losses in the medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulated, and 
orbitofrontal region have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Smaller 
reductions in similar regions have also been reported in amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI), a canonical precursor to AD. We previously demonstrated that 
volume loss in bilateral anteromedial temporal lobe is present at baseline in 
longitudinally followed normal subjects who later developed MCI or AD. In this 
study we compared grey matter volumes within this predefined anteromedial 
temporal region (AMTR) at baseline between: 1) normal subjects enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who subsequently developed 
cognitive complaints as reflected in a CDR memory box score of 0.5; and 2) 
normal subjects who remained normal over a median of 48 months of follow-up (CDR 
sum of boxes 0). We found significantly decreased volume within AMTR in the ADNI 
memory complainers. To relate AMTR results to those from conventional anatomy, 
we demonstrate that volumes extracted with the ICBM amygdala region had the best 
correspondence with AMTR volumes. In contrast, regions that have demonstrated 
volume loss in frank MCI and AD in ADNI, e.g., the posterior cingulate, did not 
show volume loss. These findings provide independent confirmation that volume 
changes preceding MCI occur in AMTR, a region of overlap between amygdala and 
anterior hippocampus.

The pathological study of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was very few. 
Consecutive 1,628 autopsy cases from the Brain Bank for Aging Research (BBAR) 
with the mean age of 80.7 years were employed for this study. All the cases were 
studied with the BBAR protocol (www.mci.gr.jp/BrainBank/) and clasasified into 
Braak's seven neuforibrillary tangle (NFT) stages (0-VII) and four senile plaque 
(SP) stages (0-C). CDR from the most recent 545 cases were independently 
evaluated by three neurologists in two different occasions. Among the 1,628 
cases, 10.1% fulfilled morphological requirement of Alzheimer disease, 
consisting of NFT stage equal to or more than IV and SP stage equal to or more 
than C. Postmortem assessment of CDR was possible for 486 cases amoug 545 cases 
with frozem half brain and 57 cases were classified into CDR 0.5. CDR 0.5 group 
was clinicopathologically classified into 33 cases with degenerative changes, 
nine cases with vascular changes and four cases with combined degenerative and 
vascular changes. Only 6 among the 57 cases presented pure AD pathology. These 
data indicate that the pathological background of MCI is not always Alzheimer 
disease and combined pathology with AD as well as non-AD pathology should be 
carefully ruled out. For this purpose, ADNI (Alzheimer Disease Neuroimage 
Initiative) approach could be useful to identify MCI stage of AD.
