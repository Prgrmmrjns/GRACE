                "summary": "The model predicts mortality by integrating key clinical features that reflect neurological status, hemodynamic stability, metabolic balance, and immune response. It captures complex interactions among vital signs, laboratory values, and neurological assessments, reflecting underlying pathophysiological mechanisms such as organ dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and metabolic derangements.",
                "feature_importance_analysis": "The most influential features include GCS, FoleymL_sum, and anchor_age. GCS indicates neurological function, crucial in critical illness prognosis. FoleymL_sum, representing a composite neurological score, further emphasizes neurological status. Age is a well-known risk factor for mortality, with older patients generally having poorer outcomes. Other important features like MotorResponse, Aniongap, and LacticAcid reflect neurological responsiveness, metabolic acidosis, and tissue hypoxia, respectively, all of which are associated with increased mortality risk.",
                "interaction_analysis": "Key interactions involve vital signs and laboratory markers that reflect systemic physiological responses. For example, HRbpm's interactions with ABPmmmHg and WBC suggest that cardiovascular and immune responses are interconnected in influencing outcomes. Similarly, interactions between ABPmmmHg and metabolic markers like LacticAcid highlight the link between hemodynamic stability and tissue perfusion. These interactions mirror known pathophysiological processes such as shock, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.",
                "clinical_insights": "Clinically, the model underscores the importance of neurological assessment (GCS, MotorResponse, EyeOpening) and metabolic parameters (LacticAcid, Aniongap) in mortality risk stratification. It suggests that early identification of neurological deterioration and metabolic imbalance can guide aggressive interventions. The interactions imply that monitoring combined vital sign and laboratory trends provides a more comprehensive risk assessment, supporting integrated clinical decision-making.",
                "limitations": "The model's limitations include potential biases inherent in the dataset, such as selection bias and missing data. Its reliance on selected features may overlook other relevant variables. The model's interpretability is constrained by the complexity of feature interactions, and it may not generalize well to different populations or settings. Additionally, the observational nature of the data limits causal inference.",
                "recommendations": "For clinical use, the model should be integrated into decision support systems with continuous validation across diverse cohorts. Further research should explore causal mechanisms underlying feature interactions. Enhancing model transparency and incorporating clinician feedback can improve trust and utility. Prospective studies are needed to assess whether interventions guided by model predictions improve patient outcomes."
