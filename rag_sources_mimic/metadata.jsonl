The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare the outcomes of the three groups. The relationship between TyG-BMI index and 365-day mortality was assessed using multivariate Cox proportional risk regression models and restricted cubic spline curves (RCS).889 critically ill patients with CHD were analyzed. Among them, 600 (67.50%) were male patients with a mean age of 68.37 years and 289 (32.50%) were female patients with a mean age of 73.91 years. Patients with a medium TyG-BMI index had the best 365-day prognostic outcome and the highest survival rate compared with patients in the Low and High TyG-BMI index groups [201 (67.68%) vs. 166 (56.08%), 188 (63.51%); P=0.013].

This study investigated the relationship between the TyG index and short-term prognosis in patients with critical care AF. We selected critically ill patients with AF from the MIMIC-IV database and categorized them into quartiles based on their TyG index levels. The primary outcome assessed was 30-day all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes of 7-day and 15-day all-cause mortality. We utilized Kaplan-Meier survival curves, restricted cubic spline, and Cox proportional hazards regression models to illustrate the relationship between the TyG index and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with AF. 1,146 critically ill patients with AF were included in this study, with a mean age of 75.90. The female population accounted for 48.43% of the total. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated a significant association between the TyG index and all-cause mortality at 7, 15, and 30 days. Cox proportional hazards analysis, after adjusting for multiple confounders, revealed a substantial increase in all-cause mortality in the fourth quartile of the TyG index compared to the first quartile (HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.17-2.49). Restricted cubic spline further illustrated that higher TyG index were associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AF. The stratified analysis provided additional support for the robustness of this association. The TyG index demonstrated a significant association with 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AF. These findings suggest that the TyG index may serve as a useful tool in identifying AF patients at a higher risk of all-cause mortality, enabling early and effective intervention strategies.", "source": "pubmed"}

Recent studies suggest hyperandrogenism alters sex hormone levels, contributing to gestational cardiovascular disease CVD. Most of the factors behind the onset of CVD in postpartum women remain unknown. Animal studies mimic adverse pregnancy outcomes to explore molecular causes of severe prenatal cardiac events and their role in postpartum cardiovascular disease development. This review will be focused on summarising human and animal research that shows how undesirable pregnancy outcomes, such as obesity in the mother and gestational diabetes (GD), have an impact on postpartum cardiovascular disease and prenatal cardiometabolic dysfunction. We will highlight the adverse effects of gestational hyperandrogenism as a potential biomarker for cardiovascular dysfunction in pregnant women and new mothers. Investigative cardiovascular (CV) risk variables in the early postpartum phase following pregnancy that were impacted by GD was the aim of this study. Current research strongly implies that women with GDM have a higher risk of developing CVD. Finding appropriate, reliable indicators of CVD and specific treatment modalities that can control obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are critical to reducing the burden of CVD on impacted women. GD and hypertensive disorders are two pregnancy- related illnesses that raise the risk of CVD in the long run.

GV was quantified using the coefficient of variation (CV), calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean blood glucose level. The association between GV and clinical outcomes was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were employed to examine the nonlinear relationship between GV and short- and long-term all-cause mortality.A total of 2,240 ICU patients with HS were included in this study. In fully adjusted models, RCS analyses revealed a U-shaped association between the CV and both short- and long-term all-cause mortality (P for nonlinearity < 0.001 for all outcomes). Two-piecewise Cox regression models were subsequently applied to identify CV thresholds. The thresholds for all-cause mortality in ICU, during hospitalization, and at 30, 90, and 180 days were determined to be 0.14, 0.16, 0.155, 0.14, and 0.14, respectively.

Body mass index (BMI) was divided into quartiles, and mortality rates were assessed for each interval. Logistic trend tests and subgroup and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were performed. Blood biochemical indicators were compared across different BMI ranges and between survivors and non-survivors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for 28-day mortality was also evaluated.The 28-day mortality of sepsis patients followed a U-shaped pattern with increasing BMI. Trend analysis confirmed that BMI was a significant risk factor for 28-day mortality (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed an interactive effect of BMI on 28-day mortality in elderly (≥ 65 years old), male, and non-septic shock individuals (p < 0.05). A higher BMI was associated with an increased lymphocyte proportion and decreased neutrophil proportion, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) (p < 0.05).

The primary outcomes were 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to clarify the relationship between Braden score and primary outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and stratified analysis were used to verify our findings.A total of 8,290 patients were included in our study, during the 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day follow-up periods, mortality was recorded in 1,554, 1,938, and 2,173 patients, those with lower Braden score had a 58% increased risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38, 1.81), a 50% increased risk of 60-day mortality(HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.33,1.70), and a 52% increased risk of 90-day mortality(HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.35,1.70). Patients with lower Braden score received more mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, and presented with elevated WBC counts and lactate levels. In addition, lower Braden scores were also linked to increased adjusted ICU mortality and a higher incidence of AKI within the first seven days following ICU admission.Lower Braden score is an independent risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.

However, effectively stratifying SALI patients according to prognosis remains challenging. This study evaluates laboratory-based clustering filters for stratifying SALI patients by 30-day mortality risk, utilizing data mining techniques for novel pattern discovery.This retrospective cohort study analyzed SALI patients from two ICU databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (n = 73,181, study period: 2008 to 2019) and Amsterdam UMC (n = 16,194, study period: 2003 to 2016). Patients were identified using Sepsis-3 criteria and liver injury markers. Risk stratification employed three laboratory-based approaches: (I) De Ritis ratio (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase), (II) R-factor (alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase relative to their upper limits of normal), and (III) alanine aminotransferase elevation. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression assessed the association between stratification methods and 30-day mortality risk.SALI patients had almost a 2-fold higher risk of 30-day mortality than those without SALI (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95%-CI: 1.58-1.90, p < 0.0001). Each stratification method (I-III) successfully classified patients into statistically distinct risk strata. The De Ritis ratio emerged as the strongest prognostic differentiation method: a ratio ≤1 indicated no significant increase in mortality risk (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95%-CI: 0.68-1.09, p = 0.21), whereas ratios of 1-2 and ≥2 were significantly associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio: 1.56; 95%-CI: 1.37-1.78, p < 0.0001 and hazard ratio: 2.46; 95%-CI: 2.18-2.77, p < 0.0001, respectively).

The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including the need for life-support therapies. Associations between leukocyte trajectories and outcomes were assessed using multivariate regression, and findings were externally validated with the eICU database. Use the XGBoost model to identify baseline characteristics of high-risk mortality sepsis subgroups for predicting subgroup allocation upon patient admission to the ICU, and apply the SHAP method to interpret the contributing variables of the model. Among 7410 sepsis patients, eight distinct leukocyte trajectory subtypes were identified. Among those subtypes, patients with persistently high leukocyte levels had the poorest prognosis (HR 3.00; 95% CI 2.48-3.62) and a significantly greater need for life-support therapies; Patients with persistently low white blood cell levels had a higher risk of death (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.24-2.27) but were less likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation.

Then, Utilizing the retrospective data from the ICU at Jiangbei Hospital in Nanjing, China, from 2014 to 2024 (n = 200) for external model validation, the model was evaluated with discriminant analysis, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, and rationality analysis.A total of 883 critically ill patients undergoing CRRT were included, consisting of 542 males and 341 females, with a mean age of 65 ± 14 years. Additionally, there were 618 patients in the training set and 265 in the validation set. A total of 47 independent variables were obtained, among which 15 independent variables were screened with LASSO regression and included in the multivariate logistic analysis. The five risk factors ultimately included in the prediction model were height, hepatic insufficiency, mechanical ventilation, prefilter replacement rate, and albumin. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the model was 0.758 (0.701-0.816), 0.747 (0.678-0.817), and 0.714 (0.632-0.810) for the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set, respectively. The calibration curves in the training set and internal/external validation sets showed a high degree of consistency between predicted values and observed values (according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, the P-values were 0.7673, 0.2401, and 0.4512 for the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set, respectively). In addition, the Decision-Curve(DCA) revealed that the model had good clinical applicability. Nomo-score comparisons exhibited the rationality of the model.The model developed based on LASSO-logistic regression can reliably predict the risk of citrate accumulation in critically ill patients with citrate anticoagulation for CRRT, providing valuable guidance for the application of early measures to prevent the occurrence of citrate accumulation and to improve the prognosis of patients.", "source": "pubmed"}

However, its prognostic value in SA-AKI remains unexplored.This retrospective cohort study analyzed SA-AKI patients in the MIMIC-IV database. Cox regression assessed the association between PIV and mortality, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression explored the relationship between PIV and 30-day and 365-day mortality.A total of 2,473 SA-AKI patients in our study were categorized into PIV quartiles: T1 (≤ 214), T2 (214-679), T3 (679-2,039), and T4 (> 2,039). PIV showed a nonlinear association with mortality. Higher PIV quartiles were linked to increased mortality, with 30-day rates of 26%, 22%, 35%, and 41% (P < 0.001) and 365-day mortality rates of 34%, 31%, 46%, and 54% (P < 0.001).

On the whole, a cohort of 3,197 SAD patients were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Among them, a total of 659 (20.61%) patients died following SAD. The patients who died were about 73.00 (62.00, 82.00) years old and mostly male (56.75%). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to distinguish risk factors. Subsequently, six ML algorithms including artificial neural network (NNET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adaptive boosting (Ada), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and logistic regression (LR) were employed to establish models to predict the 30-day mortality of SAD. The performance of models was assessed via both discrimination and calibration by cross-validation with 100 resamples. Overall, 10 independent predictors, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), anion gap (AG), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), temperature, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), vasopressor, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), base excess (BE), and bicarbonate were identified as independent predictors for the 30-day mortality of SAD. The validation cohort demonstrated that all these six models had relatively favorable differentiation, while among them, the GBM model had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.845 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.816, 0.874). Furthermore, the calibration curve of these six models was close to the diagonal line in the validation sets. As for decision curve analysis, the predictive models were clinically useful as well. Based on real-world research, we developed ML models to provide personalized predictions of delirium-related mortality in sepsis patients, potentially enabling clinicians to identify high-risk SAD patients more promptly.", "source": "pubmed"}

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio (LDAR) for predicting 28-day ICU mortality in septic patients with malignancies.A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using data from 1,635 septic patients with malignancies in the MIMIC-IV (3.1) database. Participants were stratified into quartiles based on LDAR values. The primary outcome was 28-day ICU mortality, with secondary outcomes including in-hospital and ICU mortality. Multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and machine learning models were employed to assess associations between LDAR and outcomes. Subgroup analyses and feature importance evaluations were performed to validate robustness. The Shapley additive explanations method was used to enhance model interpretability and assess individual predictor contributions.Higher LDAR is independently associated with increased 28-day ICU mortality (OR: 3.441, 95% CI: 2.497-4.741), ICU mortality (OR: 3.478, 95% CI: 2.396-5.049), and in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.747, 95% CI: 2.688-5.222), even after adjustment, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in ICU patients.

Insulin resistance (IR) is a metabolic abnormality that has been shown to be quite prevalent among patients with hypertension in existing literature. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a reliable indicator for assessing insulin resistance (IR). This study aims to evaluate the relationship between the TyG index at admission and all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients with severe primary hypertension, and to explore its role in predicting the future all-cause mortality risk in primary hypertension patients. This study employs a retrospective design to categorize all patients into four quartiles based on the TyG index. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was utilized to estimate the survival curves for each group and to compare the survival outcomes across different quartiles. To assess the nonlinear relationship between the TyG index and prognosis, Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were applied, adjusting for potential confounders. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to conduct stratified analyses and interaction tests. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that patients with higher TyG index levels had higher all-cause mortality rates at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days post-admission. This indicates that a higher TyG index is associated with an increased risk of death in the short term. Additionally, multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that an increased TyG index was significantly associated with all-cause mortality at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days. Meanwhile, RCS analysis indicates that as the TyG index level increases, the hazard ratio (HR) shows a significant upward trend, suggesting a gradual increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. In summary, among patients with primary hypertension in the intensive care unit, elevated TyG levels are associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality.", "source": "pubmed"}

While estrogen deficiency has been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, the molecular mechanisms by which it exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, particularly in the presence of elevated glucocorticoid levels, remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore the role of FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) in mediating glucocorticoid-induced endothelial dysfunction in estrogen-deficient females.Estrogen deficiency was developed in female mice by ovariectomy (OVX). Female mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) to mimic elevated cortisol levels in vivo and vitro. Endothelial function of the mice aorta was assessed using wire myography. Oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, immunofluorescence and mRNA expression analysis. The selective FKBP5 inhibitor SAFit2 was used to study the functional role of FKBP5 in these processes.Estrogen deficiency contributed to endothelial dysfunction in female mice, an effect exacerbated by elevated glucocorticoid levels. FKBP5 expression was upregulated in both ovariectomized mice aortas and DEX-treated endothelial cells. Inhibition of FKBP5 reversed endothelial dysfunction, reduced ROS levels, and suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, including ICAM-1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB.FKBP5 mediates glucocorticoid-induced endothelial dysfunction under estrogen-deficient conditions. Inhibition of FKBP5 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and improve vascular health in estrogen-deficient women.", "source": "pubmed"}

AF with RVR was defined as a heart rate (HR) >110 beats/min (bpm) during an episode of AF and was further classified into three categories: mild (111-130 bpm), moderate (131-150 bpm) and severe (>150 bpm) RVR. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs and to explore linear and non-linear relationships of RVR and mortality, respectively.A total of 7027 eligible patients with AF were identified, and AF with RVR occurred in 5274 patients (75.1%). Patients with RVR had a significantly higher hospital mortality compared to those without (23.8% vs. 15.8%, adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI (1.13-1.54), p < .001). The adjusted ORs in mild, moderate and severe RVR were 1.11 (0.93-1.33), 1.25 (1.05-1.49) and 1.87 (1.54-2.27) for hospital mortality (p for trend <.001), respectively. Restricted cubic spline analyses showed a non-linear relationship of RVR with hospital mortality (p < .001). Additionally, hospital mortality decreased linearly with the reduction in 1-h HR following moderate and severe RVR.AF with moderate and severe RVR was associated with increased hospital mortality in critically ill patients, and acute HR reduction following moderate and severe RVR may be beneficial in reducing hospital mortality.This study emphasized the importance of individual management of AF patients in the ICU according to the severity of RVR and provided an approximate range of RVR to guide risk stratification.", "source": "pubmed"}

Primary outcomes were defined as the incidence and 360-day mortality of in-hospital NOAF among patients with sepsis. Logistic model, Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were performed to explore the association between the indices and clinical outcomes. Machine learning approach also was constructed to evaluate and compare the indices in predicting mortality risks.4276 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and 764 individuals developed NOAF during hospitalization. The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95%, CI) of incidence of NOAF in patients with sepsis in the highest group versus the lowest group were 1.36 (1.10-1.69), 1.35 (1.09-1.67) and 1.58 (1.23-2.02), respectively, for the TyG index, SHR and the TyG index-SHR combination.

Patients with both the highest the TyG index and the highest SHR demonstrated the highest risk of 360-day mortality (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.72). The ROC also confirmed the TyG index-SHR combination had more robust predictive power for 360-day mortality among septic patients with NOAF than the TyG index and SHR itself (p < 0.05).

Accurately predicting risk can facilitate earlier interventions and improve patient outcomes. This study leveraged the MIMIC III database, identifying traumatic brain injury cases through standardized clinical criteria. A rigorous data preprocessing workflow included missing value imputation, correlation checks, and expert-driven feature selection, reducing an initial set of features to a subset of critical predictors encompassing demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and clinical interventions. To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied within a five-fold cross-validation framework, ensuring a balanced training set while maintaining an unbiased validation process. Six machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network, and AdaBoost, were trained using extensive hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted based on multiple metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative Predictive Value. XGBoost emerged as the top performing algorithm, achieving an AUC of 0.94 and an accuracy of 0.875 on the test set, marking substantial improvements over previously reported best results. An ablation study validated the necessity of each retained feature, indicating that any feature removal led to a decline in model performance. Furthermore, SHAP analysis underscored ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, serum potassium, and blood urea nitrogen as key contributors to ventilator associated pneumonia risk. Overall, the results demonstrate that advanced ensemble learning, meticulous feature selection, and effective class imbalance handling can significantly enhance early detection in traumatic brain injury cases. These findings have meaningful clinical implications, offering a framework for more timely interventions, optimized resource allocation, and improved patient care in critical settings.", "source": "pubmed"}

In this retrospective study, participants from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database were categorized into two groups based on their Braden Scale (BS) scores: the high-risk group (BS ≤ 15) and the low-risk group (BS > 15). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 3 months. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to examine the association between BS and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A restricted cubic spline model was employed to assess the relationship between BS and outcomes. A total of 750 patients were included in the study, with 43% being male. The mortality rates at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year were 21%, 25%, and 29%, respectively.

A considerable proportion of these tumors are treated by unplanned excision before referral to a specialist oncological center. Additionally, hand sarcomas can mimic benign lesions, leading to misinterpretation and delayed diagnosis. To address these challenges, it is essential to thoroughly investigate all atypical soft tissue masses arising in the hand. Surgery is indeed considered the primary treatment for STS of the hand. However, achieving wide surgical margins can be particularly challenging in this area due to the intricate anatomy and proximity of tumors to vital structures within the hand. Adjuvant radiotherapy plays a crucial role in achieving local tumor control by targeting microscopic tumor cells near the surgical bed. This approach allows for a planned close margin excision along critical structures, which is essential for reducing the risk of tumor recurrence while preserving hand function. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for synovial sarcoma of the hand is controversial and still a matter of intense debate. Distant metastasis and local recurrence are common in synovial sarcoma cases. They mostly metastasize to the lungs, followed by lymph nodes, bones, and the liver. Multidisciplinary discussions involving surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and other specialists are crucial in making informed decisions about the most appropriate treatment approach for each individual patient with STS of the hand. This collaborative approach ensures that the chosen treatment plan optimizes both oncological outcomes and the patient's overall quality of life.", "source": "pubmed"}

We used the RSF machine learning method to sort the importance of variables and found that SAPII score was the most important clinical variable. The restricted cubic splines (RCS) found that SAPII score was nonlinearly correlated with prognosis, and SAPII = 33 was the threshold associated with prognosis. SAPII score was the best compared with the other five scoring systems, and the AUC curve was 0.835 (95 %CI 0.801-0.870). We also found that SAPII score was the best in the validation cohort.SAPS II effectively predict 28-day mortality in ICU patients with APE, outperforming other commonly used scoring systems. It also provides practical thresholds for clinical risk stratification, which can enhance clinical decision-making and resource allocation in the ICU.", "source": "pubmed"}

Early prediction of prognosis in such patients is crucial. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) and outcomes in critically ill patients diagnosed with HF and diabetes.Data on critically ill HF patients with diabetes were retrospectively collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis identified a threshold value of 0.44, dividing patients into low-LAR (< 0.44) and high-LAR (≥ 0.44) groups. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with tenfold cross-validation identified variables associated with mortality. RCS, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the association between LAR and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of the findings.A total of 3,774 patients were included, with a determined LAR cutoff value of 0.44. RCS analysis revealed a positive correlation between LAR and all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year. Cox regression analysis showed that both low-LAR and high-LAR groups were independent risk factors for all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year in HF patients with diabetes (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the cumulative survival rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year were lower in the low-LAR group compared to the high-LAR group. Subgroup analyses confirmed the stability of the association between LAR and all-cause mortality at all time points.In summary, LAR is a reliable and independent predictor of increased mortality in critically ill HF patients with diabetes. However, additional comprehensive prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.", "source": "pubmed"}

The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has emerged as a promising predictor in various critical illnesses. However, its potential role in predicting all-cause mortality in patients with liver failure remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the correlation between LAR and all-cause mortality in patients suffering from liver failure.We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with liver failure who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2008 and 2019, which were gathered from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. LAR was calculated from the ratio obtained from the first measurement taken within 24 h of admission. The optimal LAR threshold was determined using the Youden index. With LAR categorized into low, middle, and high groups based on tertiles, Kaplan - Meier analysis was employed to compare mortality risks among three patient groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to evaluate the association between LAR and all-cause mortality in hepatic failure patients within hospital admission. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and smoothing curve analysis were used to assess the predictive ability, sensitivity, and specificity of LAR for all-cause mortality in patients with liver failure, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. A smooth curve fitting approach and threshold effect analysis were employed to detect the potentially non-linear relationship between the LAR and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with hepatic failure. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the relationship between LAR and prognosis across different types of liver failure.A total of 902 patients with hepatic failure were included in this study. They were divided into survivors group (611 patients) and non-survivors group (291 patients) according to whether they survived during hospitalization, and the mortality rate of patients was 32.26%. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrating patients in hepatic failure with elevated LAR showed a significantly heightened risk of in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). We identified a non-linear relationship between LAR and the risk of hospital mortality after adjusting for potential confounders and the inflection point of LAR to be 1.33. LAR was shown to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality within hospitalization in patients with hepatic failure by multivariate COX regression analysis (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.35-2.05; P < 0.0001). The optimal cutoff value for separating the survival and death groups according to ROC was found to be 0.97. The AUC value for LAR was 0.755 (95% CI: 0.721, 0.789), which was higher than that for arterial blood lactate (AUC = 0.725) and serum albumin (AUC = 0.680) alone. It was not inferior even when compared to MELD (AUC = 0.677).LAR has demonstrated good predictive value for all-cause mortality among liver failure patients in our retrospective study.", "source": "pubmed"}

Data encompassing demographic information, vital signs, laboratory results, and other relevant variables were collected. The class imbalance issue was addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The dataset was randomly split into training and testing sets (8:2). LASSO regression and feature importance scores were used for feature selection. Clinical prediction models were built using logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest and gradient boosting machine. The performance of the models was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis.Model calibration was assessed using calibration curves and Brier scores. The effectiveness was evaluated through Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). SHAP was utilized for model interpretation.Among 972 patients, 824 were non-MDROs-VAP and 128 were MDROs-VAP. Comparative analysis revealed statistically significant differences in various clinical parameters. XGBoost exhibited the best predictive performance, incorporating 20 features with an AUC of 0.831 (95 % CI: 0.785-0.877) on the test set. Calibration curves demonstrated robust consistency, corroborated by Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) affirming the clinical utility. SHAP analysis identified the most important features: red cell distribution width, duration of mechanical ventilation, anion gap, basophil percentage, and neutrophil percentage.This study established and compared four machine learning models for MDROs infections in VAP patients. XGBoost was identified as the optimal predictor, and SHAP values provided insights into 20 independent risk factors, confirming its excellent predictive value.VAP is a common infection in ICU patients with a heightened risk of MDRO and increased mortality.

We used routinely collected administrative and clinical national linked datasets from England to emulate the PR07 trial for high-risk prostate cancer patients, which compared the effects of radiotherapy added to hormone therapy (RT+HT) within 8 weeks of randomization (the \"grace period\") and hormone therapy (HT) only on all-cause mortality. We highlight methodological choices required and challenges encountered in emulating this trial.Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2014 to 2020 were identified from the routine national linked datasets. Diagnosis was taken as the time zero. As few patients initiated radiotherapy within 8 weeks of diagnosis, we considered target trials with grace periods of 4-6 months. Estimands of interest were hazard ratios (HRs) and survival probabilities over 7 years. The cloning-censoring-and-weighting (CCW) approach was used to control for measured confounding and to allow for the grace period. We also used an extension (the \"landmark-CCW\" approach), in which we consider several time-origins post-diagnosis, enabling us to use a grace period of 8 weeks as in PR07.A total of 2,690 patients were eligible for inclusion in the emulated trial. The CCW analysis using a grace period of 6 months gave an estimated HR of 0.48 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.60) and 7-year survival estimates of 80.7% (95% CI: 74.3-87.0) for the RT+HT strategy and 65.6% (95% CI: 62.8-68.1) for HT only strategy, and corresponding risk difference of 15.1% (95% CI: 11.5-18.9). The corresponding HR from the landmark-CCW approach was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65) and with survival estimates of 80.7% (95% CI: 77.7-83.8) for RT+HT strategy and 69.8% (95% CI: 68.2-71.4) for the HT only strategy, and a risk difference of 10.9% (95% CI: 6.3-15.9).Our findings from the emulated trial using RWD are broadly consistent with those from PR07, with RT+HT estimated to result in better survival compared to HT only. However, the findings were not replicated exactly, with PR07 reporting an HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61-0.98) over 7 years of follow-up. Differences may be in part due to challenges in defining time zero and allowing for a treatment grace period of the same duration as in PR07. Our study considered ways in which these challenges can be addressed, and our findings affirm the utility of RWD for estimating treatment effects.Clinical trials are the best way to test whether treatments work, but they are expensive, take years to complete, and focus on narrow research questions. If we can use real-world data (RWD) such as patient health records to mimic these trials, we may be able to answer additional medical questions relevant to patients who are prescribed these medications. This study aimed to see if we could recreate the results of a past clinical trial (PR07) using national health data from England. The PR07 trial looked at two treatments for high-risk prostate cancer: hormone therapy (HT) alone and radiotherapy added to hormone therapy (RT+HT) within 8 weeks of starting the study. This trial was chosen for several reasons. It included high-risk patients who were studied for up to 7 years, meaning that there was enough information to study survival outcomes. Being a major UK-based trial, it was useful for comparing with the data recorded in UK national health data. The trial also allowed some flexibility in when treatment started, which was an interesting factor to examine. Its main goal was to see if adding radiotherapy to hormone therapy provided extra benefits to patients. We wanted to see whether the trial results were replicated using the UK health data. If results were replicated, it would provide confidence in further exploration of questions not covered by the trial. In a trial, randomization time is the point where doctors allocate patients to one of the treatments being assessed, usually 1 new treatment and 1 control treatment. Patients in the study are then followed up from that point. However, defining a starting point in a non-trial setting, using UK national health data, is not as straightforward. In the PR07 trial, patients started RT+HT within 8 weeks of randomization. In the UK datasets, we use diagnosis as a starting point, because it is available for both treatment groups. However, very few patients started RT+HT within 8 weeks of diagnosis. To address this, we allowed for longer periods of 4-6 months from diagnosis for RT+HT initiation. Recent developments provided statistical methods for estimating the cause-effect relationship between treatment received and survival patterns. In this study, we show how these approaches can be used to estimate survival patterns if all patients had RT+HT within 4-6 months from diagnosis compared with if no patients had any RT within 4-6 months. We account for the different treatment initiation times and the main differences between the RT+HT and HT only patients. Using these methods, we estimate that RT+HT has an 11%-15% higher survival rate at 7 years compared to HT only. We discuss similarities and differences between these findings and those in the original PR07 trial.", "source": "pubmed"}

We used the Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the mortality risk among the different groups. To evaluate the relationship between coagulopathy score and mortality risk in patients with liver cirrhosis and sepsis, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed. The predictive performance of the coagulopathy score for short- and long-term all-cause mortality was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which included evaluation of its sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between coagulopathy score and survival across different groups.The study included a total of 2,278 patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that individuals with elevated coagulopathy scores exhibited markedly higher rates of ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, as well as 28-day and 90-day mortality, with all log-rank tests yielding P-values of less than 0.001. The results of the multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that an elevated coagulopathy score was independently linked to higher 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality, both before and after controlling for potential confounders. ROC curve analysis showed that although the coagulopathy score was slightly less predictive of prognosis than the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, it significantly outperformed the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and the Sepsis-induced Coagulopathy score. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant interaction between the coagulopathy score and survival across the different subgroups.Higher coagulopathy scores in critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis and sepsis were independently associated with poor prognosis.

Patients were divided into SAE and non-SAE groups for comparison. Multivariate regression identified independent risk factors for SAE and associated outcomes, including in-hospital mortality.Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) was identified as a key microbial risk factor for SAE (HR=1.919, P<0.001), though it was not associated with in-hospital mortality. Higher SOFA scores, mechanical ventilation, and prolonged antibiotic use significantly increased SAE risk. Laboratory tests revealed higher white blood cell counts, platelet levels, and metabolic abnormalities in SAE patients.

Emerging metrics such as the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), and glycemic variability (GV) offer advanced insights into glucose metabolism. However, their prognostic implications for short- and long-term outcomes post-TAVR remain underexplored.This retrospective cohort study analyzed 3342 ICU-admitted TAVR patients via the MIMIC-IV database. Patients were stratified into tertiles for HGI, SHR, and GV levels. Survival analyses, including Kaplan‒Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines (RCSs), were used to assess associations between glycemic control metrics and 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in these patients. Sensitivity analyses, subgroup assessments, and external validation were also performed to verify the study findings.During follow-up, 1.6% and 6.9% of patients experienced 30-day and 365-day mortality after TAVR, respectively. In the fully adjusted cox regression model, lower HGI (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.09, P = 0.025) and higher SHR (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15-2.32, P = 0.006) were most significantly associated with an increased risk of 365-day mortality. Higher SHR was also significantly associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality in patients (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.32-6.45, P = 0.008).

This multicenter retrospective cohort study analyzed 25,591 heart failure patients from two intensive care databases (eICU Collaborative Research Database [eICU-CRD] and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV [MIMIC-IV]). BPV was assessed using coefficient of variation of systolic (SBPV), diastolic (DBPV), and mean (MBPV) blood pressure measurements. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated mortality associations, adjusting for clinical parameters. The observed mortality rates were 14.7% (in-hospital) and 17.3% (30-day). Higher BPV demonstrated significant associations with increased mortality risk, with SBPV showing the strongest relationship. For in-hospital mortality, each standard deviation increase in SBPV, DBPV, and MBPV corresponded to adjusted odds ratios of 1.56 (95% CI 1.51-1.62), 1.21 (95% CI 1.16-1.25), and 1.42 (95% CI 1.37-1.48), respectively.

These associations remained robust across all patient subgroups. Increased blood pressure variability during hospitalization independently predicts higher in-hospital (14.7%) and 30-day mortality (17.3%) in HF patients, with SBPV showing the strongest association (OR: 1.56, 95% CI 1.51-1.62).

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identify adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of middle-aged subjects as potential causes of midlife obesity. Specifically, the extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from APCs display an impaired ability to mitigate the inflammaging of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in middle-aged individuals. Mechanistically, these EVs, lacking miR-145-5p, fail to suppress the expression of L-selectin in ATMs, thereby facilitating their M1 program via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In contrast, EVs from young APCs effectively inhibit M1 macrophage polarization. Accordingly, targeted liposomes are designed to deliver miR-145-5p mimics to ATMs, which effectively prevent the obesity in middle-aged mice. Collectively, our findings highlight the role of APC-derived EVs in midlife obesity and propose miR-145-5pas a promising therapeutic target for clinical applications.", "source": "pubmed"}

Hence, the primary objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the BUN/Cr ratio in patients with AP.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary exposure variable was the BUN/Cr ratio at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the primary outcome was 365-day all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess this relationship, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to explore potential non-linear associations.

It mainly affects patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Skin biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is an invasive procedure. Calciphylaxis frequently results in ischemic and nonhealing ulcerations with a high mortality rate. A multidisciplinary targeted approach is the primary treatment method. Vascular calcification, which is a common complication in patients with CKD, cannot completely explain the rapid progression of calciphylaxis. This article reviews the advances in the epidemiological characteristics, risk factors, and diagnosis, including non-uraemic calciphylaxis (NUC) and visceral calciphylaxis, pathogenesis, associated animal models, and treatment of calciphylaxis. The scarcity of animal models that mimic the clinical presentation of calciphylaxis hampers the understanding of its pathogenesis. The acute effects on progressive vascular injury, including the induction of severe ischemia and inflammatory responses, have been emphasized. Actively listening to the voices of patients and their families and building a multidimensional research system with artificial intelligence technologies based on the specific molecular makeup of calciphylaxis patients will help tailor regenerative treatment strategies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be proposed as a novel therapy for calciphylaxis because of their regenerative effects, inhibition of vascular calcification, anti-infection and immunomodulation properties, and improvement of hypercoagulability. Safe, effective, accessible, and economical MSC strategies guided by biomarkers deserve consideration for the treatment of this devastating disease.", "source": "pubmed"}

However, few studies have investigated the correlation between HGI and prognosis in patients with critical ischemic stroke.A cohort of patients was established from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate regression models, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to investigate the associations between HGI and different outcomes. Mediation models were constructed to determine the mediating role of white blood cell (WBC) counts.This study included 2,332 participants. In-hospital mortality differs significantly across HGI groups (24.43 %, 11.82 %, and 10.14 %, P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analyses found that lower HGI was significantly associated with greater mortality risk. Nonlinear analyses revealed an L-shaped association between HGI and short-term mortality (30-day and in-hospital), while a reverse J-shaped relationship emerged for long-term (365-day) mortality. Mediation analysis revealed that WBC counts mediated the association with proportions (%) of 33.73, 19.65, and 30.00, respectively.Lower HGI is consistently related to poorer outcomes in patients with critical ischemic stroke. Higher HGI could be a protective factor in the short term but might increase mortality risk in the long term. WBC counts significantly mediate the association.", "source": "pubmed"}

Several studies have validated the association between stress hyperglycemia ratio and cerebrovascular disease. However, the value of stress hyperglycemia ratio for severe stroke patients admitted to the ICU remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between stress hyperglycemia ratio and clinical short- and long-term prognosis of critically ill patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).Clinical data from 893 critically ill patients with ischemic stroke (IS) were extracted from the Medical Information Marketplace for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and 793 critically ill IS patients with 1 year of follow-up. The SHR is expressed by the formula: SHR = [(admission glucose (mg/dl)) / (28.7 × HbA1c (%) - 46.7)]. The study population was categorized into quartiles based on SHR level. Outcomes included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality. Cox proportional risk regression analysis and restricted cubic spline curves were used to elucidate the association between SHR and clinical prognosis in critically ill patients with AIS.There were 69 ICU deaths and 100 in-hospital deaths in cohort 1, and 229 patients experienced all-cause mortality during the 1-year follow-up in cohort 2. Multivariate Cox proportional risk analysis showed that elevated SHR was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital and 1-year all-cause mortality. After adjusting for confounders, patients with elevated SHR were significantly associated with hospital mortality (adjusted risk ratio, 1.870; 95 % confidence interval, 1.180-2.962; P = 0.008) and 1-year mortality (adjusted risk ratio, 2.325; 95 % confidence, 1.729-3.127; P < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline bars showed that a progressively increasing risk of all-cause mortality was associated with an elevated SHR.Stress hyperglycemia ratios were significantly associated with in-hospital and 1-year all-cause mortality in critically ill IS patients. Moreover, we found that non-diabetic and prediabetic patients showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality. It is suggested that SHR may be useful in identifying ischemic stroke patients at high risk of all-cause mortality and providing personalized interventions as early as possible.", "source": "pubmed"}

Listless asymptomatic growth had resulted in delay in presentation of 2.3 years. Tumor size was significantly more in FS-DFSP (P 0.005). Higher mitotic rate is found to have strong association with FS-DFSP (P 0.0001). FS-DFSP has more recurrences compared with non-FS-DFSP (P 0.0001). DFSP with FS transformation was more aggressive as there was significant difference in metastasis (P 0.073, OR 0.18) and mortality (P 0.210, OR 0.19). To investigate the risk of outcome, 59 cases were included following the exclusion of <6 months follow-up. Age (>50 years) was found to be a risk for metastasis and death from the disease. Tumor size (>5 cm) and mitosis (≥5/10-HPF among non-FS-DFSP) were found to be the risk for the LR. Different histological diagnosis was made initially in 32%, and local excision was performed without margins in 65% of vulvar DFSP because of initial incorrect diagnosis. Therefore, pre-treatment biopsy or re-biopsy should be performed with immunohistochemistry for definitive diagnosis to exclude histologic mimics. The optimal treatment is wide local excision with 3-cm margin or with margin assessment for both primary and recurrent DFSP. As most recurrences occur within the first three years of wide excision in DFSP, regular follow-up visits are advocated.", "source": "pubmed"}

This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning (IML) model that effectively predicts in-hospital mortality for ischemic stroke patients.In this study, an IML model was developed and validated using multicenter cohorts of 3225 ischemic stroke patients admitted to the ICU. Nine machine learning (ML) models, including logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and artificial neural network (ANN), were developed to predict in-hospital mortality using data from the MIMIC-IV and externally validated in Shanghai Changhai Hospital. Feature selection was conducted using three algorithms. Model's performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score. Calibration curve and Brier score were used to evaluate the degree of calibration of the model, and decision curve analysis were generated to assess the net clinical benefit. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed to evaluate the risk of in-hospital mortality among ischemic stroke patients admitted to the ICU.Mechanical ventilation, age, statins, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, warfarin, bicarbonate and systolic blood pressure were selected as the nine most influential variables. The RF model demonstrated the most robust predictive performance, achieving AUROC values of 0.908 and 0.858 in the testing set and external validation set, respectively. Calibration curves also revealed a high consistency between observations and predictions. Decision curve analysis showed that the model had the greatest net benefit rate when the prediction probability threshold is 0.10 ∼ 0.80. SHAP was employed to interpret the RF model.

We extracted time-series blood glucose data and applied the Stineman interpolation to achieve a standardized resolution. The primary analysis involved calculating the time-weighted average blood glucose (TWA-BG) and examining its relationship with 28-day mortality using a restricted cubic spline model within a Cox regression framework. Sensitivity analyses with multiple models and subgroup analyses were used to reveal the robustness of the results.From 34 677 identified septic patients, 11 375 met the inclusion criteria. The optimal TWA-BG range, associated with the lowest 28-day mortality risk, was determined to be 105 to 131 mg/dL. Patients within this range exhibited significantly lower mortality rates compared to those with higher or lower TWA-BG levels. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings, indicating robustness across various subgroups and analytical models.Our findings suggest that maintaining TWA-BG levels between 105 and 131 mg/dL minimizes the risk of 28-day, ICU, and in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock.The results provide evidence-based guidance for ICU nursing interventions, advocating for a precise TWA-BG range to be maintained for septic shock patients, thus potentially setting new benchmarks for glycaemic control in critical care settings.", "source": "pubmed"}

Cumulative incidence curve analysis demonstrated a notably increased CHF incidence in patients having higher BCR (18.889 < BCR ≤ 92.5) in contrast to those with lower BCR (2.877 ≤ BCR ≤ 18.889) (p < 0.0001). KM survival analysis indicated a markedly elevated IHM risk in patients with higher BCR in comparison to those with lower BCR (p < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression and RCS analysis further confirmed that higher BCR was linked to a risen likelihood of CHF [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI, 1.15-1.44), p < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis revealed a higher risk of CHF [HR = 1.41, 95% CI (1.13-1.76), p = 0.002] in patients with diabetes than those without [HR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.08-1.41), p = 0.002].Elevated BCR is an independent risk factor for CHF in critically ill COPD individuals and strongly related to a risen risk of CHF. The findings prove BCR as a reliable clinical predictor, facilitating risk stratification and personalized treatment for COPD patients with comorbid CHF.", "source": "pubmed"}

This study investigated the association between the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and mortality among ICU-admitted AMI patients, as well as GNRI's potential to improve the predictive accuracy of current scoring systems.In this retrospective cohort study, data from 5,506 ICU-admitted AMI patients were sourced from three open-access critical care databases. Based on GNRI scores, patients were grouped into two categories: GNRI ≤ 98 and GNRI > 98. Statistical tools such as logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models assessed in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted cubic splines analyzed survival trends and dose-response relationships. Sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability weighting (IPW), and dropping missing data analysis validated the robustness of findings. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve compared GNRI's predictive ability with SOFA and APSIII scores. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a four-tier GNRI classification: no risk (> 98), low risk (92-98), moderate risk (82-<92), and major risk (< 82) to further explore its gradient relationship with mortality.Patients with GNRI ≤ 98 showed higher mortality rates for in-hospital (21.8% vs. 10.4%) and 30-day (22.5% vs. 10.7%) outcomes. GNRI displayed an inverse correlation with in-hospital mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.60) and 30-day mortality (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.66), even after adjusting for confounders.

This study investigates the association between glycemic variability (GV) and short- and long-term clinical outcomes such as poor outcomes at discharge, mortality at 90 days and 1 year and intensive care unit (ICU) /hospital length of stay (LOS) in ICU patients with critically ill cerebral hemorrhage. This retrospective analysis examined 732 ICU patients with non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. GV was quantified as the ratio of standard deviation to mean glucose during ICU stay. To assess associations between GV and clinical outcomes (poor outcomes at discharge, 90-day and 1-year mortality, ICU/hospital LOS), the study employed logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and linear regression. Additionally, non-linear relationships were explored through restricted cubic spline analysis. The investigation further incorporated subgroup and sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness of findings. To evaluate the incremental predictive value of GV, the study utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement, thereby providing a comprehensive assessment of GV's clinical utility. Higher GV was significantly associated with increased risk of poor outcomes at discharge and 90-day and 1-year mortality in both patient groups. GV showed a linear association with poor outcomes at discharge but a non-linear association with 90-day and 1-year mortality. GV thresholds of ≥ 0.11 for non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage increased mortality risks. Cohort showed non-linear relationships between GV and ICU/hospital LOS. GV's impact was stronger in non-hypertensive and male patients. Adding GV to existing severity scores improved their predictive ability for adverse outcomes. In patients with non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage admitted to the ICU, GV demonstrates an independent association with poor outcomes over both short-term and long-term time horizons. Furthermore, GV is associated with extended durations of both ICU and overall hospital stays in this patient population. These findings underscore the importance of glycemic control in this patient population and suggest that GV could be a valuable prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target.", "source": "pubmed"}

The association between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and prognosis among patients with patients is yet to be demonstrated.The aim of this study was to explore the association between MAP and 28-day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis using data from a large, multicenter database.This is a retrospective cohort study. We extracted data of 35,010 patients with sepsis from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database between 2008 and 2019, according to the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria. The MAP was calculated as the average of the highest and lowest readings within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, and patients were divided into 4 groups based on the mean MAP, using the quadruple classification approach. Other worst-case indications from the first 24 hours of ICU admission, such as vital signs, severity of illness scores, laboratory indicators, and therapies, were also gathered as baseline data. The independent effects of MAP on 28-day mortality were explored using binary logistic regression and a two-piecewise linear model, with MAP as the exposure and 28-day mortality as the outcome variables, respectively. To address the nonlinearity relationship, curve fitting and a threshold effect analysis were performed.A total of 34,981 patients with sepsis were included in the final analysis, the mean age was 66.67 (SD 16.01) years, and the 28-day mortality rate was 16.27% (5691/34,981). The generalized additive model and smoothed curve fitting found a U-shaped relationship between MAP and 28-day mortality in these patients. The recursive algorithm determined the low and high inflection points as 70 mm and 82 mm Hg, respectively. Our data demonstrated that MAP was negatively associated with 28-day mortality in the range of 34.05 mm Hg-69.34 mm Hg (odds ratio [OR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.94; P<.001); however, once the MAP exceeded 82 mm Hg, a positive association existed between MAP and 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.02, P=.002).There is a U-shaped association between MAP and the probability of 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

Univariate analysis showed that statin use reduced the risk of AKI by 69% (OR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.27-0.44, p < 0.001) and decreased in-hospital mortality by 57% (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.54, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed the robustness of these findings, with fully adjusted models demonstrating a 31% reduction in AKI (OR = 0.67, p < 0.001) and a 22% reduction in mortality (OR = 0.67, p < 0.001). Subgroup and propensity score-matched analyses further supported these associations, showing consistent protective effects across patient subgroups and a reduction in both AKI and mortality.Pre-ICU statin therapy is associated with a lower risk of AKI and improved in-hospital survival among obese patients with sepsis, suggesting its potential role as a protective measure in this high-risk population.", "source": "pubmed"}

In-hospital mortality was the outcome event. The total samples were divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio by random sampling. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to verify the impact of all variables on the risk of in-hospital mortality, thereby screen potential influencing factors. Subsequently, a stepwise bi-directional regression method was applied to select factors one by one, leading to the construction of a nomogram prediction model. Collinearity testing was used to demonstrate the absence of strong multicollinearity among the influencing factors in the nomogram prediction model. The discrimination of the nomogram model, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) was evaluated using C-index in the test set. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of various models for in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism.A total of 562 patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism were included, including 393 in the training set and 169 in the testing set. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that 30 factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism. Through stepwise bi-directional regression, 12 variables were ultimately selected, including gender, presence of malignant tumors, body temperature, red cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum potassium, prothrombin time (PT), 24-hour urine output, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, warfarin use, and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). Collinearity testing indicated no strong multicollinearity among the influencing factors [all variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10]. A nomogram model was constructed using the 12 variables mentioned above. The nomogram model predicted the C-index and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism better than SOFA score and sPESI [0.771 (0.725-0.816) vs. 0.579 (0.519-0.639), 0.608 (0.554-0.663)]. The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) and its 95%CI of the nomogram model were higher than those of the SOFA score and sPESI [0.811 (0.766-0.857) vs. 0.630 (0.568-0.691), 0.623 (0.566-0.680)]. These findings were consistently replicated in the internal validation of the testing set. In both the training and testing sets, Delong's test showed that the AUC of the nomogram model was significantly higher than the SOFA score and sPESI (both P < 0.05).The nomogram model demonstrated good predictive effectiveness for the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism, enabling clinicians to predict mortality risk in advance and take timely interventions to reduce mortality.", "source": "pubmed"}

Associated baseline data was obtained, cleaned and analyzed. Kaplan Meier (K-M) survival curve and Cox proportional hazards regression model were utilized to evaluate the relationship between RAR and all-cause mortality. Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) was used for exploring how hazard ratio (HR) changes as RAR varied. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and subgroup analysis were conducted to assess the predictive value and to explore the significance of RAR in different populations.499 patients were included in this study. Survival curve showed that patients with RAR > 5.14 had higher mortality rate at 7-day (d), 14-d, 21-d, 28-d, 90-d, 180-d and 1-year (y). The univariate and multivariate Cox models revealed an independent association between high-level RAR and all-cause mortality at 28-d, 90-d and 1-y. RCS showed that RAR became a risk factor when exceeding 5.14. RAR only had linear relationship with mortality at 1-y after adjusting for the potential confounders. Subgroup analysis suggested that increased RAR caused higher risk of death in male, non-white people or those patients without respiratory failure (RF). ROC analysis indicated that compared with other parameters such as SOFA score, RAR exhibited higher efficiency in predicting in-hospital and all-cause mortality at 14-d, 21-d, 28-d, 90-d. Combined RAR with BISAP, RAR-modified BISAP showed superiority in predicting short-term mortality (28-d).For patients with AP in ICU, RAR has a strong association with short- and long-term prognosis.

A 2.5-year-old boy, with no significant medical history, was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe acute respiratory distress, occurring 48 hours after a head trauma. Clinical examination revealed severe dyspnea without fever, and tetraparesis on admission, progressing to tetraplegia during his stay in the intensive care unit, with sensory deficit and abolished deep tendon reflexes, followed by peripheral facial diplegia. Imaging studies were normal, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a characteristic albuminocytologic dissociation, typical of GBS, with no signs of meningitis. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis of GBS was confirmed by an electroneuromyogram (ENMG), showing signs of severe sensory-motor axonal polyradiculoneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy was administered, and the patient's condition gradually improved, leading to extubation after 20 days of respiratory support. The risk factors for respiratory failure and biological markers, such as lymphopenia, are also discussed in this case report. Although GBS is a rare pediatric neurological emergency, this case illustrates how the condition can mimic other pathologies and occur in the context of head trauma, particularly in cases with axonal involvement.

Nonetheless, the link between PIV and prognosis in PE remains unclear. However, few studies have specifically focused on critically ill patients with PE in ICUs. This study retrospectively analyzed electronic health data of patients with PE from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was 28-day ACM; secondary outcomes were 90-day, 1-year, ICU, and in-hospital mortality. The study population included 213 patients with PE. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that elevated PIV was significantly associated with ACM at 28 days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-3.63) and 90 days (aHR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.10-3.47). Further, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PIV was significantly and positively associated with the risk of ACM. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that PIV was positively associated with ACM. Subgroup and interaction analyses corroborated this correlation. PIV was significantly correlated with ACM in critically ill ICU patients with PE. This correlation highlights the potential utility of PIV for stratifying patients with PE according to their risk of death.", "source": "pubmed"}

Exposures included the occurrence the timing of hyperkalemia and the numeric values of serum potassium. The outcomes included ICU mortality and 7 days and 30 days mortality after ICU admission. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each exposure for the outcomes. Subgroup analyses after full adjustment were conducted. A total of 22,370 ICU patients were included in this study. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was 18.8%. Patients with and without hyperkalemia differed significantly in a number of baseline characteristics. The ICU mortality, 7 days mortality, and 30 days mortality rates in the overall population were 12.6%, 9.5%, and 19.1%, respectively. After full adjustment, the occurrence of hyperkalemia is closely associated with the ICU mortality (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.22-1.58) and 30 days mortality (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.31) of the ICU patients. The timing of hyperkalemia is also associated with the risk of mortalities. These associations remained unchanged in the multiple regression analysis after full adjustment for the demographic variables, clinical tests, and comorbidities. In conclusion, the occurrence and timing of hyperkalemia are closely associated with the ICU and 30 days mortalities of critically ill patients. Once hyperkalemia occurs, active interventions are needed to restore serum potassium levels, regardless of the numeric values, to normal as quickly as possible.", "source": "pubmed"}

This is associated with one part of the intestine telescoping into another, resulting in bowel edema. If the intussusception remains untreated, obstruction, ischemia, necrosis, and perforation may result. Most cases are idiopathic, with 10-25 % associated with a pathologic mass or lead point. The most common age group affected includes those between 3 months to 5 years. The triad of intermittent abdominal pain, currant jelly stool, and sausage-shaped mass is uncommon, though most patients will present with intermittent abdominal pain. Nonbilious emesis and bloody stools (gross blood or guaiac positive) are also common. Younger patients can present atypically, including altered mental status or lethargy. Thus, intussusception should be considered in pediatric patients with abdominal pain, emesis, and a sausage-shaped mass, as well as those with atypical presentations such as altered mental status or lethargy if there is no other etiology found on testing. The diagnostic modality of choice is ultrasound. Plain radiography may assist in evaluating for obstruction and perforation. Treatment includes prompt reduction of the intussusception. In patients who are stable and have no evidence of perforation, non-operative reduction with hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction should be attempted. Operative intervention is necessary in those who are unstable, peritonitic, or have a focal lead point. Discharge may be appropriate for patients following successful non-operative reduction if the patient is able to tolerate clear fluids, is asymptomatic, and can return for any recurrence of symptoms.An understanding of pediatric intussusception and its many potential mimics can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this high risk disease.", "source": "pubmed"}

The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between 24-h heart rate fluctuations after admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates in patients with AMI in order to examine its implications for prognosis in AMI patients.All data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III Database (MIMIC III). We calculated heart rate fluctuations using the maximum and minimum values of the patient's heart rate during the first 24 h after ICU admission and divided them into three groups (< 23beats/min, 23-33beats/min, > 33beats/min) according to tertiles. The COX risk regression model was applied to the analysis, and subgroup analyses were performed for use in testing the robustness of the results. Curve fitting was performed to explore whether there was a nonlinear relationship between heart rate fluctuations and mortality. Outcome measures were 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality in patients with AMI.After strict confounding adjustment, COX multifactorial analysis showed that patients' heart rate fluctuations were positively associated with 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates (HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.11 ~ 1.23; HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.12 ~ 1.22; HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.12 ~ 1.21).

Serum phosphate level trajectories were constructed using a latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) based on four measurements of serum phosphate at six-hour intervals within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The relationship between serum phosphate levels at ICU admission and serum phosphate level trajectories and the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis was analyzed using Cox regression models, and hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.Of these 1,703 patients with sepsis included, 566 (33.24%) died within 28 days. The median serum phosphate levels of the patients were 4.10 (3.00, 5.50) mg/dL. Four serum phosphate level trajectories were classified: normal-level-steady trend (trajectory 1), high-level-steady trend (trajectory 2), high-level-decreasing trend (trajectory 3), and high-level-increasing trend (trajectory 4). High serum phosphate levels at admission were associated with a higher risk of 28-day mortality (HR = 1.05, 95%CI: 1.01-1.09) in patients with sepsis. For trajectories, trajectory 2 (HR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.05-1.54) related to an increased risk of 28-day mortality compared with trajectory 1, whereas trajectory 4 (HR = 1.69, 95%CI: 0.99-2.91, P = 0.056) may be related.

Compared with late SA-AKI patients, early SA-AKI patients had no significant differences in all-cause mortality at 28 days, 60 days or 180 days, renal replacement therapy (RRT) rates; or major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE-30). However, the renal recovery of early SA-AKI patients was significantly better than that of late SA-AKI patients, their lengths of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were significantly shorter, and the number of patients with positive fluid balance was lower, but the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nephrotoxic antibiotics and the incidence of septic shock were higher. In addition, there was a difference in the number of patients with early and late SA-AKI at highest AKI stages 1 and 3. Data analysis also revealed that liver disease, cancer, highest AKI stage 3 and septic shock were associated with renal nonrecovery.Although there was no significant difference in mortality between early and late SA-AKI patients, there were significant differences in renal recovery, positive fluid balance, nephrotoxic antibiotic use, septic shock and AKI stage.

This puts patients at increased risk to develop delirium with consequent fiscal pressure for the health care system. An underappreciated dimension is how time-specific patient phenotypes in the critical care environment relate to clinical outcomes. We set out to analyze how rhythmic components (or the lack thereof) in physiological data streams sampled at high resolution in the ICU were associated with the future incidence of delirium and death. To offer cues for further interrogation into mechanism and risk prognosis, we examined differences in 24-hour fluctuations of clinical labs in ICU patient populations at risk.Rhythmic components using dipping ratios and JTK_CYCLE statistics were derived from 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate measurements available from ICU patient admissions recorded in the MIMIC IV database. Logistic adjusted regression models assessed the association between disrupted vital sign rhythms and the future incidence of delirium during the same hospital admission and death. Aggregation of numeric clinical lab measurements across the first 24 hours from all patient admissions allowed modelling of rhythmic patterns and subsequent association studies to link potential biochemical mechanisms to perturbed vital sign rhythms and adverse ICU outcomes.Patients with reverse blood pressure dipping were at a 40% higher risk to have a diagnosis of delirium (Odds Ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.14-1.72) and a 13% increased risk of death (Odds Ratio: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.26). Compared to the patient population with nocturnal blood pressure dip, reverse dippers showed 24-hour biochemistry profiles suggestive of altered circadian programs specifically in clinical parameters of renal, metabolic, and hemostatic function.Reverse blood pressure dipping can be an early sign for the future development of delirium in the ICU and is accompanied by disrupted biorhythms across multiple organ systems. Dampened and reversed heart rate and blood pressure rhythms are associated with a higher risk for death in ICU patients.

Accurate prediction of CCI in this patient population is essential for effective management and intervention. This study aims to develop a web-based artificial intelligence (AI) application designed to predict CCI in ICU patients suffering from bone trauma.A cohort of 1049 patients were included in the study, with 775 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and 274 patients from two tertiary hospitals. Five machine learning techniques and logistic regression were employed to develop the models, using 80% of the MIMIC-III cohort. The models' internal effectiveness was evaluated using the remaining 20% of the cohort, and external validation was performed on the 274 prospective patients. Eleven evaluation metrics were used to develop a scoring system for comprehensive performance evaluation.Among all the models evaluated, the eXGBoosting Machine (eXGBM) model demonstrated the highest performance in internal validation, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.979 (95%CI: 0.970-0.991). It outperformed the Random Forest (RF) model, which had an AUC of 0.957 (95%CI: 0.941-0.967), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which achieved an AUC of 0.911 (95%CI: 0.878-0.928). The Logistic Regression (LR) model had a relatively lower AUC of 0.753 (95%CI: 0.714-0.793).

Additionally, based on the scoring system, the eXGBM model achieved the highest prediction score of 60, followed by the RF model with a score of 52 and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model with a score of 39. External validation of the eXGBM model resulted in an AUC of 0.887 (95%CI: 0.863-0.917), confirming its robust performance and generalizability. A user-friendly web-based AI application based on the eXGBM model was successfully developed and was freely accessible at the Internet.The development of a web-based AI application utilizing the eXGBM model demonstrates a promising advancement in the prediction of CCI among ICU patients. With favorable performance in both internal and external validation, the AI application not only achieved high accuracy and reliability but also provided a user-friendly tool for clinicians.

In addition to their robust acute and long-term effects on weight, metabolism, and blood pressure, these agents also reduce cardiovascular mortality as well as stroke risk and associated consequences. A replicated and convergent body of preclinical evidence also indicates that incretin receptor agonists activate molecular effectors critical to neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and anti-apoptosis. Herein, we propose that GLP-1 RAs and GIP RAs are promising transdiagnostic mechanistically informed therapeutics in the treatment and prevention of multiple domains of psychopathology, including general cognitive, reward, and motivation systems and mental disorders. Major neurocognitive disorders (eg, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease), alcohol and substance use disorders, traumatic brain injury, and depressive disorders are near-term therapeutic targets. In addition, GLP-1 RAs and GIP RAs have robust effects on comorbidities that differentially affect persons with mental disorders (eg, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disorders) and psychotropic drug-related weight gain.", "source": "pubmed"}

However, despite the abundance of feature selection (FS) methods available, challenges remain in choosing the most appropriate method, deciding how many top-ranked variables to include, and ensuring these selections are meaningful from a medical perspective.We developed a practical multi-step feature selection (FS) framework that integrates data-driven statistical inference with a knowledge verification strategy. This framework was validated using two distinct EMR datasets targeting different clinical outcomes. The first cohort, sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), focused on predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients. The second cohort, drawn from the MIMIC-IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED), aimed to estimate in-hospital mortality (IHM) for patients transferred from the ED to the ICU. We employed various machine learning (ML) methods and conducted a comparative analysis considering accuracy, stability, similarity, and interpretability. The effectiveness of our FS framework was evaluated using discrimination and calibration metrics, with SHAP applied to enhance the interpretability of model decisions.Cohort 1 comprised 48,780 ICU encounters, of which 8,883 (18.21%) developed AKI. Cohort 2 included 29,197 transfers from the ED to the ICU, with 3,219 (11.03%) resulting in IHM. Among the ten ML methods evaluated, the tree-based ensemble method achieved the highest accuracy. As the number of top-ranking features increased, the models' accuracy began to stabilize, while feature subset stability (considering sample variations) and inter-method feature similarity reached optimal levels, confirming the validity of the FS framework. The integration of interpretative methods and expert knowledge in the final step further improved feature interpretability. The FS framework effectively reduced the number of features (e.g., from 380 to 35 for Cohort 1, and from 273 to 54 for Cohort 2) without significantly affecting prediction performance (Delong test, p > 0.05).The multi-step FS method developed in this study successfully reduces the dimensionality of features in EMR while preserving the accuracy of clinical outcome prediction. Furthermore, it improves the interpretability of risk factors by incorporating expert knowledge validation.", "source": "pubmed"}

LAR was calculated from the ratio obtained from the first measurement taken within 24 h of admission. The optimal LAR threshold was determined using R statistical software. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare mortality risks between two patient groups, while multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between LAR and mortality risk in patients with cirrhosis and concomitant sepsis. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to explore potential dose-response relationships between LAR and mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to assess the predictive ability, sensitivity, and specificity of LAR for all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and combined sepsis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the relationship between LAR and prognosis across different populations.A total of 1731 patients were included in the study. The optimal LAR threshold was identified as 1.0 using R statistical software. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with higher LAR levels had a higher risk of 14-day, 28-day, and 90-day all-cause mortality (all log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models indicated independent associations between higher LAR levels and all-cause mortality at 14-day, 28-day, and 90-day before and after adjusting for confounders. RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear association between LAR and short- and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis. ROC curve analysis showed that although the predictive value of LAR for the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis combined with sepsis was slightly inferior to that of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, it was significantly better than that of lactate, albumin, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Subgroup analyses showed no significant interactions between LAR and any specific subgroup.LAR has good predictive value for the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and sepsis.", "source": "pubmed"}

Our research, which involved screening over 14,669 healthy individuals enrolled in the Qatar BioBank (QBB) and sequenced by the Qatar Genome Project (QGP), identified individuals carrying protective variants against age-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and atherosclerosis. In this study, we measured methylation levels in blood DNA using the EPIC v2 arrays. In addition, epigenetic age was calculated using various epigenetic clocks. Our analysis revealed that the APOE*E2 protective variant reduces the rate of GrimAge epigenetic aging when compared to individuals with the APOE4 AD risk allele. Furthermore, our differential DNA methylation analysis discovered the association of the PCSK9 protective variant with specific biological processes related to immune function and the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, APOE*E2 protective variants have a positive impact on epigenetic aging, while PCSK9 protective variants have a significant effect on DNA methylation signatures. Further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms by which protective variants influence epigenetic aging, particularly the role of APOE*E2 protective variants in biological aging.

To investigate the nature of this association, we applied restricted cubic spline analysis to determine if it is linear. The predictive ability of SHR for mortality risk was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the C-index.We included a total of 2,461 patients, with a mean age of 70.55 ± 14.59 years, and 1,221 (49.61%) being female. Cox regression analysis revealed that SHR was independently associated with both in-hospital mortality (per standard deviation (SD) increase: hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.48) and ICU mortality (per SD increase: HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21-1.54). The risk of death increased in an approximately linear fashion when SHR exceeded 0.77-0.79. Subgroup analysis indicated the association was more pronounced in non-diabetic individuals. Additionally, incorporating SHR into existing models improved both discrimination and reclassification performance.SHR serves as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in cerebrovascular disease patients in the ICU. Adding SHR to existing models enhances their predictive performance, offering clinical value in the identification of high-risk patients.", "source": "pubmed"}

To address missing values and dataset imbalances, novel computational methods were introduced. The model achieved an AUROC of 77.3% and AUPRC of 40.4% on validation, with similar results on external datasets from MIMIC-IV and Rambam Hospital. The model also predicted mortality risk, identifying a 30% mortality rate in high-risk patients versus 16.8% in low-risk groups. External validation on the eICU database showed a comparable gap, with mortality rates at 24% for high-risk and 7.7% for low-risk groups.

Early forewarning and diagnosis of SS, which are critical in reducing mortality, are still challenging in clinical management.We propose a simple and fast risk-stratified forewarning model for SS to help physicians recognize patients in time. Moreover, further insights can be gained from the application of the model to improve our understanding of SS.A total of 5125 patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database were divided into training, validation, and test sets. In addition, 2180 patients with sepsis from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) were used as an external validation set. We developed a simplified risk-stratified early forewarning model for SS based on the weight of evidence and logistic regression, which was compared with multi-feature complex models, and clinical characteristics among risk groups were evaluated.Using only vital signs and rapid arterial blood gas test features according to feature importance, we constructed the Septic Shock Risk Predictor (SORP), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9458 in the test set, which is only slightly lower than that of the optimal multi-feature complex model (0.9651). A median forewarning time of 13 hours was calculated for SS patients. 4 distinct risk groups (high, medium, low, and ultralow) were identified by the SORP 6 hours before onset, and the incidence rates of SS in the 4 risk groups in the postonset interval were 88.6% (433/489), 34.5% (262/760), 2.5% (67/2707), and 0.3% (4/1301), respectively. The severity increased significantly with increasing risk in both clinical features and survival. Clustering analysis demonstrated a high similarity of pathophysiological characteristics between the high-risk patients without SS diagnosis (NS_HR) and the SS patients, while a significantly worse overall survival was shown in NS_HR patients. On further exploring the characteristics of the treatment and comorbidities of the NS_HR group, these patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of mean blood pressure <65 mmHg, significantly lower vasopressor use and infused volume, and more severe renal dysfunction. The above findings were further validated by multicenter eICU data.The SORP demonstrated accurate forewarning and a reliable risk stratification capability. Among patients forewarned as high risk, similar pathophysiological phenotypes and high mortality were observed in both those subsequently diagnosed as having SS and those without such a diagnosis. NS_HR patients, overlooked by the Sepsis-3 definition, may provide further insights into the pathophysiological processes of SS onset and help to complement its diagnosis and precise management. The importance of precise fluid resuscitation management in SS patients with renal dysfunction is further highlighted.

However, the optimal timing for CRRT initiation remains controversial.Using the MIMIC-IV database for model development and the eICU database for external validation, we analyzed patients with S-AKI to compare survival rates between early and late CRRT initiation groups. Propensity score matching was performed to address potential selection bias. Subgroup analyses stratified patients by disease severity using SOFA scores (low ≤10, medium 11-15, high >15) and creatinine levels (low ≤3 mg/dL, medium 3-5 mg/dL, high >5 mg/dL). Multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict patient prognosis, with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identifying key prognostic factors.After propensity score matching, late CRRT initiation was associated with improved survival probability, but led to increased hospital and ICU stays. Subgroup analyses showed consistent trends favoring late CRRT across all SOFA categories, with the most pronounced effect in high SOFA scores (>15, While later initiation of CRRT in S-AKI patients was associated with improved survival, this benefit comes with increased healthcare resource utilization. The clinical parameters, rather than CRRT timing, are the primary determinants of patient outcomes, suggesting the need for a more personalized approach to CRRT initiation based on overall illness severity.", "source": "pubmed"}

This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for the occurrence of multiple complications (three or more) in patients with HBC and to explore the effects of multiple complications on HBC prognosis.In this retrospective cohort study, data from 121 HBC patients treated at Nanjing Second Hospital from February 2009 to November 2019 were analysed. The maximum follow-up period was 10.75 years, with a median of 5.75 years. Eight machine learning techniques were employed to construct predictive models, including C5.0, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), generalised linear model (GLM) and naive Bayes (NB), utilising variables such as medical history, demographics, clinical signs, and laboratory test results. Model performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, residual analysis, calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The influence of multiple complications on HBC survival time was assessed via Kaplan‒Meier curve analysis. Furthermore, LASSO and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with HBC, followed by ROC, C-index, calibration curve, and DCA curve analyses of the constructed prognostic nomogram model. This study utilized bootstrap resampling for internal validation and employed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database for external validation.The GBDT model exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) and emerged as the optimal model for predicting the occurrence of multiple complications. The key predictive factors included posthospitalisation fever (PHF), body mass index (BMI), retinol binding protein (RBP), total bilirubin (TB) levels, and eosinophils (EOS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with multiple complications had significantly worse OS than those with fewer complications. Additionally, multivariable Cox regression analysis, informed by least absolute shrinkage and LASSO selection, identified hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), multiple complications, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels as independent prognostic factors for OS. The prognostic model demonstrated 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS ROC AUCs of 0.802, 0.793, and 0.817, respectively. For the internal validation cohort, the corresponding AUC values were 0.797, 0.832, and 0.835. In contrast, the external validation cohort yielded a 1-year ROC AUC of 0.707. Calibration curves indicated good consistency of the model, and DCA demonstrated the model's clinical utility, showing high net benefits within certain threshold ranges. Compared with the univariable models, the multivariable ROC curves indicated higher AUC values for this prognostic model, and the model also possessed the best c-index.The GBDT prediction model provides a reliable tool for the early identification of high-risk HBC patients prone to developing multiple complications. The concurrent occurrence of multiple complications is an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with HBC.

In this study, we explored the relationship between DEX use and clinical outcomes of patients with SIMI, focusing on the dosage and treatment duration.In this retrospective cohort analysis, we identified patients with SIMI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and categorized them into the DEX and non-DEX groups based on intensive care unit treatment. The baseline bias was reduced through propensity score matching (PSM). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, whereas the secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and mortality rates at 7 days, 90 days, and 1 year. The association between DEX use and in-hospital mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.After PSM, 373 patients in the DEX group were matched with 579 patients in the non-DEX group to achieve a balanced distribution of the covariates. The Cox regression model demonstrated a significant reduction in the 28-day mortality associated with DEX use, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-0.78, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality also significantly decreased (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33-0.57, P < 0.001). Lower mortality rates were observed at 7 days, 90 days, and 1 year. DEX doses >0.4 μg/kg/h, particularly in the range of 0.400-0.612 μg/kg/h, total doses >3.113 mg during hospitalization, and treatment durations exceeding 72 h were associated with improved mortality risk at all intervals. Regarding DEX efficacy at 28 days, our subgroup analyses indicated a significant interaction between the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and invasive mechanical ventilation.DEX administration was associated with improved in-hospital mortality and reduced mortality rates at 7 days, 28 days, 90 days, and 1 year in patients with SIMI. These findings require validation in future studies.", "source": "pubmed"}

In this study, we investigated the relationship between nine inflammatory indicators and prognosis in critically ill patients with T2DM to provide a clinical reference for assessing the prognosis of patients admitted to the ICU. Critically ill patients with T2DM were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided into training and testing sets (7:3 ratio). An external validation cohort was collected from a single center in China using identical criteria. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between nine inflammatory indicators and ICU, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates. Significant predictive variables were chosen using least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression from logistic regression results, and a prognostic prediction model was built with multivariate logistic regression. The model was validated in both test and external validation sets. A total of 4,783 patients were included for model development and testing; an additional 204 served as the external validation set. The levels of eight inflammatory indicators were significantly correlated with short-term prognosis in critically ill patients with T2DM (P < 0.05 for all). The prediction model showed excellent discrimination performance, with AUC values of 0.825 (95% CI, 0.785-0.864) in the test set and 0.741 (95% CI, 0.630-0.851) in the external validation set. Calibration curves demonstrated strong consistency in both sets. In addition, decision curve analysis showed a net clinical benefit within 1-60% threshold probability in the test set and 10-41% threshold probability in the external validation set. Eight inflammatory indicators were identified as independent risk factors for prognosis in critically ill patients with T2DM. The prediction model showed promising performance in both internal and external validation cohorts, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for early risk stratification and prediction of the outcomes of personalized treatment strategies in ICU settings.", "source": "pubmed"}

Malnutrition significantly impacts the prognosis of patients with AP, so effective tools are needed to identify those at high nutritional risk. This study validated the ability of the modified NUTRIC score to predict all-cause mortality and identify nutritional risk in patients with acute pancreatitis in the ICU.This retrospective study analyzed data from the MIMIC-IV (v2.2) database, which included patients admitted to the ICU with AP between 2008 and 2019. Patients were categorized into high (mNUTRIC score ≥ 5) and low (mNUTRIC score < 5) nutritional risk groups. The findings were analyzed using Cox regression, ROC curve, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.A total of 670 AP patients were included in the study. Patients at high nutritional risk had significantly worse clinical outcomes, including higher 28-day (30.0 % vs. 5.4 %) and 90-day (39.41 % vs. 10.2 %) mortality rates, compared to patients with low nutritional risk. The mNUTRIC score demonstrated stronger predictive ability for the 28-day (AUC: 0.797) and 90-day (AUC: 0.772) mortality compared to other nutritional risk tools used in the ICU, including the SOFA, APACHE II, and OASIS scores. A Cox regression analysis revealed that higher mNUTRIC scores were independently associated with increased mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed that patients at high nutritional risk had significantly lower survival probabilities than those at low risk (P < 0.001). Patients with high nutritional risk who received nutrition intervention had a higher survival probability compared to those who did not (P < 0.001).The mNUTRIC score is an effective tool for predicting the mortality in patients with AP. The mNUTRIC score stratifies patients with AP into different risk groups and predicts their all-cause mortality, highlighting the importance of nutritional interventions in improving survival outcomes, especially for patients at high risk.", "source": "pubmed"}

This study aims to investigate the relationship between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with HF.Data from the MIMIC-IV database were extracted for subjects eligible for HF diagnosis. We utilized the restricted cubic spline (RCS) method, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves, and Cox regression analysis to assess the association between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and all-cause mortality in HF patients. Overlap weighting (OW) and subgroup analysis were employed to enhance the robustness and reliability of the study.A total of 3,065 subjects were enrolled in this study. RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between LDH levels and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with HF, with a hazard ratio (HR) > 1 when LDH exceeded 315 U/L. The K-M survival curve indicated lower survival rates and shorter survival times in subjects with LDH ≥ 315 U/L. Elevated LDH levels were independently associated with increased in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates, with adjusted HR of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.67) and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.45), respectively. The results remained consistently robust in the OW analyses.Elevated LDH levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in ICU-admitted HF patients. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm this association.", "source": "pubmed"}

We aim to bridge the gap between these 2 categories by building on modern interpretable machine learning (ML) techniques to design interpretable mortality risk scores that are as accurate as black boxes.We developed a new algorithm, GroupFasterRisk, which has several important benefits: it uses both hard and soft direct sparsity regularization, it incorporates group sparsity to allow more cohesive models, it allows for monotonicity constraint to include domain knowledge, and it produces many equally good models, which allows domain experts to choose among them. For evaluation, we leveraged the largest existing public ICU monitoring datasets (MIMIC III and eICU).Models produced by GroupFasterRisk outperformed OASIS and SAPS II scores and performed similarly to APACHE IV/IVa while using at most a third of the parameters. For patients with sepsis/septicemia, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and acute kidney failure, GroupFasterRisk models outperformed OASIS and SOFA. Finally, different mortality prediction ML approaches performed better based on variables selected by GroupFasterRisk as compared to OASIS variables.GroupFasterRisk's models performed better than risk scores currently used in hospitals, and on par with black box ML models, while being orders of magnitude sparser. Because GroupFasterRisk produces a variety of risk scores, it allows design flexibility-the key enabler of practical model creation.GroupFasterRisk is a fast, accessible, and flexible procedure that allows learning a diverse set of sparse risk scores for mortality prediction.", "source": "pubmed"}

However, the prognostic relevance of ACAG in individuals of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains insufficiently explored. This research seeks to evaluate the correlation between ACAG levels and mortality risk in individuals with AF.We identified individuals diagnosed with AF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Participants were categorized into quartiles based on their ACAG levels. The outcomes included 30 days and 365 days all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were utilized to evaluate cumulative survival across the ACAG quartiles. We applied Cox regression and restricted cubic spline regression analyses to evaluate the correlation between ACAG levels and prognosis. Subgroup analyses and interaction assessments were applied to confirm the robustness of the findings.A total of 2920 AF patients (54.93% male) were incorporated into the analysis, with 1.61% identified as having paroxysmal AF. The 30-day and 365-day mortality rates were 22.91% and 39.21%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that elevated ACAG levels were significantly linked to increased mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses, increased ACAG independently predicted mortality at both 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P < 0.01) and 365 days (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P < 0.01) after adjusting for potential confounders. A positive relationship between rising ACAG levels and mortality risk was showed by restricted cubic spline analysis. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant interactions (all interaction P-values > 0.05).In individuals with AF, higher ACAG levels are related to a greater mortality risk at 30 and 365 days. These findings suggest that ACAG may serve as a valuable prognostic marker for AF patient stratification. Incorporating ACAG into clinical decision-making could support improved therapeutic strategies and enhance patient outcomes.", "source": "pubmed"}
